Analysis of Evidence
Thus, from the indictment the ultimate probandum can be formulated:
1 Richard Able (“RA”) knowingly ﬁled a false federal tax return for the year 2003 (“the
2003 return”) with intent to defraud the government of income tax due and owing on
not less than $45,000.
Step 3. Formulate the potential penultimate probanda. The ultimate probandum for
United States v. Able can be divided into seven penultimate probanda:
2 RA knowingly ﬁled a false income tax return for the year 2003.
3 RA ﬁled a tax return for the year 2003.
4 The tax return that RA ﬁled for 2003 was false.
5 RA knew his 2003 tax return was false when he ﬁled it.
6 At the time RA ﬁled his 2003 tax return, he intended to defraud the government of
income tax due and owing on not less than $45,000.
7 RA owed the government taxes on an additional $45,000 at the time he ﬁled his 2003
tax return.
8 RA intended to defraud the government of the taxes due and owing at the time he
ﬁled his 2003 tax return.
In United States v. Able the law was reasonably clear. However, situations often
arise in which it is not certain how a court will interpret the applicable law. For
instance, in Sargent (page 28) it is not clear how a court will interpret the insurance
policy: Would being killed by a bear or dying from starvation count as an “accidental
injury”? Such questions need to be researched, but if research does not provide a
clear answer, how is the analyst to proceed? There is no easy way out. As a rule
of thumb one needs to prepare alternative arguments based on “pessimistic” and
“optimistic” interpretations of the applicable law, bearing in mind that the most
pessimistic interpretation is likely to be the foundation for the strongest case that
one’s opponent is likely to present.
Step 4. Formulate the provisional theories of the case (and choose the strategic ulti-
mate, penultimate, and intermediate probanda that best ﬁt the theory or theories).
For any case, the analyst must formulate what she sees as the strongest provisional
theories of the case for both sides. This is necessary for two reasons. First, the advo-
cate needs to know the theory she is most likely to confront in order to assess how
the evidence will be marshaled against her client. Second, if the opposing theory
is not developed, the advocate may wind up developing a theory that misses the
point, a theory that attacks a “straw man.”4
4 If the problem is a complex one involving a mixed mass of evidence, it is likely that there will be a
range of possible theories each of which would lead the analysis in signiﬁcantly different directions.
In order to make the task manageable, it may be necessary to eliminate some possibilities and
concentrate on one or more speciﬁc theories. Even historians and scientists do not have inﬁnite
resources to pursue endless lines of inquiry. Typically advocates have to settle for one theory (or at
least a limited number) at a fairly early stage. The precise timing of such choices naturally varies
according to circumstance. On the relationship between stories, theories, and themes see Ch. 10
below.

The chart method
127
Thus, for United States v. Able, in order to effectively develop a theory for the
defense, we need to identify the theory that the prosecutors are likely to adopt. For
the government in Able, the theory is likely to be:
Prior to leaving practice in 2002, RA was earning more than $450,000 per year.
When he became a professor, his income dropped precipitously. The amount
he needed to support the lifestyle he wanted to maintain and meet his other
obligations exceeded the amount that the law school paid him. His income for
2003 was $170,000 – $125,000 from the law school and $45,000 in fees. In order
to avoid paying the additional amount that was due as a result of the $45,000 in
fees he had received, RA ﬁled a false tax return that only reported the $125,000 he
had earned as salary and from which an amount sufﬁcient to satisfy the taxes due
on that amount had been withheld. Thus, RA knowingly ﬁled a false tax return
for 2003 with intent to defraud the federal government of the taxes that were due
and owing on the additional $45,000 he had received as fees.
Given the probable theory the government will adopt, the strongest provisional
theory for Able might be:
RA fully disclosed all his income to Timothy Cooper, his accountant, and relied
upon Cooper to prepare and ﬁle his pre-signed return. RA informed Cooper he
had received $125,000 in salary from the law school at their ﬁrst meeting. On
April 12, his girlfriend, Jane Evans, delivered a letter to Cooper’s ofﬁce advising
him that RA had also earned $45,000 in fees. With that letter RA enclosed a blank
tax return that he had signed and a signed check payable to the Internal Revenue
Service with the amount left blank. In that letter, RA advised Cooper that he
was going to be out of town until after April 15, 2004, and instructed Cooper to
complete the return and to insert in the check the amount that was due to the
government. Thus, RA did not know that the tax return Cooper prepared and
ﬁled was false and RA fully intended to pay any additional taxes that were due
and owing on the $45,000 he had received as fees.
Having identiﬁed these provisional theories, it is possible to strategically refor-
mulatethepenultimateprobandatosimplifytheanalysisbyrephrasingpropositions
3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 to focus the analysis more precisely on the material facts that are in
dispute:
3 An income tax return for the year 2003 (“the 2003 return”) signed by RA was ﬁled.
4 The 2003 return was false.
5 At the time the 2003 return was ﬁled, RA knew that the 2003 return was false.
7 At the time the 2003 return was ﬁled, RA owed the government taxes on the $45,000
RA received as fees during the year 2003.
8 At the time the 2003 return was ﬁled, RA intended to defraud the government of the
taxes due and owing on $45,000.

Analysis of Evidence
As restated, only penultimate probanda 5 and 8 are in dispute. These propositions
should be the analyst’s “targets” in analyzing and marshaling the evidence . This
macroscopic analysis of the case is depicted in charted form in Figure 5.1.
Figure 5.1 Chart (Able)
Step 5. Formulate the key-list.
a. What is a key-list? A key-list is a numbered list of propositions of three kinds.
First, there are the propositions developed and reﬁned at the macroscopic level –
the ultimate and penultimate probanda and propositions identiﬁed as necessary in
light of the provisional theory adopted, e.g., that OJS had a motive to murder NBS.
Second, there are propositions that can be directly inferred from the evidential data,
e.g., from an autoptic proference of the 2003 tax return, we can infer that the tax
return reported that RA only earned $125,000 in 2003. Third, the list includes all
the intermediate proponent’s assertions, opponent’s explanatory, rival, and denial
propositions, and any propositions the proponent may use to undermine the oppo-
nent’s propositions or to strengthen her assertion in light of the opponent’s attacks.
Collectively, the key-list must include every proposition that the analyst concludes
is important to the arguments in support of and against the ultimate probandum.
The list is a key-list because every symbol in the chart has a number that identiﬁes
the proposition on the key-list which it depicts.
b. Formulating the propositions. The ﬁrst step is to identify those items of evi-
dential data that are available to be offered and convert them into simple proposi-
tions–i.e.propositionsinvolvingonlyoneconditionandsusceptibletotheresponse
“true/false,” “proven/not proven,” “probable/not probable,” etc. The next step is to
identifyeachinferredpropositionthatisnecessarytoshowhowanevidentialpropo-
sition supports or undermines a fact of consequence – a penultimate probandum or

the credibility of a witness’s assertion. The process is not as mechanical as it might
seem. The analyst must confront two types of difﬁculty.
First, formulating the propositions on a key-list involves more than merely mak-
ing explicit what was perhaps formerly implicit or only partially expressed. It also
involves reﬁnement of expression, analogous to what is involved in drafting a statute
or formal document on the basis of a rough set of instructions. Indeed, the formu-
lation of the ultimate probandum may well require the same level of drafting skill
and precision. The formulation of evidential data into key-list propositions does
not require, for most practical purposes, the same degree of precision and rigor as
the drafting of legal instruments. The point at which precision becomes pedantry
typically depends on context. But the analogy with drafting is nevertheless useful.
Second, identifying and formulating the intermediate inferential propositions
necessary to establish the relevance of an evidential proposition to a fact of conse-
quence (a penultimate probandum or a proposition bearing upon the credibility
of a testimonial assertion or an item of tangible evidence) is ordinarily the hardest
and most important task. For example, the endorsement by the Las Vegas branch
of Able’s bank on the $25,000 check that Richard Able received from the New York
law ﬁrm supports a chain of inferences leading to an inference that RA had motive
to ﬁle a false tax return to avoid paying taxes on that amount. But the weaknesses
in that argument become apparent only if the intermediate inferential steps nec-
essary to support motive are identiﬁed with precision – i.e. RA gambled with all
or substantially all of the $25,000 supporting a further inference that RA lost all or
substantially all of the $25,000. The explanations that undermine the strength of
these inferences – i.e. RA may not have gambled or may have gambled with only a
modest amount, and RA may have won or may have quit after he had lost an amount
he could comfortably afford – and the generalizations that make them plausible are
not apparent absent precision.
There are no ﬁxed rules for drafting propositions, but it is possible to give some
guidance by way of advice. For example: Be precise. Be clear (avoid ambiguities).
Normally, each proposition on the key-list should make one point only, and this
should be signaled (for example, “It was OJS who killed NBS” rather than “OJS
killedNBS”).Sotoo,wherepossible,propositionsshouldbestatedintheafﬁrmative
rather than the negative. Trying to chart a negative creates difﬁculties that should
be unnecessary. Choose an appropriate level of generality for each proposition. So
far as possible, use language that signals clearly the connections with immediately
adjacent propositions. Be succinct and strive for economy – a cogent argument
needs to be well structured, economical, and clear. Again, skill in drafting a key-list
involves art as well as science.
c. Selecting propositions to be included. From the universe of data available, the
key-list may (and probably must) be limited to what is relevant to the ultimate
probandum. But visualizing what is relevant requires an intuitive application of the
inductive process we are trying to make explicit. Beware of cutting out potentially
relevant material too early; err on the side of over-inclusion in the ﬁrst cut. It is
simple to strike unnecessary evidentiary propositions from the key-list after the

Analysis of Evidence
chart is complete; it may well be impossible to see signiﬁcant relations if necessary
data have been omitted.
The process of developing and organizing the key-list is also reﬂexive. The ulti-
mate and penultimate probanda suggest intermediate probanda we want to reach.
But the evidential proposition may also suggest direct and intermediate inferences
and combinations whose relevance will be apparent only when formulated. The
propositions on the list should be ordered “logically,” but there is a danger that
too early an effort at structure and coherence will cause us to overlook important
hypotheses.
Several points deserve further comment. First, identifying standpoint and rec-
ognizing the limits it imposes are crucial. For example, if the project calls for the
analysis of a decided case such as Morrison v. Jenkins (page 31), the data available for
analysis are ﬁxed. Nothing can be added. The role of the analyst is analogous to the
role of a historian. In this context, all the evidence has been collected. The exercise
then is to analyze a given mixed mass of evidence that constitutes the data upon
which the decision was based in light of a declared ultimate probandum. If this
standpoint is adopted, the natural next step is to compile a key-list. This involves
identifying, formulating, and ordering the reported propositions that are relevant
to the ultimate probandum or probanda as given, as well as any unstated inferential
propositions necessary to demonstrate the relevance of each reported proposition.
If the standpoint is that of an advocate, however, the problem of selection must
be addressed. Selection implies a given collection of pre-existing propositions from
which one chooses those that are relevant. But even where there is a ﬁnite body of
materialforanalysis,suchasapre-trialcollectionofdepositionsanddocuments,the
propositions are not already there, lined up like candidates on parade. A complex
processofextracting,individuating,andmakingexplicitstatementsinpropositional
form is involved, allowing considerable scope for both choice and creativity. To be
sure,theremaybestatementsintherecordthatmaybeliftedverbatimintoakey-list,
but these are likely to be exceptional.
Selection also requires more than sorting out the relevant from the irrelevant.
A proposition is relevant if it has some probative connection with an ultimate
probandum, that is, it tends to support, tends to negate, or tends to explain that
probandum either directly or indirectly. Relevance is a necessary condition for
inclusionofanevidentialpropositiononakey-list,butitisnotasufﬁcientcondition.
There is an almost inﬁnite possibility of regress and of more and more minute
analysis of any body of evidentiary materials. Inclusion in a key-list inevitably
involves making judgments of importance (non-triviality) that go beyond mere
theoretical relevance. Wigmore’s Science does not, and probably could not, provide
a clear set of criteria of importance. The importance criterion is simple to state, but
difﬁcult to apply. The ﬁnal product must include all, but only, those propositions
that are important in light of the theory of the case the advocate has adopted and the
theory that she anticipates opposing counsel will adopt. Again, in the preliminary
stages, caution must be exercised: Weeding is easier than inserting.

The chart method
131
It is often difﬁcult to judge whether to include generalizations on the key-list.
For example, it would clutter the key-list and obscure the argument if every gen-
eralization that serves as a warrant for an inference is included in the key-list. For
example, the proposition that X testiﬁed to Y tends to support Y because of the
generalization, “Testimonial evidence is usually true.” These and other common
generalizations are usually left unstated.
Ontheotherhand,anargumentoritsstrengthmaydependuponageneralization
that is not obvious and that may be disputed. For example, in “The Nine Mile Walk”
(pages 11–17), Welt asserts, “An inference can be logical and still not be true . . . Give
meanysentenceoftenortwelvewords,andI’llbuildyoualogicalchainofinferences
that you never dreamed of when you framed the sentence.” Kemelman challenges
Welt with the sentence, “A nine mile walk is no joke, especially in the rain.” Later
in the story when it appears Welt’s inferences may be true as well as logical, he asks
Kemelman, “Where did you get that sentence?” Kemelman responds, “It was just
a sentence. It simply popped into my head.” Welt immediately argues, “It couldn’t
have! It’s not the sort of sentence that pops into one’s head.” Welt’s argument
depends upon an experience-based generalization that was not apparent until he
explained it: “If you had taught composition as long as I have, you’d know that when
you ask someone for a sentence of ten words or so, you get an ordinary statement
such as ‘I like milk’ – with the other words made up by a modifying clause like,
‘because it is good for my health.’ The sentence you offered related to a particular
situation.”
One value of the chart method is that it enables the analyst to make explicit what
is normally left implicit. Because of the dangers and uncertainties surrounding
generalizations in the context of argumentation, it is good discipline to articulate
at least those generalizations that may play a signiﬁcant role in the argument and
that are not obvious or are vulnerable to attack.5
d. Ordering the propositions on the key-list. The propositions on the ﬁnal key-list
should be ordered, to the extent feasible, so that the structure of the argument is
apparent on its face. The easiest type of key-list for the reader to use is one that
presents the propositions in a form that conforms to the outline method of analysis
(discussed in Chapter 6, below). The penultimate probanda are the main headings,
and the supporting propositions are organized in a way that outlines the argument
under that heading.
This is not always feasible and, in some cases, it may facilitate the analyst’s work
to adopt other organizing principles. For example, some analysts prefer to ﬁrst
extract and individuate all of the evidential propositions onto the key-list before
beginning to identify the inferential propositions necessary to demonstrate their
relationships to the penultimate probanda (or to credibility). Clearly, if the chart is
the end product, there is no logical necessity for order within the key-list: The chart
deﬁnes the order. But practically, reading the key-list and working through a chart
5 Huddleston provides another illuminating example. See Chapter 1 at page 19 above.

Analysis of Evidence
are both enhanced if the propositions on the list are ordered logically. Common
sense, taking into account the purpose of the effort and the needs of the audience,
is likely to be a safe guide.
Step 6. Preparing the chart(s). The end products are the chart and the key-list. The
actual mechanics required to draw a chart are always laborious. They are especially
laborious in one’s ﬁrst attempts. The struggle is not only with the logic, but also
with recalling the correct symbols and laying it all out on paper. Based upon our
experiences and those of our students, we offer some suggestions that may aid those
embarking on a project for the ﬁrst time.
a After clarifying your standpoint, always start by charting the ultimate and
penultimate probanda and work “down” as far as your provisional theory allows. This
will serve several purposes: It will help you to visualize the structure of the case; it will
let you plan the space allocations for the chart or charts; and it may show you ways of
reorganizing parts of your key-list. (The macroscopic chart of Able above at page 128
provides a simple example.)
b Break the chart into sectors, and complete one sector at a time. If the evidential
propositions related to a particular penultimate probandum seem manageable in
number, chart them ﬁrst. Do the charting in “sector charts” on separate sheets of
81/2′′ × 11′′ paper6 and then identify these sector charts on a chart of your ultimate
and penultimate probanda. For example, in the Simpson case, the lawyers might have
charted the propositions bearing on opportunity as one sector. In the macroscopic
charting of the ultimate and penultimate probanda, under proposition 3, “It was OJS
who committed the act that caused NBS’s death,” the analyst would have had, as one
of the principal supports, the proposition, “OJS had an opportunity to commit the act
that caused NBS’s death.” Under the symbol for that proposition, the analyst might
have put “See chart B.” It is annoying to see a new relationship or possibility after you
have charted ﬁfteen propositions in a sector; it is devastating to encounter the same
problem after you have charted 150 propositions on a single sheet of paper. Moreover,
the ﬁnal product is easier to work with (and store) if it ﬁts in a binder or standard ﬁle.
c Do not assume that an autoptic proference or a proposition will appear only once in
the chart. A logic chart is not a jigsaw puzzle in which each piece ﬁts in only one place.
Do not assume that a piece of evidence supports only one inference. For example, the
prior tax returns in United States v. Able not only support inferences about how much
money he made as a partner in a law ﬁrm, but also support an important defense
inference – Able regularly relied upon accountants to prepare his income tax returns.7
d At every stage, check that each inferential relationship charted involves a genuine
inference. The best test is to ask whether the claimed inference is necessary to address
6 Most students draw their draft chart by hand, and those who are not comfortable with computer
drawing must draw their ﬁnal charts in the same way. There are standard logic templates that
have the necessary symbols. Using protractors with 81/2′′ × 11′′ graph paper facilitates the manual
drawing process.
7 The use of the same proposition to support different parts of an argument creates a signiﬁcant risk
of “circularity,” as illustrated by the analysis of Huddleston. See Anderson (1999) 468.

a real doubt. This step is critical. The function of the chart is to enable the preparer
and the audience to spot ﬂaws not previously apparent in the analysis and to enable
the advocate to correct or emphasize the ﬂaw.
e Detect and avoid common charting errors. It is important to remember that an
argument is different from a chronological table or a story. The relations between
propositions on a key-list in logical analysis are based upon relevance: propositions
tend to support or tend to negate other propositions. A common error in microscopic
analysis is using propositions to tell a story in terms of temporal relations (“and then,”
“and then” . . . ) or causal relations (“x happened because y happened”). Such errors
can easily be detected when the propositions are charted. They are often depicted as a
“string of pearls” all supporting a single proposition. On a chart, there is a single node
with ﬁve or ten nodes depicted as each providing independent support for that node.
If ten witnesses assert they saw X enter Y’s house at 4:15 p.m., the relationships are
correctly depicted. Otherwise the string indicates a problem. Alternatively, they are
depicted as a vertical string of pearls – e.g., a single testimonial assertion supporting a
catenate chain of ﬁve or more inferential steps supporting a single conclusion. Again,
it is possible to have that many nodes in a chain, but it is so rare as to excite immediate
suspicion.8
Step 7. Reﬁning and completing the analysis. The chart and key-list are means not
ends. As a guide to work, the ﬁrst ﬁve steps have proven useful in practice. But
at each step the judgments made and the analysis were necessarily tentative. The
end is to develop a logically sound analysis that, in light of the analyzer’s speciﬁc
objectives, organizes a mass of evidence and charts the inferences necessary to relate
allsigniﬁcantrelevantdatatotheultimatepropositioninissue.Typically,theprocess
of revision and reﬁnement is continuous, with judgments previously made being
revised in each succeeding step of the analysis. But the chart and key-list completed
through step 6 provide the ﬁrst real opportunity for analyzing and evaluating the
case-as-a-whole and testing the judgments initially made. This is where the true
value of the analysis as both intellectual exercise and practical work emerges most
clearly. For that reason, the analysis of the whole should be done as a separate
step.
Time permitting, this step should not be undertaken immediately and, in prac-
tice, should ordinarily be a collegial activity. Lay the record, the key-list, and the
chart aside for a few days. Ask a fellow student or a partner to read the record, the
key-list, and the chart to see if he or she can follow it, attack it, offer fresh insights.
Then, using the ﬁrst six steps as a guide, work through the materials and reﬁne or
adjust the key-list and chart as necessary.
For the trial lawyer, this is obviously and necessarily a continuous process. The
early phases of an investigation have suggested a tentative theory: The available
evidence, in light of established legal principles, suggests a plausible theory by
which a desirable ultimate proposition might be proven. But new supporting and
8 Other common errors are described and illustrated at the Analysis website.

Analysis of Evidence
conﬂicting data will be added, and the analysis and theory must be continuously
revised. Indeed, the key-list and chart that the lawyer used in preparing for trial
must be ﬁnally reviewed and revised in light of the evidence actually admitted
and excluded during the course of the trial in order to prepare for closing argu-
ment. The utility of the key-list and chart, in that context, is that it makes it
possible for the lawyer to see immediately the effect of the evidence unexpect-
edly admitted or excluded on the theory of the case as previously developed and
charted.
The ﬁnal step should produce a product that accounts for all the signiﬁcant
relevant data that are available and that precisely and clearly identiﬁes the logical
organization and inferences necessary to relate those data to the ultimate proban-
dum. In the aggregate, it establishes and makes available for critical review the
lawyer’s theory of the case and in practice it provides the foundation for preparing
and executing the next task in the case at hand.
C. The symbols and their use
Wigmore’s chart method employs a system of symbols speciﬁcally designed to make
it feasible to depict the evidence and arguments that bear upon the material facts
in a legal dispute in graphic form. In this section, we ﬁrst present the symbols and
discuss their use. We then address the question: Do the beneﬁts justify the effort?
1. The basic Wigmorean palette9
The modiﬁed Wigmorean charting system or palette presented in this book requires
only eight symbols. Five are likely to be required for any chart:
the square for depicting testimonial assertions;
⃝
the circle for depicting circumstantial evidence or inferred propositions;
>
the open angle to identify an argument that provides an alternative
explanation for an inference proposed by the other side;
◁
a vertical triangle to identify an argument that corroborates a proposed
inference;
↑
←
a line to indicate the “direction” of a proposed inferential relationship
between or among propositions – a vertical line indicates “tends to
support”; horizontal lines indicate “tends to negate or weaken.” The
direction from evidential data to asserted inferences is always up, from
bottom to top. Directional arrows are only occasionally necessary where
the line standing alone might be misunderstood.10
9 We use the term “palette” as it has been adopted in computer jargon. Programs now exist for
constructing charts by using a speciﬁed palette of symbols, such as the basic Wigmorean palette
described in this section. See note 14 below and references cited there.
10 Each of these is a standard logic symbol that can be drawn using commercially available plastic
templates.

The chart method
135
The nature of a judicial trial makes it necessary to have symbols to identify the
kinds of evidential data or the source of the propositions the tribunal will be asked
to take as the basis for the arguments advanced. Wigmore speciﬁed two, and we
have found a third useful:
∞
(6) an inﬁnity symbol to identify testimonial assertions that the fact ﬁnd-
ers will hear or other autoptic proferences they will perceive with their
other senses;
¶
(7) a paragraph symbol to identify facts the tribunal will judicially notice
or otherwise accept without evidential support; and
G
(8) the letter “G” to denote a generalization that is likely to play a signif-
icant role in an argument in a case, but that is not a proposition that
will be supported by evidence or that the tribunal will be formally
asked to notice judicially.
These symbols satisfy the three conditions necessary for a chart method. First,
the system makes it possible to distinguish between the principal types of evidential
datathatwillbepresentedtothetribunal–testimonialassertions,tangibleevidence,
and judicially noticed facts – and to identify generalizations upon which particular
arguments depend.
Second, the system makes it possible to chart the ﬁve different probative processes
(above pages 94–98) involved in adjudicated cases. Proponent’s assertion can be
depicted by the use of lines to depict the relationships between a probans and the
probandum that the proponent claims it supports. The opponent’s explanation can
be depicted by the use of the open angle, to chart the data or generalizations offered
to support a proposition that provides an alternative explanation for a proponent’s
assertion. The opponent’s denial and the opponent’s rival can be depicted by the use
of squares and circles to depict the opponent’s argument and the use of a line and
directional arrow to depict the claim that they combine to support a proposition
that detracts from the related proponent’s assertion – that is, the use of a directional
arrow,pointingawayfromtheproponent’sassertionandtowardtherivalornegative
proposition the opponent has advanced.
Although rare, the distinction between “proponent’s corroboration,” as a proba-
tive process, and “corroboration,” as a logical structure, can sometimes be impor-
tant to an advocate preparing for trial or an analyst concerned with showing at
what stages evidence was introduced at trial. In that context, an additional sym-
bol to identify the proponent’s corroboration as a separate probative process is
useful. This may be done by the use of a vertical triangle connected by a line (with
or without a directional arrow) to the proponent’s assertion that it reinforces to
show the context in which the evidential data reinforcing the proponent’s claim
were or will be presented. This additional symbol makes it possible to distinguish
between the principal support for a proponent’s assertion and the corroborating
support available if, and perhaps admissible only if, the opponent challenges that
assertion.

Analysis of Evidence
Finally, the use of lines and directional arrows makes it possible to identify the
steps and inferential relationships in an argument in which it is claimed that propo-
sitions are logically related – that is, to depict what Wigmore called the probative
relations among evidential data and circumstantial propositions in a case and to
presentachart(orseriesofcharts)showingtheserelationshipsforacase-as-a-whole.
If the analyst stipulated that the direction of the inferential relationships depicted
is upward unless otherwise indicated then directional arrows are only necessary for
identifying rival or denial propositions. See chart 5.2 below.
2. The chart method illustrated
These eight symbols are sufﬁcient to construct a chart that depicts the possible argu-
mentsinacase.Thatpointisillustratedbythekey-listandchartthatfollow.Thekey-
list takes the propositions from “An investigation” (above, page 40) that were used
to illustrate different logical structures typically involved in making inferences and
adds some additional propositions for the defense. The ultimate probandum in the
case remains, “It was X who murdered Y.” The key-list and chart were prepared from
the standpoint of a lawyer early in the investigation trying to identify and analyze
the arguments that might be made from the available evidential data to support the
intermediate probandum, “X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m. on January 1” – the
time and place of the alleged murder of Y. The chart illustrates how these basic
symbols might be employed to depict arguments that could be made, based upon
the available data and how the different probative processes might be depicted
within a single chart. The key-list and chart will also lay the foundation for some
additional points developed below.
Two points merit immediate note. First, the arguments developed in the key-
list and depicted in the chart represent only one approach that the prosecutor
might have taken. For example, she might have decided (and might still decide)
that W2 should be called before W1, so that the convergent testimony might be
juxtaposed as support for P2 without holding W2 in reserve until W1 had been
impeached. Similarly, she might have identiﬁed other generalizations she thought
more signiﬁcant.
Second, the example in Figure 5.2 presents a simple key-list and a chart that
ﬁts comfortably on a single page. In a more complex case, it would ordinarily be
necessary to divide the argument into sectors and then to chart the sectors on dif-
ferent sheets of paper. For example, it is often useful to chart credibility separately.
If that is done, the chart of the propositions bearing upon a witness’s credibil-
ity would culminate in one proposition (or in some cases, two) expressing the
analyst’s judgment as to the impact on the witness’s credibility. In the credibil-
ity chart, the analyst would insert an open angle (if the analysis undermines the
witness’s credibility). If there is evidence reinforcing the witness’s credibility or
undermining the attack, the analyst would insert a vertical triangle (if there is evi-
dence that reinforces credibility) or a further open angle (if there are generalizations
or evidential data that can be marshaled to undermine the attack on the witness’s

credibility). In such a case, only the open angle(s) and the vertical triangle would
be appended to the credibility node for each assertion the witness makes with a
reference to the sector chart, e.g., “see chart 15,” where the micro credibility analysis
is depicted.
Partial key-list for “Preliminary opportunity chart”
1 Y is dead; and Y died as a result of an unlawful act; and it was X who committed the act
that caused Y’s death; and X acted with malice aforethought in committing the act.
2 Y is dead.
3 Y died as a result of an unlawful act.
4 It was X who committed the act that caused Y’s death.
5 X acted with malice aforethought in committing the act.
6 X had an opportunity to commit the act that caused Y’s death.
7 X had a motive to murder Y.
8 There is other evidence support proposition 4.
9 Y was murdered in his home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1.
10 W1 will testify, “I saw a person with characteristics a, b, c, and d enter Y’s house at
4:15 p.m. on January 1.”
11 W1 saw a person with characteristics a, b, c, and d enter Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on
January 1.
12 A person with characteristics a, b, c, and d entered Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1.
13 X has characteristics a, b, c, and d.
14 Characteristics a, b, c, and d were as follows: a. white hair; b. approximate height of
ﬁve feet; c. a pronounced limp; d. the wearing of a cheap brown coat.
15 G: Few people walk with a pronounced limp.
16 It was X who entered Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1.
17 People who enter or leave a house usually remain or have been in that house for at
least ﬁfteen minutes.
18 It may have been someone other than X, who had characteristics similar to X’s, who
entered Y’s house at 4:15 p.m.
19 W2 will testify, “I know X.”
20 W2 knows X.
21 W2 will testify, “I saw X leave Y’s home at 4:45 p.m. on January 1.”
22 W2 saw X leave Y’s home at 4:45 p.m.
23 X left Y’s house at 4:45 p.m.
24 X was in Y’s home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1.
25 X will testify, “I was in a house ﬁve miles from the scene of the murder between
2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on January 1.”
26 X was in a house ﬁve miles from Y’s house between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on January 1.
27 Z will testify, “I was with X in a house ﬁve miles from Y’s house between 4 p.m. and
4:24 p.m. on January 1.”
28 Z was with X in a house ﬁve miles from Y’s house between 4 p.m. and 4:24 p.m. on
January 1.
29 X was not in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m. on January 1.

Analysis of Evidence
30 ¶: It gets dark after 4:00 p.m. on January 1.
31 W1’s observational sensitivity may have been impaired.
32 At an identiﬁcation parade (line-up) held three days after the murder, W1 failed to
identify X.
33 A recent report of empirical research on eyewitness evidence suggests that eyewitness
statements reporting identifying characteristics of a suspect made in circumstances
approximating those under which W1 observed a person entering Y’s home
(proposition 2) are 100 percent correct in only 5 percent of the cases.
34 W1’s memory and objectivity are open to question.
35 W1 seemed to be very nervous and hesitant when questioned by the police.
36 G: People who are very nervous when they are being questioned by the police may
not be sure that their statements are true.
37 G: It is normal to be very nervous when being questioned by the police about a
serious crime.
38 W1’s veracity may be questioned.
39 The credibility of W1’s identiﬁcation of the person who entered Y’s house is open to
serious question.
40 W1 is telling the truth as he recalls it.
41 W1 is a bank manager.
42 G: Bank managers are almost always truthful.
43 G: Most people would notice and recall that a person they had seen walked with a
pronounced limp.
44 It is highly probable that W1 did see a person with characteristics a, b, c, and d enter
Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1.
45 W2 is very short-sighted.
46 W2’s observational sensitivity may have been impaired.
47 W2 knew that X regularly visited Y’s house.
48 Y was X’s son.
49 W2 is Y’s brother.
50 X is also W2’s mother.
51 G: It is probable that a brother would know about regular visits between his mother
and his brother.
52 G: When someone sees a person, who has the characteristics of a person known to be
a regular visitor, leave a house, he or she is likely to conclude that the person leaving
is the person known to be a regular visitor.
53 W2’s expectations (objectivity bias) may have caused him to misidentify the person
he saw leave Y’s house at 4:45 p.m.
54 W2 stands to beneﬁt ﬁnancially from Y’s death.
55 G: A mother is usually a beneﬁciary of her son’s estate.
56 X is probably a beneﬁciary of Y’s estate.
57 G: Persons who are convicted of murder cannot receive any part of the victim’s estate.
58 The beneﬁt to W2 would probably increase if X were convicted of Y’s murder.
59 W2 has a motive to lie.
60 W2’s veracity is open to doubt.
61 W2’s identiﬁcation of Y is open to serious challenge.

Figure 5.2 Key-list and chart (“An investigation”)
The speciﬁed procedures are designed to enhance the rigor and enable the
“charter” to see possibilities and problems that otherwise might have passed unno-
ticed. The resulting product makes it possible for others, as well as the “charter,” to
provide rigorous critique and appraisal of the arguments advanced. But the pro-
cedures and the charting systems can only complement, never substitute for, the
intellectual skill and judgment of the lawyer.
Exercise
1 You are the young prosecutor charged with presenting the government’s case in Able.
Review the case ﬁle (at pages 24–27). Analyze Able’s credibility, using the attributes of
credibility presented in Figure 2.7 (above at page 68) and prepare an organized list of

Analysis of Evidence
the questions you ask Able on cross-examination to focus the jury’s attention on the
identiﬁed bases for doubting all of the important testimonial assertions you anticipate
that Able will make during his direct examination, if he takes the stand.
2 Switch: You are the defense attorney who will represent Able at trial. You have done
the same analysis and have identiﬁed questions you think a competent prosecutor
would ask. How would you suggest Able respond to each question? Are there any
opponent’s explanations you could offer to undermine any of the points developed by
the prosecutor’s attack? Is there evidence you might present that would reinforce
Able’s credibility? If so, prepare a key-list and chart the propositions identiﬁed. On
that basis, prepare an organized list of the questions you would ask on redirect and
specify the witnesses you might call to reinforce the credibility of his assertions.
3. Additional symbols, conventions and their utility
The key-list and chart presented above provide a foundation for appraising the
utility of other symbols and conventions that might be used in charting a particular
problem. The utility of additional symbols and conventions is largely a function of
the objectives of the person applying the method and of the characteristics of the
particular problem. We have identiﬁed further symbols and reﬁnements that have
proven useful when the standpoint is that of a lawyer preparing for trial. We discuss
speciﬁc symbols and other conventions and appraise their utility in the paragraphs
that follow.
There are three symbols that are frequently useful to the lawyer conducting an
analysis in preparation for trial. As a practical matter, facts are often stipulated to be
true by the parties (“S”); admitted by the pleadings (“A”); or not subject to genuine
dispute (“U”). They should, however, be employed with caution and precision.
Stipulated and admitted facts ordinarily can and must be formally introduced and
published at trial, albeit without testimony or other autoptic proference. Facts that
are not subject to dispute must nevertheless be supported by admissible evidence
unless they have been established by formal admission or stipulation. Precision is
necessary to ensure that those who might rely on the chart in preparing for trial are
not misled.
Every case will differ. The standard conventions may often need to be supple-
mented or adapted by case-speciﬁc conventions in a complex case. For example,
in cases in which questionable hearsay or propensity evidence has been or may be
admitted, two additional conventions may be useful. First, hearsay can be depicted
byplacingasquareinsidethecircledepictinganout-of-courtassertionthedeclarant
allegedly made. So too, if there is or was a dispute over the admissibility of certain
evidential data it is often useful to shade or color code the evidential data and the
inferences to be derived from those data so that the actual or potential effect of that
evidence may readily be identiﬁed.11 Indeed, in some cases there may be more than
11 See, e.g., Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284 (1973) and Crawford v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 1354
(2004) (cases in which the admissibility of hearsay evidence was the central issue).

one kind of evidential data whose admissibility or use could be challenged, such as
a case involving both hearsay and propensity evidence that was or may be offered,12
or cases in which the same kind of evidence may be challenged on different grounds,
such as a case involving more than one witness testifying to an out-of-court asser-
tion in which different exceptions to the hearsay rule may apply.13 In such cases,
multiple colors or shadings may be useful.
Students embarking on the construction of a chart should realize that the stan-
dard conventions for the charting system may have to be modiﬁed or supplemented
for the particular chart. But they should also recognize that it is important to
articulate precisely any modiﬁed or special conventions adopted, so that others
familiar with the standard conventions may understand and appraise the prod-
uct. As in bridge, special conventions are likely to cause trouble unless they are
understood by your partner.
To achieve the latter objective, we advise students to begin with the simpliﬁed
Wigmorean eight-symbol system or palette described above and to explain carefully
anyadditionalsymbolsorconventionstheyadoptinconstructingaparticularchart.
The particular advantages of that system are three. The system was speciﬁcally
designed for charting the evidence in a legal dispute. The system employs symbols
that can be constructed with standard logic templates that are readily available.
Moreover and more important, computer software for the construction of charts
using this system has already been developed and will be further reﬁned in the
future.14
4. Three advantages of symbols and charting
Like other symbol systems, the chart method imposes a barrier to those who would
use it. They must ﬁrst master the symbols and their deﬁnitions and the protocols
speciﬁed for their use. Mastering such a system is hard work. This poses a question
that has thus far only been partly addressed: Are there signiﬁcant advantages that
can be realized by the use of symbols to chart the evidence and arguments in a legal
dispute that cannot be as easily achieved by other means? The answer is, in our view,
a ﬁrm “Yes.” We develop the basis for this view below.
The chart method, described above, has three essential advantages. First, it
requiresthepersondoingtheanalysistoidentifyandarticulatepreciselyeachpropo-
sition that she claims is a necessary step in the arguments in a case. The value to
be achieved is precision. Second, the method requires that the person employing

an improperly prejudicial propensity effect offered to question the credibility of a witness).
13 See Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150 (1995) (a case involving hearsay statements from the same
declarant offered through different witnesses, where the potential exception depended upon the
status of the witness).
