Analysis of Evidence
E did actually occur? Unless evidence E∗is perfectly credible, it would be a mistake
to equate E∗and E. Having evidence that E occurred does not entail that E did in
fact occur.
There are two forms of evidence that may be relevant in a legal dispute –
tangible evidence and testimonial evidence. The attributes that must be consid-
ered in assessing the credibility of each form differ.15 Credibility involves more than
one dimension or attribute regardless of what kind of evidence we are considering,
but the speciﬁc attributes of credibility depend upon what kind of evidence we are
considering. Attributes of the credibility of testimonial evidence are quite different
from the attributes of the credibility of tangible evidence.
a. Tangible evidence
There are many forms of tangible evidence including objects, documents, sensor
images, measurements, and a variety of representations such as charts, maps, and
diagrams. All of these kinds of tangible evidence are open to inspection. What they
actually reveal in a particular situation is not always obvious.16 The trouble is that
tangible evidence is not always what it seems to be. Documents can be forged,
currency counterfeited, images labeled incorrectly, samples of blood mixed up,
and drugs planted on persons. There are three important attributes that must be
considered in assessing the credibility of tangible evidence.
i. Authenticity. Authenticity is the most important element of the credibility of
tangible evidence. In law, the party seeking to introduce a document, photograph,
or another item of tangible evidence must offer evidence “sufﬁcient to support
a ﬁnding that it is what it purports to be” (Federal Rule of Evidence 901). To
be admissible it must purport to be something that is relevant to a penultimate
probandum or to the credibility of other evidence in the case.
There are three major sources of ancillary evidence that may call into question
the authenticity of tangible evidence. The ﬁrst involves evidence that has been delib-
erately contrived in order to mislead others such as a forged document. Errors in
recording, transmitting, or processing evidence is the second source. Tangible evi-
dence may pass through many hands before it is offered at trial. The opportunities
for processing or handling errors of various kinds increases with the number of
hands a tangible item passes through. Blood samples may be mislabeled or even
15 In many contexts including law, the word “reliability” is often used synonymously for the term
“credibility.” The difﬁculty is that the term “reliability” has a much more restricted meaning than
does the term “credibility.” A process of some sort is reliable to the extent that it is consistent,
repeatable, or dependable. Thus, you believe your car is reliable to the extent that it will continue
to take you where you want to go for some speciﬁed time in the future.
16 In many cases, the decision-maker must rely upon the opinions of experts to tell her what event(s)
a tangible item reveals. For example, a ballistics expert may express an opinion identifying the
weapon from which a bullet was ﬁred and explain how the markings on the bullet enabled him
to form that opinion. Experts can be wrong in their interpretation of what event(s) a tangible
item reveals. It is the bullet that is tangible evidence; the expert’s opinion comes in the form
of testimonial assertions whose credibility can only be assessed by reference to the credibility
attributes of testimonial evidence. See below at pp. 65–67.

substituted one for another. That is the reason for the requirement that there should
be evidence establishing the chain of custody from the time the evidence was dis-
covered (the bloody glove) or generated (an entry into a business record) until the
time the evidence is presented at trial. If we do not know all of the links in a chain of
custody, we cannot vouch for the authenticity of a tangible item. Finally, the witness
whose testimony is offered to establish the authenticity of an item may be mistaken
or untruthful.
ii. Accuracy/Sensitivity. Sensing devices of all sorts can supply tangible evidence
in the form of images such as photographs and other sensor records. The credibility
issue here concerns whether a sensing device provides the degree of resolution
necessary for us to discriminate among possible events that may be recorded on
the image. In some instances the accuracy of a sensing device can be degraded by
inappropriatesettingsofthedevice’scontrols.Forexample,ifacameraisnotfocused
properly,thentheimageobtainedmaybeblurred.Insuchcaseswemaynotbeableto
tell whether the photo does in fact show person X, as the proponent of this evidence
claims. Courts admit business records as an exception to the hearsay rule only if
the witness who identiﬁes them knows enough about the process for recording the
data on which they were based, the process by which they were generated, and how
they were stored to enable the other party, through cross-examination, to identify
ﬂaws that might undermine the accuracy of the information they contain. This
issue of accuracy also applies to demonstrative evidence, such as statistical analyses,
results of which can be displayed in graphic or pictorial form. Every student of
elementary statistics learns how easy it is to construct inaccurate and misleading
graphic accounts of the results of statistical analysis.
iii. Reliability. A reliable process is one that is repeatable, dependable or consis-
tent. For some kinds of tangible evidence, reliability refers to the operating charac-
teristics of the device used to generate it. Such a device is reliable only if it gives the
same reading or image on repeated applications of the device. No sensing device
can provide reliable readings if the device is not properly maintained. For example,
a police radar gun cannot be expected to provide reliable indications of a car’s speed
if it has not been serviced regularly or if it has been dropped on several occasions.
Replicable or repeatable processes form the basis for all statistical analyses. The term
“reliability” in statistical analysis refers to the extent of measurement error that is
naturally associated with any statistical estimate.
b. The credibility of testimonial evidence
i. The basis for a testimonial assertion. An investigator or a lawyer must consider how
the witness acquired the data upon which her testimonial assertion is based. The
witness may have acquired the data from one or a combination of three sources. For
example, person P tells us that event E occurred, and we ask the natural question:
How do you know that E happened? P can give one of three possible answers. First,
she may say, “I observed the occurrence of E for myself.” P is claiming personal
knowledge of the occurrence of event E.

Analysis of Evidence
Second, she may say: “I did not observe event E myself, but I learned about
its occurrence from person Q.” In other words, P obtained information about the
occurrence of event E at second hand from another person Q. In fact, however, the
information obtained by P might have come through sources in addition to person
Q. For example, we might ask Q how she obtained information about event E,
and she might respond: “I heard about it from person R.” If we cannot question
R or otherwise discover the primary source of information about event E, then P’s
testimony has no better status than rumor or gossip. P’s testimony in this case is
hearsay. Whether or not such evidence would be admitted at trial depends on the
rules regulating the admissibility and use of hearsay evidence. But hearsay evidence
is often valuable evidence in advancing fact investigation, even when such evidence
might not be admissible later at trial.
Third, P might say: “I did not observe E myself. However, I observed two other
events C and D from which I inferred that event E also occurred.” This is opinion
evidence, not based on any personal knowledge of event E. The legal requirement
that a witness have personal knowledge of events upon which her testimony is based
addresses the primary difﬁculty such opinion evidence poses. The witness ought to
tell the decision-maker that she observed C and D so that the decision-maker can
decide whether those observations justify an inference that E occurred.17
ii. The credibility attributes of a testimonial assertion. Assessing the credibility
of any testimonial assertion requires consideration of three attributes: veracity,
objectivity, and observational sensitivity.
The term “veracity” has caused many difﬁculties in studies of witness credibility.
Suppose witness W tells us that event E occurred and we later discover that it did
not occur. This must mean that we now have conclusive evidence that event E did
not occur. Question: Was W lying to us in his testimony? The correct answer to
this question is: “Not necessarily.” Witness W might simply have been mistaken in
his observation, or was not objective in forming his beliefs. So, a person is being
untruthful in testimony only if this person testiﬁes against his/her beliefs. We must
be sure that challenges to a witness’s credibility are based on the correct forms of
ancillary evidence. For example, evidence that a witness has poor eyesight is not a
challenge to the witness’s veracity.
Now consider the objectivity attribute. Suppose we believe that witness W is
testifying in accordance with her beliefs. She testiﬁes E∗, that event E occurred,
and she ﬁrmly believes that event E did occur. Now the question is: On what basis
did she form this belief? Did she form this belief based on accurate and objective
17 In some circumstances, a witness may be permitted to express an opinion, lay or expert, because
that is the best or only way the decision-maker can understand the evidence. A lay person might
testify, “Harold was sad when the boss ﬁred him,” without providing a detailed description of
facial expression and behavior that led her to conclude he was sad. A qualiﬁed expert might testify,
“Based upon a comparison of the DNA in the blood found at the scene and the accused’s DNA, it
is almost certain that the blood at the scene was the accused’s blood,” because a non-expert would
be unable to understand or interpret the data upon which the expert’s opinion was based.

understanding of her sensory evidence, or did she form it on the basis of what she
either expected or wanted to occur? An illustration: We are all, on occasion, liable
to believe what we either expect or hope will occur regardless of what our senses tell
us. By deﬁnition, an objective observer is one who forms a belief based on evidence
rather than on surmise [expectations] or on desires.
Suppose we now believe that witness W’s belief about event E was formed objec-
tively on the basis of sensory evidence. The next question is: How good was this
sensory evidence? So, we now come to the credibility attribute we have labeled
“observational sensitivity.” There is much more to this attribute than just consider-
ing the adequacy of a witness’s sensory systems: vision, hearing, touch, smell, and
taste. Of course it is true that a person may be mistaken in testimony if his visual
acuity was poor, and uncorrected, at the time of an observation. But a witness hav-
ing very acute sensory powers under normal circumstances may still obtain faulty
sensory evidence.
Much depends on a witness’s general physical condition at the time of an obser-
vation. If the person was intoxicated, or under the inﬂuence of some narcotic or
other chemical substance, we cannot expect this person to make full use of her
sensory capabilities. Another general consideration concerns the conditions under
which an observation was made. A person having even very acute visual capabilities
would not be able to exploit these capabilities under very low levels of illumination.
Nor would a person with very acute hearing be able to recognize the content of
speech uttered in the presence of strong background noise.
c. Ancillary evidence about testimonial credibility attributes
What is so often overlooked is that the three credibility attributes of ordinary wit-
nesses just discussed are both time and context dependent. For example, witness
W might well have been more objective in observations regarding event A than he
would have been in observations about event B. Our sensory systems are known
to vary in their sensitivity over time. Fortunately, or unfortunately, no one keeps
statistical records regarding our veracity, objectivity, and observational sensitivity
that might subsequently be used if we show up as witnesses in a legal dispute. To
substitute for a lack of any statistical evidence regarding these attributes we sub-
stitute a variety of different items of evidence we may have about a person that
may serve as ancillary evidence regarding attributes of the credibility of ordinary
witnesses.
There is no discipline outside of law in which a more extensive effort has been
made to record various grounds for impeaching or supporting witness credibility.
Figure 2.7 identiﬁes grounds for impeaching and supporting witness credibility
that have been compiled over the ages. Each item listed is a form of ancillary
evidence bearing upon the credibility of ordinary witnesses, but only some, not
all, of these forms of ancillary evidence can be uniquely associated with one of the
three credibility attributes we have just discussed.

Analysis of Evidence
Figure 2.7 Ancillary evidence concerning attributes of witness credibility
FirstconsiderthecolumninFigure2.7labeled“Speciﬁc.”Hereareformsofancil-
lary evidence that can be associated speciﬁcally with one of the credibility attributes:
veracity, objectivity, and observational sensitivity. We have already discussed some
of these forms of evidence, but not all of them. In the case of observational sensitiv-
ity we must be concerned about the quality and duration of a witness’s observation.
Did the witness get just a brief look or did he have an opportunity to note details
during an observation? Did the witness have any personal characteristics, e.g., poor
eyesight, that might have affected her ability to make the observation accurately?
Did the witness have any area of expertise that would have allowed her to notice
certain important details that would not have been noticed by witnesses lacking
that expertise? Was the witness able to allocate full attention to what was being
observed, or was she distracted in some way during the observation? Sensory bias
refers to various ways in which our vision, hearing, and other senses might have
been biased, perhaps by clever forms of deception.
Three speciﬁc forms of ancillary evidence are listed under the objectivity
attribute. We have already mentioned how one’s expectancies may inﬂuence beliefs
as well as the various memory-related factors we discussed. Memory also affects the
objectivity of a witness’s testimony. Is there any evidence bearing upon the witness’s

69
ability to accurately recall the observations about which she was called to testify?
Objectivity bias refers to instances in which a witness may have been biased towards
believing an event occurred, or did not occur, regardless of the sensory evidence
she obtained.
Speciﬁc veracity-related evidence can involve several matters. Various forms of
prior behavior related to dishonesty are admissible under certain circumstances
as is any evidence of inﬂuence or corruption among two or more witnesses. The
demeanor and bearing of a witness while giving testimony may be relevant to her
credibility. However, not every composed witness is necessarily being truthful and
not every agitated or distraught witness is being untruthful.
Finally,thereisathirdcategoryofbiaswehavelabeledtestimonialbias.Regardless
of what a witness may believe about the occurrence of event E, this person may have
a distinct preference for revealing or not revealing what she believes. Some persons
may relish being the bearer of what they believe will be good news to one party or
the other. Other persons may have a distinct aversion to being the bearer of what
they regard as bad news for one of the parties in contention.
The second column in Figure 2.7, labeled “Less Speciﬁc,” contains classes of
ancillary evidence that may bear upon two of the credibility attributes. For example,
instructional sets of the sort mentioned earlier and an observer’s objectives may
bear upon both observational sensitivity and objectivity. Central processes in the
brain exert control over our senses. Indeed, the retinas of our eyes are extensions
of our brains. Thus the objectives for which an observation is made can inﬂuence
visual sensitivity, perhaps by increasing sensitivity. But objectives being entertained
at the time of observation may also inﬂuence the objectivity with which we form
beliefs based on the sensory evidence we obtain. We may be more “primed” to
believe one thing rather than another. In addition, any stakes, motives, or interests
in observations and testimony can inﬂuence both the objectivity with which we
form beliefs and our veracity in our testimony about these beliefs.
An important form of credibility-related ancillary evidence concerns self-
contradictions, i.e. prior inconsistent statements. A witness may tell a police ofﬁcer
immediately after some incident that event E occurred, but then later tell someone
else that event E did not occur. We cannot be sure in such instances whether these
self-contradictions involve this witness’s objectivity and memory, or whether they
indicate untruthfulness. In some instances, events interposed since an observation
may cause a person to revise a belief held earlier. The witness may simply be hon-
estly reporting a revised belief. Unfortunately, witnesses are known to “change their
stories” for other reasons involving their veracity – e.g., because they were bribed.
Finally, the two classes of ancillary evidence with question marks are simply pos-
sible forms of credibility-related ancillary evidence that would most likely not be
admissible at trial. However, they may be employed during fact investigation.
The column labeled “Unspeciﬁc” identiﬁes two of the oldest known forms of
evidence challenging credibility: contradictory and conﬂicting evidence from other
witnesses. Contradictory testimony involves events that cannot happen together;

Analysis of Evidence
i.e. they are mutually exclusive. Alibi evidence supplies an example. Joe testiﬁes that
defendant Mike was at the scene of the crime in Boston at the time the crime was
committed. Later, witness Mary testiﬁes that Mike was with her at this same time
in New York City. Mike cannot have been in both places at the same time.
Conﬂicting or divergent testimony involves testimony about different events that
may both have occurred but which favor different possibilities. As an example, we
may have evidence that Mike had the intention to commit the crime. But we may
also have evidence that Mike did not have the means to commit this crime. Here
are some reasons why contradictory and conﬂicting evidence are unspeciﬁc as far
as credibility is concerned. Suppose Mary testiﬁes that event E occurred at a certain
time. The opposition offers Paul who testiﬁes that event E did not occur at this
same time; here is a contradiction since E cannot have occurred and not occurred
at the same time. The opposition asserts that Paul has shown that Mary was being
untruthfulinhertestimony.Therearetwoproblems,theﬁrstofwhichistheobvious
fact that the credibility of both Mary and Paul is at issue. Second, suppose that Paul
is indeed correct about the nonoccurrence of event E. This hardly means that Mary
was being untruthful; she may have simply made an observational error or was not
objective in forming her beliefs based on the observation she made. The same kinds
of troubles occur when witnesses provide conﬂicting testimonies. Finally, some
forms of self-inconsistency can be linked to any of the three credibility attributes.
Onemajorpurposeofkeepingcarefultrackoftheassortedgroundsforcredibility
impeachment and support shown in Figure 2.7 is that we may hear arguments about
witness credibility that are grounded upon the wrong form of ancillary evidence.
Here are just two examples of such difﬁculties.
1 An opponent offers evidence that impeaches the objectivity of witness Mary by
showing that Mary strongly expected to observe event E. But then this opponent says:
“We have shown that Mary was not truthful in her testimony.” This conclusion does
not follow from the evidence given about Mary because she may have truthfully
reported what she believed at the time of her observation and what she believed at the
time she gave testimony. What is being challenged is Mary’s objectivity as an observer
and not her veracity in giving testimony.
2 The proponent offers a witness Joe who testiﬁes that event E occurred. The opponent
then offers another witness Walter who asserts that Joe was intoxicated at the time of
his observation. But then the opponent says: “My evidence from Walter shows that Joe
was not truthful in his testimony.” There are several troubles here, the most obvious
of which is that Joe’s alleged intoxication at the time of his observation, if true,
inﬂuences his observational sensitivity at the time of the event and not his veracity at
the time of testimony. Second, the opponent can hardly claim access to truth here
since the credibility of Walter is also at issue.

law.Synonymsfortheword“competence”include:qualiﬁed,adequate,appropriate,

or suitable. In some contexts other than law no distinction is made between the
competence and the credibility of a source of testimonial evidence. There are some
situationsinwhichthesetermsareusedsynonymously.Thisinvitesinferentialcatas-
trophe since not all competent persons are credible and not all credible persons are
competent. Competence and credibility appear to be independent characteristics.
You regard your Uncle Harold as the most honest, objective, and observationally
acute person you have ever known. But you would not solicit an opinion from Uncle
Haroldaboutagastrointestinalproblemyoucurrentlyfaceifhewasatruckdriveror
someone else not having the requisite competence to answer your question. On the
other hand, here is Mr. Smith who is regarded as an extremely competent auditor;
his opinions are often solicited by well-known industrial organizations. The trouble
is that Mr. Smith was privy to an episode of “cooking the books” in an organization,
which he later, untruthfully, denies.
In legal terms, an ordinary witness is competent if he or she was in a position to
make an observation, could understand what was being observed, and could coher-
ently recount the results of this observation. However, the credibility of a witness
concerns the extent to which her assertions can be believed. Believability depends
upon attributes concerning veracity, objectivity, and observational sensitivity.
4. On the probative force of evidence
The probative force of an item or body of evidence answers the question: “How
strong is this evidence in favoring or disfavoring some penultimate probandum
in the case at hand?” This ﬁnal major credential of evidence is in many ways the
most controversial. Though it is universally recognized that the probative force of
evidence is commonly graded in probabilistic terms, there is considerable disagree-
ment among legal scholars and probabilists about how such grading should take
place.
Any item of directly relevant evidence must be linked to a penultimate proban-
dum by a chain of inferences. This chain can contain several links. The ﬁrst link in
the chain is always the credibility link. The remaining links are those necessary to
demonstrate the relevance of the item to a penultimate probandum. The probative
force of an item depends upon the strength of each link in the chain. When there is
a mass of evidence to consider, there will be many chains of reasoning to consider.
Assessing the probative force of a mass of evidence requires that the probative force
of every chain be assessed and that the individual assessments be combined to deter-
mine the net probative value of the mass with respect to the ultimate probandum.
There are alternative ways in which the probative force of an item of evidence or of
a mass of evidence can be assessed. These are discussed in Chapters 8 and 9.
D. A substance-blind approach to evidence
Asked to say how many different kinds of evidence there are, we might be tempted to
throw up our hands and say: “The question is foolish; of course there are unlimited

Analysis of Evidence
varieties of evidence.” This would certainly be true if we were considering the
substance or content of evidence. By the substance or content of evidence we refer to
the kind of events the evidence supports. For example, an X-ray image, a spent shell
casing, a patient’s report of pain at a certain location, a passage from a contract,
and a reading from an oscilloscope all suggest the occurrence of different kinds of
events.
In fact investigation, the investigator may encounter any conceivable kind of
evidence. Investigators in the ﬁelds of law, history, and intelligence analysis must
be prepared to evaluate evidence having any conceivable substance. The problem
then is: How can we ever say anything general about evidence if it comes in so many
substantive varieties? One answer is provided if we choose to ignore its substance
and focus instead on its inferential properties. Two of the three evidence creden-
tials, relevance and credibility, supply us with a very useful scheme for classifying
evidence. This classiﬁcation scheme does allow us to say some general things about
evidence that apply regardless of the substance of the evidence.
As a fundamental basis for a substance-blind classiﬁcation of evidence that rests
only on inferential issues, we begin by considering two questions:
1 How does the user or evaluator of an item of evidence stand in relation to the
evidence? In answering this question we consider the form or type of evidence we
have. Can the user pick it up and look at it or observe it in some other way? Or, does
the evidence come from someone else who allegedly made some form of observation?
Answers to such questions suggest how we are to establish the credibility or
believability of the evidence.
2 How does the event reported in the evidence stand in relation to any probanda the
user is considering (including any ultimate or penultimate probanda)? This is a
relevance question. It is here that we must distinguish between evidence that has direct
relevance on some probandum and evidence whose relevance on a probandum is only
indirect. As we noted, in the latter case we will say that such evidence is ancillary.
Remember that ancillary evidence is either evidence about evidence or is evidence
about the strength or weakness of links in a chain of reasoning.
How any item of evidence is classiﬁed on an inferential basis is always relative to a
particular context and problem situation. An item of evidence judged to be relevant
in one inference task may not be so judged in another. Similarly, the credibility
of evidence and its sources are context-dependent. Our belief about a witness’s
credibilitymightchangeacrossdifferentcontextsinwhichthiswitnessmighttestify.
Relevance and credibility, as credentials of evidence, are not necessarily stationary.
During the course of work on some inferential matter, an analyst may have good
reasons for changing her mind about either the relevance or the credibility of an
item of evidence.

at different stages of work on a case. Finally, argument construction is a creative
act on your part. Thus, there is a natural subjective element in any classiﬁcation of
evidence. How you perceive some item of evidence in a given context might not be
so perceived by others, such as your opponent.
A substance-blind classiﬁcation of evidence, based on credibility and relevance
dimensions, is shown in Figure 2.8. Some forms of evidence we have identiﬁed
might not always be admissible in any trial. But this two-dimensional classiﬁcation
scheme has been useful in thinking about evidence in any context (law or elsewhere)
in which it might be used. In addition, you would certainly not disregard certain
evidence during fact investigation that you might not be able to get admitted at
trial. This evidence, such as objectionable hearsay statements, might have enormous
heuristic or abductive value in suggesting new hypotheses and new evidence that is
admissible.
The rows in Figure 2.8 arise when we consider how the user or evaluator stands
in relation to an item of evidence. In examining this dimension we must attend to
the physical properties of evidence, to the manner in which it came into existence,
and to the source(s) from which it was received.
First suppose the evidence is tangible in the sense that the user can in some
way examine it to determine what it reveals. In some cases the user can make such

Analysis of Evidence
a determination on her own. In other cases, however, the user might need the
assistance of an expert in order to determine what some item of tangible evidence
reveals. There are, of course, many different kinds of things we can examine for
ourselves including objects, documents, sensor images, measuring devices, and a
variety of representations such as maps, charts, diagrams, and so on. All of these
kinds of tangible evidence are open to our direct examination. What they actually
reveal in particular instances is not always immediately obvious.
The plus and minus signs under tangible evidence and under unequivocal testi-
monial evidence in Figure 2.8 are there to show that both forms of evidence have
another property that needs to be recognized. Such evidence can reveal either the
occurrence or the nonoccurrence of some event. Evidence revealing the occurrence
of some event is said to be positive evidence (+); that which reveals the nonoccur-
rence of events is said to be negative evidence (–). There are some important issues
here that bear upon the discovery or generation of evidence as well as upon the
inferential use of evidence.
There is no order of precedence between positive and negative evidence as far as
eithertheirrelevanceortheirprobativeforceareconcerned.Negativeevidence,such
as tangible or testimonial evidence about the nonoccurrence of an event, can be just
as relevant and inferentially forceful as positive evidence about the occurrence of
an event. It is common to focus on evidence regarding the occurrence of events and
easy to overlook evidence regarding the nonoccurrence of events. In any inferential
context, however, it may be as important to inquire about what did not happen as it
is to inquire about what did happen. In the mystery Silver Blaze, for example, only
Sherlock Holmes saw that the fact that the dog guarding the stable did not bark
supported an inference that the person who took the horse out of the stable was a
person with whom the dog was familiar.
Suppose that the evidence a user receives comes from another person in the form
of an assertion that some event of interest occurred or is true. It is customary to
call such evidence “testimonial.” The credibility of the person making the assertion
is always a possible source of doubt and for that reason testimonial evidence is
at least two inferential steps from the occurrence or nonoccurrence of events the
testimony is offered to support. The same is true with respect to tangible evidence –
its credibility attributes (authenticity, accuracy, and reliability) are possible sources
of doubt.
There may be even more inferential steps when the evidence is tangible. Sup-
pose that the tangible evidence is a document that the user can examine, such as
Agent Dawes’s memorandum in United States v. Able (pp. 23–27), and that what
is of interest in this document is Agent Dawes’s assertion that the accountant,
Timothy Cooper, had told him that papers in inactive client ﬁles had been lost
during his move to new ofﬁces in 2004. What is tangible is of course the document
and not the event to which it refers. In that situation, there are even more inferential
steps the user must consider before she reaches a conclusion with respect to events
reported.

When a person W testiﬁes about some event we are entitled to inquire about
how this person obtained her information about this event. Questions raised in
such inquiry are as varied as they are interesting. So, testimonial evidence from
a particular person can itself have different grounding. Did the person make a
direct observation, get the information at second hand, or is it merely an opinion
based on other observations? But testimonial evidence has other characteristics
we must recognize. In some situations witness W will give unequivocal testimony
that a certain event E did occur; W asserts: “Event E did occur.” Of course we
have uncertainty about whether or not E did occur even though W’s testimony is
not equivocal or is not hedged in any way. We have already examined some of the
speciﬁc sources of uncertainty we face as far as W’s credibility is concerned (veracity,
objectivity, and observational sensitivity).
In other situations a person may give testimony that is equivocal in nature. There
are at least two ways in which such equivocation may be expressed. In one case we
may ask W whether or not event E occurred and W responds by saying such things
as: “I couldn’t tell,” “I don’t remember,” or “I don’t know.” Such extreme equiv-
ocation may indicate an act of honest self-impeachment on W’s part; he actually
does not know or remember whether or not E occurred. However, W’s extreme
or complete equivocation is also consistent with the possibility that W does know
or can remember whether or not E happened but, for various reasons, refuses to
tell us. In other situations, however, W may hedge or equivocate in less extreme
ways. He may state, for example, “I believe it very probable that E did occur.” In
some situations he may attach speciﬁc numbers to grade the strength of his belief
regarding E; W might assert: “I am 70 per cent sure that E did occur.”
Either tangible or testimonial evidence rests, at some stage, upon someone’s
observations, your own or those of some other person. Again, if no person can be
identiﬁed who made a relevant observation of an object, event, or situation, our
hearing about the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event may be classed as rumor
or gossip. But there are situations in which expected evidence is either not found
or is not produced on request and we began to inquire why this is so. Evidence
we regard as missing may be either tangible or testimonial in nature. An example
follows.
You take your car in for routine service and are astonished by the amount you are
charged. One expensive item involved replacement of your fuel pump. You ask to see
your original pump that was replaced and the mechanic tells you that he discarded
it and cannot show it to you. You might easily regard his failure to produce this
tangible evidence with some suspicion. Our failure to ﬁnd evidence where we expect
to ﬁnd it or the failure of persons to produce things or provide testimony can in
many cases be regarded as a form of evidence. It is quite important to note that
having no evidence about an event is not the same as having evidence that this event
did not occur. The distinction between negative evidence and missing evidence is
not always made. The distinction is captured by the old saying, “Evidence of absence
is not the same as absence of evidence.”

Analysis of Evidence
Finally, there are other kinds of information we often use as evidence that do not
rest upon someone’s direct observation. We make frequent use of records we regard
asauthoritativeandwealsotakecertainthingsforgrantedwithoutfurtherevidence.
In other words, we often make use of what may be regarded as accepted facts. One
form of authoritative record is an almanac that supplies information about the
time of sunrise, lunar phases or times of high and low tide. Other examples include
tablesofchemicalcompounds,physicalconstants,mathematicalformulae,andtidal
occurrences. If you used such information in an inference task you would ordinarily
not be obliged to prove that the information is trustworthy or that someone actually
observeditinsome way. You would, of course, be obligedtoprovethatyouextracted
the correct information from any such authoritative records. Other information
often used in an inference is normally accepted without further proof. For example,
you would not be obliged to provide further proof about such matters as: Heroin is
a narcotic substance; gasoline is a ﬂammable substance; or that the population of
New York City exceeds that of Omaha.
Before we consider the column dimension of the taxonomy in Figure 2.8 there
is a very important thing to note about the forms of evidence listed in the columns.
Evidence that we have may exist in the form of combinations of these evidence types.
For example, we might have a transcript of a deposition. This is a tangible document
that we can examine for ourselves. But this document is a record of testimony given
by a witness W. In this recorded testimony W reports that, as a result of a direct
observation, he believes that event E occurred at a certain time. Here, of course, we
have the authenticity of the document to be concerned about as well as the veracity,
objectivity, and observational sensitivity of witness W. Other combinations of the
types of evidence shown in the rows of Figure 2.8 are easy to imagine. In every case,
we may have some quite difﬁcult credibility matters to consider if we are to believe
what these combinations of types of evidence seem to reveal.
The columns in Figure 2.8 arise in response to the question: How does an
evidence item stand in relation to the matters at issue in a particular inference?
Answers to this question involve the nature of the relevance of the evidence. It
will be necessary for us to recall the distinction between directly and indirectly
relevant evidence that we illustrated by means of Figure 2.6. The evidence taxon-
omy in Figure 2.8 differs slightly from the one shown in another work (Schum,
1994, 114–20). This other taxonomy preserves a distinction that has often been
made between two forms of directly relevant evidence: direct evidence and cir-
cumstantial evidence. Evidence is often said to be direct if it goes in one rea-
soning step to a matter revealed in the evidence. If you believe the evidence to
be perfectly credible, that settles the matter. Evidence is said to be circumstan-
tial if, even though perfectly credible, it provides only some but not complete
grounds for belief in some probandum or proposition. In other words, circumstan-
tial evidence, even though perfectly credible, is always just inconclusive on some
probandum.

Fact investigation and the nature of evidence
77
Thereasonwhywehavenotmadeadistinctionbetweendirectandcircumstantial
evidence is that the term direct evidence has several major difﬁculties.18 To illustrate
these difﬁculties, we ﬁrst make use of two “rules” that have been proposed by Binder
and Bergman (1984, 77–82). Their two rules are:
Rule 1. All evidence is either direct or circumstantial.
Rule 2. There is no such thing as direct evidence.
The ﬁrst rule reﬂects the fact that a probandum or proposition on which an item
ofevidencemayseemdirectdependsonhowwehavestructuredtheargumentbased
on this evidence. Second, every argument can be further decomposed to reveal new
sources of doubt or uncertainty. Thus, there is arbitrariness associated with any
identiﬁcation of an item of evidence as being direct.
There is just a bit more to be said about ancillary evidence and its inferential use.
Recall that evidence is ancillary if it bears upon the strength or weakness of links
in a chain of reasoning for evidence being argued as directly relevant. It happens
that we must also defend, by argument, the relevance and credibility “credentials” of
ancillary evidence. The relevance at issue here concerns whether or not the ancillary
evidence we offer actually bears upon the generalizations we assert in defense of the
direct relevance of other evidence. The result is that we may often have complex
arguments associated with any defense of the relevance and credibility of ancillary
evidence.
AsFigure2.8shows,therearetenpossiblecombinationsoftherowsandcolumns.
Thus, for example, tangible evidence of some form might be either directly relevant
or ancillary in nature relative to some problem and within some particular chain
of reasoning. The same is true for the other four basic types of evidence in the
remaining rows. The major virtue of the evidence taxonomy we have just presented
isthatitallowsustocharacterizeanytypeofevidencewithoutregardtoitssubstance
or content.

Principles of proof
A. Introduction: evidence in legal contexts
Within the common law tradition there has been a tendency to equate the subject of
evidence with the law of evidence and to marginalize or neglect other dimensions
suchasthelogicofproof,witnesspsychology,theevidentiarysigniﬁcanceofforensic
science, and the role of statistics and of narrative in arguing about and deciding
contested issues of fact in legal contexts. In Part B, we ﬁrst describe the shared
assumptionsuponwhichevidencescholarshavebasedtheirworkfortwocenturies–
the Rationalist Tradition – and its importance in contemporary practice and then
describe and illustrate the principles that form the basis for the logic of proof.
Part C begins with Wigmore’s explanation for his view that mastery of the prin-
ciples of proof is at least as important as mastery of the rules regulating the admis-
sibility and use of evidence. Part D introduces some terminology basic to under-
standing those principles. The probative processes and logical principles necessary
for analyzing evidence and marshaling arguments in legal contexts are presented
and developed in Part E.
B. The Rationalist Tradition1
The common law model of adjudication reﬂects some basic assumptions – assump-
tions about the nature and proper ends of adjudication, assumptions about the
natureofknowledgeandthepossibilityofmakingaccuratepresentjudgmentsabout
past events, and assumptions about what is involved in reasoning about disputed
questions of fact in forensic contexts. The assumptions underlying contemporary
theory and practice, at least as reﬂected in the writings of those who have specialized
in the ﬁeld of evidence, have persisted with little apparent change since the eigh-
teenth century. Throughout, the accepted assumptions have generally conformed
to an ideal type that has been characterized as “the Rationalist Tradition.”
An understanding of these assumptions is important to practitioners as well as to
scholars.Theyprovidetheframeworkwithinwhichrulesofprocedureandevidence
