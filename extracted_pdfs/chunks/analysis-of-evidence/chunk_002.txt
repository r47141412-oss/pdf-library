Evidence and inference: some food
for thought
A. Introduction
The ﬁeld of evidence is no other than the ﬁeld of knowledge. (Bentham, An Introductory
View, Chapter 1)
Evidence is the basis of justice: exclude evidence, you exclude justice. (Bentham, Ratio-
nale of Judicial Evidence, Part III, Chapter 1)
In this chapter we present some concrete examples and exercises that introduce
the main questions and the basic concepts that are involved in analyzing evidence.
The purpose of presenting them at this stage is partly to stimulate interest and
puzzlement and partly to encourage you to start to think actively about some basic
issues. We use many of the examples and exercises presented here to illustrate points
developed later in the book.
The examples in part B raise questions about the similarities and differences
involved in confronting problems of evidence and inference in different non-legal
contexts, including bible stories, intelligence analysis, famous “analysts,” and com-
monplace events. Each develops variations around the central theme that the kind
of reasoning involved in all these different kinds of factual enquiries is based on the
same underlying principles that apply differently as the contexts and standpoints
vary.
The examples in part C illustrate the same central theme using examples from
legal contexts. The ﬁrst four examples introduce the process of imaginative reason-
ing and the roles that generalizations and stories play in arguments about disputed
questions of fact. The remaining examples involve cases of increasing complexity
that focus upon the kinds of analysis required at different stages of criminal and
civil cases and raise issues about the relationship between law and fact, standards
of proof, and inferential reasoning in both kinds of cases.
This book is concerned with techniques of analysis, but a central theme is that
the logic of proof and the law of evidence are closely related and interdependent.
Sargent v Southern Accident Co. and United States v Able were originally devised as
examination questions in traditional evidence courses that had analysis of facts as
a signiﬁcant objective. Each item raises a number of interconnected issues dealing

Analysis of Evidence
with the law of evidence and problems of proof within the context of a case as a
whole. The ﬁnal exercise, “An investigation,” is intended as a vehicle for reviewing
the basic concepts and for introducing a vocabulary for discourse about analysis
and evaluation of evidence.
In our experience, all of these examples are good vehicles for use in teach-
ing and reﬂection, but it is not necessary to introduce all of them at the start of
a course. Several of the examples are used to illustrate important points in the
text (principally, the cases involving Bywaters and Thompson, Sacco and Vanzetti,
O. J. Simpson, the United States and Richard Able, Sargent and the Southern
Accident Co., and An investigation). Readers and teachers may wish to postpone
the detailed study of these until they come to the relevant topics.
B. Evidence and inference in non-legal contexts
1. Whose baby I? The judgment of Solomon
Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was
delivered of a child with her in the house. And it came to pass the third day after that I
was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no
stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. And this woman’s child died
in the night; because she overlaid it. And she arose at midnight, and took my son from
beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child
in my bosom. And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was
dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which
I did bear. And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is
thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they
spake before the king.
Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead:
and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. And the king
said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. And the king said,
Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. Then spake
the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her
son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the
other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it. Then the king answered and
said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. And all
Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for
they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment. (I Kings iii, 16–28)

c solving a problem for the future, or
d a combination of some or all of these?
2 Which of the following questions were pure questions of fact, and which were directly
in issue in this case?
a Who was the natural mother?
b Who would look after the child better?
c Who had a right to the child?
d What disposition would be in the best interests of the child?
3 What general assumptions about the relations between mothers and children are
implicit in this passage? Do you believe them to be universally or generally true today?
What is the basis for your belief?
4 Do you think that (a) both women genuinely believed that the child was theirs?
(b) both women believed that Solomon would carry out his threat?
5 Does this story suggest that Solomon’s “wisdom” was founded on the notion that he
was a clever investigator; a just judge; an enlightened problem-solver; or a potentially
good poker-player?
6 There are different versions of the Bible. In the Revised Standard Edition of the Bible,
the last sentence reads: “And all Israel heard the judgment which the king had
rendered; and they stood in awe of the king, because they perceived that the wisdom
of God was in him, to render justice.” What evidence should a biblical scholar
examine to determine which version is the most accurate? What standards should she
apply? What evidence should a Justice of the United States Supreme Court examine to
determine the meaning of a clause of the Constitution of the United States? What
standards should the Justice apply?
2. The intelligence analyst: an intelligence scenario “from the top-down”
Investigations and inferences in intelligence analysis share many elements of such
tasks that are performed in other areas such as law, medicine, history, and science.
There are three disciplines in which persons performing analytic tasks must be
prepared to encounter and evaluate every imaginable substantive kind of evidence;
thesedisciplinesarelaw,intelligenceanalysis,andhistory.Establishingtherelevance,
credibility, and inferential [probative] force of evidence is just as important in
intelligence analysis as it is in law.
During fact investigation in law, as well as in intelligence investigations, hypothe-
ses are generated as explanations for what is being observed. The generation of
hypotheses requires imaginative reasoning mixed with critical reasoning. New
hypotheses are put to use in generating new lines of inquiry and potential evi-
dence. One criterion for assessing the merit of a new hypothesis concerns how well
it assists the analyst in generating new and productive lines of inquiry that would
not have been generated from other existing hypotheses. On occasion, the role of
hypothesis generation is either downplayed or overlooked entirely. In some cases,
new hypotheses come in the form of guesses about what has happened or what will
happen. According to an old saying, hypotheses are like nets; only he who casts

Analysis of Evidence
will catch. In every episode of fact investigation in law, intelligence analysis, or else-
where, analysts have evidence in search of hypotheses at the same time as they have
hypotheses in search of evidence. The following is an example from intelligence
analysis in which a hypothesis is put to use in generating new observable evidence.
The generation of a new hypothesis from observations we make is frequently
said to involve “bottom-up” reasoning; generation of new potential evidence from
a hypothesis is said to involve “top-down” reasoning. In intelligence analysis, as in
law, both forms of reasoning are necessary.
An important area of intelligence analysis is called “Indications and Warnings”
(I & W). The purpose of I & W efforts is to alert decision-makers in our government
and military organizations to the existence of possible immediate or near-term
threats that are posed by hostile or potentially hostile forces or organizations. An
obvious objective of I & W efforts today is to predict and prevent terrorist actions
such as the destruction of the World Trade Center and parts of the Pentagon that
we witnessed on September 11, 2001, during which more than 3,000 lives were lost.
Those tragedies involved the hijacked domestic airliners used essentially as ﬂying
bombs. There is concern that such a method of destruction might be used again
in the future. Unfortunately, there are other methods that terrorist organizations
might employ in their efforts to cause loss of life, destruction, and widespread terror
in our homeland.
You are a member of an I & W team. Based upon recent intelligence reports,
your agency believes that there is a signiﬁcant possibility that one or more terrorist
groups are planning to commit a major terrorist action involving a “dirty bomb.”
Dirty bombs involve radioactive, but not ﬁssionable, materials such as strontium,
cobalt-60, and cesium 137. Such devices can be set off using conventional explosives
such as TNT, Semtex, or C-4 plastic explosives. They are much less expensive to
construct and require much less technical expertise.
A dirty bomb will simply have radioactive materials packed around a core of
conventional explosives. Such devices can be triggered electronically from remote
locations. When triggered, a dirty bomb can disperse radioactive material over a
wide area. Though dirty bombs cause far less destruction and loss of life, they do
produce serious consequences in any area where they are set off. Persons in the
immediate vicinity will be subject to serious radiation and the surrounding area
will be contaminated for long periods of time. A dirty bomb would certainly cause
panic throughout any country in which it is set off.
Cesium 137 has already been employed in suspected terrorist activities. In March
1996 it was reported that certain Chechen leaders had threatened to expose the city
of Moscow to radioactive devastation. Anonymous calls directed police ofﬁcers to
a park in Moscow where they would ﬁnd a container of powdered cesium 137.
Just a few ounces of this material could contaminate an entire city for decades.
It is estimated that just one ounce of powdered cesium 137 released by a dirty
bomb could spread radioactive fallout over 60 city blocks. Radioactive materials
such as strontium, cobalt-60, and cesium 137 have been widely used for various

medical and industrial purposes. For example, cesium 137 was used by the Soviets
to bombard wheat and other seeds to see if radiated seeds would produce more
abundant crops. It is also used in processing dental X-rays. Unfortunately, large
numbers of canisters of cesium 137, and other radioactive wastes are known to
be stored in facilities having little or no security. The Soviets appear to have left
considerable stores of powdered cesium 137 in various places in Georgia. No one
knows how much of this stored material has already been stolen or, possibly, sold.
Your I & W team has been assigned to the task evaluating the capabilities and
intentions of a certain known terrorist organization codenamed X. Based on recent
intelligence reports, your team has been asked to evaluate the hypothesis that
group X may be planning one or more actions using dirty bombs. According to
one report, a leader in group X was heard to boast that his group will have a very
unpleasant surprise for an unnamed American city. According to another report,
a person known to be a member of group X, codenamed “Ned,” was dismissed in
2002 from a doctoral program in nuclear physics at a university in Germany.
The I & W team must identify and carefully state the hypothesis regarding terror-
ist group X, taking into account the information it has. In any intelligence analysis
regarding the actions of some actual or potential adversary, the analysts need to
make inferences about an adversary’s capabilities and intentions. Capability and
intention must be distinguished: having capability does not entail intention, nor
does having intention entail capability. At the moment, however, the I & W team is
concerned with the capability of terrorist group X to develop a dirty bomb. Based
uponinformationaboutgroupX,theagencyconsidersitalmostcertainthatgroupX
has every intention of using any kind of weapon against the United States, given
the appropriate opportunity. Group X, like other current terrorist organizations,
seems to have an implacable hatred of American society and its values. Group X
has already participated in terrorist activities in which the lives of innocent persons,
including women and children, have been taken.
The team has identiﬁed the hypothesis as follows:
H: Group X now has the capability to assemble a dirty bomb containing cesium
137.
There is always an alternative hypothesis which, in this case, can be stated as:
not-H: Group X does not now have the capability to assemble a dirty bomb
containing cesium 137.
The team’s task is now to put hypothesis H to work in generating new evidence. The
team deems it very unlikely that it could obtain any direct evidence on H. Group X
maintains very strict control over the security of its operations and is known to have
employed the most medieval means of punishing any member whom it suspects of
divulging information about its activities. If they did have such direct evidence of
H, this evidence would be termed a “nugget.” Lacking any such nugget, they must
be prepared to mine lots of lower-grade evidential ore.

Analysis of Evidence
If hypothesis H is true, one proposition can easily be deduced: that group X
must have obtained, or will obtain, some powdered cesium 137. It is known that
such materials seem to be available throughout Eastern Europe including Georgia
and Poland. But we have no direct evidence that group X has in fact obtained any
powdered cesium 137. But, if group X has obtained, or will obtain, some pow-
dered cesium 137, we can deduce that some member of group X has had, or will
have, contacts with potential suppliers of powdered cesium 137 in Eastern Europe.
Finally, we deduce that the member of Group X who has had, or will have, contact
with potential suppliers of cesium 137 has at least some knowledge of radioactive
substances such as cesium 137. Figure 1.1 summarizes our top-down reasoning. At
each stage of this top-down reasoning we have a proposition that may be true or
false.
H: Group X now has the capability to assemble a 
dirty bomb containing powdered cesium 137.
G: Group X has obtained, or will obtain, a quantity of 
powdered cesium 137
F: A  member of group X has had, or will have, 
contacts with potential suppliers of powdered cesium 
137 in Eastern Europe
E: The member of Group X who has had or will have 
contacts with potential suppliers of powdered cesium 
137 has knowledge of radioactive substances.

physicsatauniversityinGermany.ThoughNedmayhavefailedtocompletehisPhD
in nuclear physics, we can easily suppose that he knows enough about radioactive
materials to be highly useful in obtaining such materials as powdered cesium 137
and in handling such materials during the construction of a dirty bomb. Here is a
summary of what this top-down reasoning has enabled us to do.
From hypothesis H the team has generated a new line of inquiry involving the
activities of group X. It is known that many members of known terrorist organi-
zations have studied various areas of the sciences in Western universities. It is also
known that not all of these persons have completed their degree requirements. So,
just ﬁnding out that Ned left a university without ﬁnishing his degree is, by itself,
quite uninformative. But the argument we have constructed links Ned with group
X’s efforts to develop one or more dirty weapons that could easily be used against
us.
The top-down reasoning we have developed seems entirely plausible. If H is
true, this suggests that G is true: Group X must have or will acquire some of this
radioactive material to develop a dirty bomb using cesium 137. If G is true, this
suggests that F is true: A member of group X has had or will have contact with
potential suppliers of cesium 137. Finally, if F is true, this suggests that E may be
true: Someone in group X is qualiﬁed to inspect the cesium 137, to see what kind
of container it is in, and how it might best be made available for use by group X in
constructing a dirty bomb.
Finally, we note that propositions or events at each stage of reasoning may or
may not be true; in other words, each proposition represents a source of doubt.
For a start, H might not be true; perhaps group X has other plans for our dis-
comfort. Proposition G might not be true either. Perhaps the cost of obtaining a
sufﬁcient quantity of cesium 137 exceeds the present resources of group X (another
hypothesis, D, to be explored). Or, perhaps the security of stores of radioactive
materials in Eastern Europe has tightened in light of public knowledge about how
weak such security has been in the past (another hypothesis, C, to be explored).
Proposition F might not be true since obtaining materials like cesium 137 might
not have to involve any member of group X itself (another hypothesis, B, to be
explored). It is possible that group X might have obtained some of this material
without exposing any of its members to the scrutiny of various intelligence agencies.
Finally, it might not require an unusual degree of expertise in nuclear physics to
negotiate for and obtain substances like cesium 137 (another hypothesis, A, to be
explored).
Questions and a problem
1 Your I & W team has received evidence from an airline that Ned traveled to Warsaw
last month and has booked another ﬂight to Warsaw next week. The argument
the team has constructed establishes the relevance of Ned’s travel activities to
hypothesis H. Ned is a member of group X who is qualiﬁed to inspect the cesium 137,

Analysis of Evidence
to see what kind of container it is in, and to work out how it might best be made
available for use by group X in constructing a dirty bomb. In light of those facts, you
have been asked to recommend steps that should be taken to conﬁrm or negate a new
hypothesis: Ned is traveling to Warsaw to arrange for or conﬁrm the arrangements for
the shipping and delivery of cesium 137 to group X. Will this require top-down or
bottom-up reasoning or both? Identify plausible innocent explanations inconsistent
with this new hypothesis. (There is a natural tendency to focus on ﬁnding evidence
that will support a hypothesis, but a good analyst knows that it is equally important to
seek evidence that would negate the hypothesis.)
2 How should the I & W team proceed to investigate hypotheses A, B, and C? Does your
response with respect to each hypothesis involve top-down or bottom-up reasoning
or both?
3 Top-down reasoning, as illustrated in the above ﬁctitious example, is very common in
fact investigation in law. Suppose your ﬁrm represents a client who claims that her
arm was broken when she slipped and fell down the stairs in the building where her
doctor has his ofﬁce. You have determined that the ﬁrm must show that the owner or
manager of the building breached a duty of care to warn persons who might use the
stairs of any unusual conditions that might cause an injury. The senior partner has
asked you to advise what steps the ﬁrm should take. Use the top-down method
illustrated above in formulating your response.
3. The doctor and the detective: Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle frequently mentioned that a major source of inspiration for
hisdevelopmentofthecharacterofSherlockHolmeswasaprofessorheencountered
when he was a student at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. Dr. Joseph
Bell was then a noted professor of surgery who, in 1887, was president of the Royal
College of Surgeons in Edinburgh. Dr. Bell was also personal surgeon to Queen
Victoria whenever she was in Scotland. For a time when he was in medical school,
Conan Doyle served as an assistant to Dr. Bell. As skilled as Dr. Bell was, it was
his astonishingly acute inferential or diagnostic skills for which he is now best
remembered, thanks, perhaps, to Sherlock Holmes. Over the years his students kept
an account of examples of Dr. Bell’s diagnostic feats, some of which are recorded in
Britain’s leading medical journals, such as the Lancet. Following is an example of
his diagnostic skill that today we would say involves the same abductive reasoning
illustrated in so many of the exploits of Sherlock Holmes and also illustrated in
Kemelman’s “The Nine Mile Walk.”
a. The doctor
The City of Edinburgh and its port city Leith lie on the Firth of Forth. Directly
north across the Firth lies a town in Fife called Burntisland [pronounced “burnt
island”]. In Bell’s day, there was no Forth Road Bridge; travelers used any one of a
number of ferries to cross from Fife to Edinburgh; the closest and most direct ferry
left Fife from Burntisland. From Leith, a street called Inverleith Row leads in the

direction of the University of Edinburgh. To the right of Inverleith Row, just past
Leith, lie Edinburgh’s Botanical Gardens. Dr. Bell frequently interviewed patients
in an amphitheater and allowed his students to observe these interviews. Here is
what his students observed on one occasion.
A woman, accompanied by a child, was shown into the amphitheater. Dr.
Bell had never met nor seen this woman before. After greeting her, Dr. Bell ﬁrst
asked her if she had a good crossing from Burntisland; the woman replied “aye”
[yes]. Bell then asked her if she had a good walk up Inverleith Row; the woman
replied “aye.” Then Bell asked her what she did with the other child; the woman
replied that she had left the child with her sister in Leith. Finally, Dr. Bell asked
the woman if she was still working at a linoleum factory; the woman replied
“aye.”
Dr. Bell’s students were of course astonished by this encounter between Dr. Bell
and the woman whom he had never seen before. In explanation, Dr. Bell ﬁrst told
his students that they must have noticed her Fife accent and that the closest ferry
would have left from Burntisland. He then asked the students if they noticed the red
clay on her shoes, which he explained was peculiar to areas around the Botanical
Gardens. Then Bell asked his students if they noticed that a coat the woman was
carrying over her shoulder was too large for the child who accompanied her; she
very likely had another child with her when she crossed from Fife. Finally, Dr. Bell
asked his students to observe the dermatitis on her hands, which he explained was
peculiar to persons who worked in linoleum factories.
b. The detective
“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.
“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I
should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.”
∗∗∗
“Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told
you, on our ﬁrst meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.”
“You were told, no doubt.”
“Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the
train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind that I arrived at the conclusion
without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The
train of reasoning ran, ‘Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a
military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for
his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He
has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm
has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics
could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded?
Clearly in Afghanistan.’ The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I
then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.” (Conan
Doyle, A Study in Scarlet (1887)).

Analysis of Evidence
Notes and a question
1 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle frequently mentioned that Dr. Joseph Bell was a major
source of inspiration for his development of the character of Sherlock Holmes.
For a time when he was in medical school Conan Doyle served as an assistant to
Dr. Bell. If you have read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories, you will note the
similarity between what happened in Dr. Bell’s interview just described and so
many instances in which Holmes amazed Dr. Watson with his acute
observational and inferential abilities. Both were highly skilled in the use of
what would today be called abductive logic. But abductive logic can only
identify hypotheses to be tested.
2 In these anecdotes Bell’s and Holmes’s hypotheses were conﬁrmed by the
woman and Watson respectively. Suppose that they had not. Absent
conﬁrmation, would you accept Dr. Bell’s or Holmes’s conclusions? Can you
construct a different scenario in each instance that would also be consistent
with all of the observed details?
4. Generalizations and stories: Sam’s party
Once upon a time, John went to Sam’s party. Sam blew out the candles.1
Questions
1 Is this a story?
2 Can you infer from this passage:
a That there was a cake?
b What kind of party this was?
c Sam’s age?
3 How would you justify such inferences?
C. Evidence and inference in legal contexts
1. Two murders
a. The murder of Y
Y was murdered in his home at approximately 4:30 p.m. on January 1. W states that
she saw X enter Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on that day. Show how W’s statement tends
to support the conclusion that it was X who murdered Y.
b. Bywaters and Thompson
Edith Thompson was charged with the murder of her husband Percy in that she
either conspired with or incited her lover, Frederick Bywaters, to murder Percy.
i In the trial it was assumed that the fact that Edith was 28 and Freddie was 20 was
relevant to the charge. Is this a reasonable assumption? If so, why?

illustrate the idea of confabulation.

ii Construct a chain of inferences from the fact that Edith was older than Freddie that
supports the proposition that Edith incited him.
iii Can the same fact be used as part of an argument in defense of Edith?
2. Imaginative reasoning: The Nine Mile Walk (Kemelman (1947))
I had made an ass of myself in a speech I had given at the Good Government Association
dinner, and Nicky Welt had cornered me at breakfast at the Blue Moon, where we
both ate occasionally, for the pleasure of rubbing it in. I had made the mistake of
departing from my prepared speech to criticize a statement my predecessor in the
ofﬁce of County Attorney had made to the press. I had drawn a number of inferences
from his statement and had thus left myself open to a rebuttal which he had promptly
made and which had the effect of making me appear intellectually dishonest. I was new
to this political game, having but a few months before left the Law School faculty to
become the Reform Party candidate for County Attorney. I said as much in extenuation,
but Nicholas Welt, who could never drop his pedagogical manner (he was Snowdon
Professor of English Language and Literature), replied in much the same tone that he
would dismiss a request from a sophomore for an extension on a term paper, “That’s no
excuse.”
Although he is only two or three years older than I, in his late forties, he always treats
me like a schoolmaster hectoring a stupid pupil. And I, perhaps because he looks so
much older with his white hair and lined, gnomelike face, suffer it.
“They were perfectly logical inferences,” I pleaded.
“My dear boy,” he purred, “although human intercourse is well-nigh impossible
without inference, most inferences are usually wrong. The percentage of error is par-
ticularly high in the legal profession where the intention is not to discover what the
speaker wishes to convey, but rather what he wishes to conceal.”
I picked up my check and eased out from behind the table.
“I suppose you are referring to cross-examination of witnesses in court. Well, there’s
always an opposing counsel who will object if the inference is illogical.”
“Who said anything about logic?” he retorted. “An inference can be logical and still
not be true.”
He followed me down the aisle to the cashier’s booth. I paid my check and waited
impatiently while he searched in an old-fashioned change purse, ﬁshing out coins one
by one and placing them on the counter beside his check, only to discover that the total
was insufﬁcient. He slid them back into his purse and with a tiny sigh extracted a bill
from another compartment of the purse and handed it to the cashier.
“Give me any sentence of ten or twelve words,” he said, “and I’ll build you a logical
chain of inferences that you never dreamed of when you framed the sentence.”
Other customers were coming in, and since the space in front of the cashier’s booth
was small, I decided to wait outside until Nicky completed his transaction with the
cashier. I remember being mildly amused at the idea that he probably thought I was
still at his elbow and was going right ahead with his discourse.
When he joined me on the sidewalk I said, “A nine mile walk is no joke, especially
in the rain.”

Analysis of Evidence
“No, I shouldn’t think it would be,” he agreed absently. Then he stopped in his stride
and looked at me sharply. “What the devil are you talking about?”
“It’s a sentence and it has eleven words,” I insisted. And I repeated the sentence,
ticking off the words on my ﬁngers.
“What about it?”
“You said that given a sentence of ten or twelve words – ”
“Oh, yes.” He looked at me suspiciously. “Where did you get it?”
“It just popped into my head. Come on now, build your inferences.”
“You’re serious about this?” he asked, his little blue eyes glittering with amusement.
“You really want me to?”
It was just like him to issue a challenge and then to appear amused when I accepted
it. And it made me angry.
“Put up or shut up,” I said.
“All right,” he said mildly. “No need to be huffy. I’ll play. Hm-m, let me see, how did
the sentence go? ‘A nine mile walk is no joke, especially in the rain.’ Not much to go on
there.”
“It’s more than ten words,” I rejoined.
“Very well.” His voice became crisp as he mentally squared off to the problem. “First
inference: the speaker is aggrieved.”
“I’ll grant that,” I said, “although it hardly seems to be an inference. It’s really implicit
in the statement.”
He nodded impatiently. “Next inference: the rain was unforeseen, otherwise he
would have said, ‘A nine mile walk in the rain is no joke,’ instead of using the ‘especially’
phrase as an afterthought.”
“I’ll allow that,” I said, “although it’s pretty obvious.”
“First inferences should be obvious,” said Nicky tartly.
I let it go at that. He seemed to be ﬂoundering and I didn’t want to rub it in.
“Next inference: the speaker is not an athlete or an outdoors man.”
“You’ll have to explain that one,” I said.
“It’s the ‘especially’ phrase again,” he said. “The speaker does not say that a nine-mile
walk in the rain is no joke, but merely the walk – just the distance, mind you – is no
joke. Now, nine miles is not such a terribly long distance. You walk more than half that
in eighteen holes of golf – and golf is an old man’s game,” he added slyly. I play golf.
“Well, that would be all right under ordinary circumstances,” I said, “But there are
other possibilities. The speaker might be a soldier in the jungle, in which case nine miles
would be a pretty good hike, rain or no rain.”
“Yes,” and Nicky was sarcastic, “and the speaker might be one-legged. For that
matter, the speaker might be a graduate student writing a Ph.D. thesis on humor and
starting by listing all the things that are not funny. See here, I’ll have to make a couple
of assumptions before I continue.”
“How do you mean?” I asked, suspiciously.
“Remember, I’m taking this sentence in vacuo, as it were. I don’t know who said it or
what the occasion was. Normally a sentence belongs in the framework of a situation.”
“I see. What assumptions do you want to make?”

“Foronething,Iwanttoassumethattheintentionwasnotfrivolous,thatthespeaker
is referring to a walk that was actually taken, and that the purpose of the walk was not
to win a bet or something of that sort.”
“That seems reasonable enough,” I said.
“And I also want to assume that the locale of the walk is here.”
“You mean here in Fairﬁeld?”
“Not necessarily. I mean in this general section of the country.”
“Fair enough.”
“Then, if you grant those assumptions, you’ll have to accept my last inference that
the speaker is no athlete or outdoors man.”
“Well, all right, go on.”
“Then my next inference is that the walk was taken very late at night or very early
in the morning – say, between midnight and ﬁve or six in the morning.”
“How do you ﬁgure that one?” I asked.
“Consider the distance, nine miles. We’re in a fairly well-populated section. Take
any road and you’ll ﬁnd a community of some sort in less than nine miles. Hadley is
ﬁve miles away, Hadley Falls is seven and a half, Goreton is eleven, but East Goreton
is only eight and you strike East Goreton before you come to Goreton. There is local
train service along the Goreton road and bus service along the others. All the highways
are pretty well traveled. Would anyone have to walk nine miles in a rain unless it were
late at night when no buses or trains were running and when the few automobiles that
were out would hesitate to pick up a stranger on the highway?”
“He might not have wanted to be seen,” I suggested.
Nicky smiled pityingly. “You think he would be less noticeable trudging along the
highway than he would be riding in a public conveyance where everyone is usually
absorbed in his newspaper?”
“Well, I won’t press the point,” I said brusquely.
“Then try this one: he was walking toward a town rather than away from one.”
I nodded. “It is more likely, I suppose. If he were in a town, he could probably arrange
for some sort of transportation. Is that the basis for your inference?”
“Partlythat,”saidNicky,“butthereisalsoaninferencetobedrawnfromthedistance.
Remember, it’s a nine mile walk and nine is one of the exact numbers.”
“I’m afraid I don’t understand.”
That exasperated schoolteacher-look appeared on Nicky’s face again. “Suppose you
say, ‘I took a ten mile walk’ or ‘a hundred mile drive’; I would assume that you actually
walked anywhere from eight to a dozen miles, or that you rode between ninety and a
hundred and ten miles. In other words, ten and hundred are round numbers. You might
have walked exactly ten miles or just as likely you might have walked approximately ten
miles. But when you speak of walking nine miles, I have a right to assume that you have
named an exact ﬁgure. Now, we are far more likely to know the distance of the city from
a given point than we are to know the distance of a given point from the city. That is,
ask anyone in the city how far out Farmer Brown lives, and if he knows him, he will say,
‘Three or four miles.’ But ask Farmer Brown how far he lives from the city and he will
tell you, ‘Three and six-tenths miles – measured it on my speedometer many a time.’

Analysis of Evidence
“It’s weak, Nicky,” I said.
“But in conjunction with your own suggestion that he could have arranged trans-
portation if he had been in a city – ”
“Yes, that would do it,” I said. “I’ll pass it. Any more?”
“I’ve just begun to hit my stride,” he boasted. “My next inference is that he was going
to a deﬁnite destination and that he had to be there at a particular time. It was not a
case of going off to get help because his car broke down or his wife was going to have a
baby or somebody was trying to break into his house.”
“Oh, come now,” I said, “the car breaking down is really the most likely situation.
He could have known the exact distance from having checked the mileage just as he
was leaving the town.”
Nicky shook his head. “Rather than walk nine miles in the rain, he would have
curled up on the back seat and gone to sleep, or at least stayed by his car and tried to
ﬂag another motorist. Remember, it’s nine miles. What would be the least it would take
him to hike it?”
“Four hours,” I offered.
He nodded. “Certainly no less, considering the rain. We’ve agreed that it happened
very late at night or very early in the morning. Suppose he had his breakdown at one
o’clock in the morning. It would be ﬁve o’clock before he would arrive. That’s daybreak.
You begin to see a lot of cars on the road. The buses start just a little later. In fact, the
ﬁrst buses hit Fairﬁeld around ﬁve-thirty. Besides, if he were going for help, he would
not have to go all the way to town – only as far as the nearest telephone. No, he had
a deﬁnite appointment, and it was in a town, and it was for some time before ﬁve-
thirty.”
“Then why couldn’t he have got there earlier and waited?” I asked. “He could have
taken the last bus, arrived around one o’clock, and waited until his appointment. He
walks nine miles in the rain instead, and you said he was no athlete.”
We had arrived at the Municipal Building where my ofﬁce is. Normally, any argu-
ments begun at the Blue Moon ended at the entrance to the Municipal Building. But
I was interested in Nicky’s demonstration and I suggested that he come up for a few
minutes.
When we were seated I said, “How about it, Nicky, why couldn’t he have arrived
early and waited?”
“He could have,” Nicky retorted. “But since he did not, we must assume that he was
either detained until after the last bus left, or that he had to wait where he was for a
signal of some sort, perhaps a telephone call.”
“Then according to you, he had an appointment some time between midnight and
ﬁve-thirty –”
“We can draw it much ﬁner than that. Remember, it takes him four hours to walk
the distance. The last bus stops at twelve-thirty a.m. If he doesn’t take that, but starts
at the same time, he won’t arrive at his destination until four-thirty. On the other
hand, if he takes the ﬁrst bus in the morning, he will arrive around ﬁve-thirty. That
would mean that his appointment was for some time between four-thirty and ﬁve-
thirty.”

“You mean that if his appointment was earlier than four-thirty, he would have taken
the last night bus, and if it was later than ﬁve-thirty, he would have taken the ﬁrst
morning bus?”
“Precisely. And another thing: if he was waiting for a signal or a phone call, it must
have come not much later than one o’clock.”
“Yes, I see that,” I said. “If his appointment is around ﬁve o’clock and it takes him
four hours to walk the distance, he’d have to start around one.”
He nodded, silent and thoughtful. For some queer reason I could not explain, I did
not feel like interrupting his thoughts. On the wall was a large map of the county and I
walked over to it and began to study it.
“You’re right, Nicky,” I remarked over my shoulder, “there’s no place as far as nine
miles away from Fairﬁeld that doesn’t hit another town ﬁrst, Fairﬁeld is right in the
middle of a bunch of smaller towns.”
He joined me at the map. “It doesn’t have to be Fairﬁeld, you know,” he said quietly.
“It was probably one of the outlying towns he had to reach. Try Hadley.”
“Why Hadley? What would anyone want in Hadley at ﬁve o’clock in the morning?”
“The Washington Flyer stops there to take on water about that time,” he said quietly.
“That’s right, too,” I said. “I’ve heard that train many a night when I couldn’t sleep.
I’d hear it pulling in and then a minute or two later I’d hear the clock on the Methodist
Church banging out ﬁve.” I went back to my desk for a timetable. “The Flyer leaves
Washington at twelve forty-seven a.m. and gets into Boston at eight a.m.”
Nicky was still at the map measuring distances with a pencil.
“Exactly nine miles from Hadley is the Old Sumter Inn,” he announced.
“Old Sumter Inn,” I echoed. “But that upsets the whole theory. You can arrange for
transportation there as easily as you can in a town.”
Heshookhishead.“Thecarsarekeptinanenclosureandyouhavetogetanattendant
to check you through the gate. The attendant would remember anyone taking out his
car at a strange hour. It’s a pretty conservative place. He could have waited in his
room until he got a call from Washington about someone on the Flyer – maybe the
number of the car and the berth. Then he could just slip out of the hotel and walk to
Hadley.”
I stared at him, hypnotized.
“It wouldn’t be difﬁcult to slip aboard while the train was taking on water, and then
if he knew the car number and the berth –”
“Nicky,” I said portentously, “as the Reform District Attorney who campaigned on
an economy program, I am going to waste the taxpayers’ money and call Boston long
distance. It’s ridiculous, it’s insane – but I’m going to do it!”
His little blue eyes glittered and he moistened his lips with the tip of his tongue.
“Go ahead,” he said hoarsely.
I replaced the telephone in its cradle.
“Nicky,” I said, “this is probably the most remarkable coincidence in the history of
criminal investigation: a man was found murdered in his berth on last night’s twelve-
forty-seven from Washington! He’d been dead about three hours, which would make it
exactly right for Hadley.”
