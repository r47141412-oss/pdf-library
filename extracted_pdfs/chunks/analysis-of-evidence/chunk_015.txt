b. Further extracts from the cross-examination of Bywaters
Look at the letter written on 1st October (exhibit No. 60) at the end –
Don’t forget what we talked in the Tea Room, I’ll still risk and try if you will – we only
have 3 3
4 years left darlingest.
What did you understand the risk was that she was prepared to run? – The risk of
being knocked about when she was asking for separation or divorce.
What was the risk that you were to run, “I will still risk and try if you will”? – “If
you will let me.”
How was she going to run the risk of being knocked about by telling her husband
she was going with you? – No, by asking for a divorce or separation.
Then you did in fact meet her and never went near her husband? – I kept away;
I did not want further trouble.
You met her at Fullers in the afternoon of 3rd October? – Yes.
Did you have any conversation about her husband? – No.
Did you not refer to him? – Only that she was going to the theatre.
She did tell you that she was going to the theatre? – Yes.
And she told you which theatre? – Yes.
After you left her I understand you went straight to the Graydons? – Yes.
Were you carrying your knife when you went there? – I was.
Did you carry that knife everywhere while in England? – Yes.
Did you ever use it for anything? – Cutting string or cutting things handy.
Is that the purpose for which you carried it? – I bought that – it may be handy at
any time.
A knife of that size and character? – Yes, handy at sea.
Handy at sea, but was it handy at home? – Yes.
c. Extracts from the examination of Thompson
The next letter I want you to look at is the one dated 20th August, 1921 (exhibit
12) –
Come and see me Monday lunch time, please darlint. He suspects.
What did you mean by “he suspects”? – I meant that my husband suspected I had
seen Bywaters; I think it was on the Friday previous to that date. I usually saw him
on Fridays, and I continued to see him until he sailed on 9th September. He came
back in the end of October, and remained in this country until 11th November.
After he sailed I corresponded with him, and among other letters I wrote exhibit
62, which is undated.
All I could think about last night was that compact we made. Shall we have to carry it
thro’? Don’t let us darlint. I’d like to live and be happy – not for a little while, but for all
the while you still love me. Death seemed horrible last night – when you think about

Analysis of Evidence
it darlint, it does seem a horrible thing to die, when you have never been happy really
happy for one little minute.
What compact were you referring to in that letter to Bywaters? – The compact of
suicide. We had discussed the question of suicide some time previous to the writing
of this letter; I cannot state when.
What was said about it? – That nothing was worth living for, and that it would
be far easier to be dead.
Had you discussed any particular means of committing suicide? – I believe we
had.
After Bywaters had sailed on that voyage did you send him from time to time
cuttingsoutofthepapers?–Idid.Theyweregenerallycuttingsofsensationalmatters
appearing at the time. Amongst the cuttings that I sent there was an account of an
inquest upon a girl, Freda Kempton, who had died through taking an overdose of
cocaine.
In your letter of 14th March, 1922 (exhibit 20), you say –
Enclosed are some cuttings that may be interesting. I think the ‘red hair’ one is true in
parts – you tell me which parts darlint. The Kempton cutting may be interesting if it’s
to be the same method.
What were you referring to there? – Our compact of suicide.
Look at the letter (exhibit 27) where you say –
I had the wrong Porridge to-day, but I don’t suppose it will matter, I don’t seem to care
much either way. You’ll probably say I’m careless and I admit I am, but I don’t care –
do you?
What were you referring to? – I really cannot explain.
The suggestion here is that you had from time to time put things into your
husband’s porridge, glass, for instance? – I had not done so.
Can you give us any explanation of what you had in your mind when you said
you had the wrong porridge? – Except we had suggested or talked about that sort
of thing and I had previously said, “Oh yes, I will give him something one of these
days.”
ByMr.Justice Shearman –Doyoumeanthatyouhadtalkedaboutpoison?–
I did not mean anything in particular.
Examination continued – We had talked about making my husband ill.
How had you come to talk about making your husband ill? – We were discussing
my unhappiness.
Did that include your husband’s treatment of you? – Yes.
Now you say you probably said that you would give him something? – I did.
Did you ever give him anything? – Nothing whatever. My husband took porridge
in the mornings. It was always prepared by Mrs. Lester, and never by me.
Further on in that same letter (exhibit 27), you say –

You know darlint I am beginning to think I have gone wrong in the way I manage this
affair. I think perhaps it would have been better had I acquiesced in everything he said
and did or wanted to do. At least it would have disarmed any suspicion he might have
and that would have been better if we have to use drastic measures.
What were you meaning by the “drastic measures” you might have to use? – Leaving
England with Bywaters.
Look now at the letter of 3rd January, 1922 (exhibit 13), where you say –
Immediately I have received a second letter, I have destroyed the ﬁrst and when I got
the third I destroyed the second and so on, now the only one I have is the “Dear Edie”
one written to 41, which I am going to keep. It may be useful, who knows?
Why were you keeping that letter? – I wanted to show it to my people if I were asked
if I had heard from Mr. Bywaters for Christmas. It was a letter wishing me all good
wishes for Christmas and my people were certain to ask if I had heard from him.
Otherwise I did not keep Bywaters’ letters, it being a habit of mine to destroy letters
that I had received.
d. Further extracts from the examination of Thompson
Turn now to your letter of 28th August (exhibit 63) –
Darlingest boy, to-day is the 27th and it’s on a Sunday, so I am writing this in the
bathroom, I always like to send you greetings on the day – not the day before or
the day after. Fourteen whole months have gone by now, darlint, it’s so terribly long.
Neither you nor I thought we should have to wait all that long time did we? altho’
I said I would wait 5 years – and I will darlint – it’s only 3 years and ten months
now.
What did you mean by that – it is only three years and ten months to what? – To
wait.
For what? – To live with Mr. Bywaters or go away with him, or be with him only.
Had you made arrangement with Bywaters to wait for ﬁve years? – Yes.
What was to happen at the end of ﬁve years? – If he was not in a successful
position to take me away or had not in the meantime found me something to go
to – well, we should part.
Mr. Justice Shearman – The other witness’s story was that they wanted
to commit suicide, and he said, “Put it off ﬁve years,” which seems to be the one
sensible thing I have heard.
(To Witness) – Was that discussed when you wanted to commit suicide together,
that you should put it off and wait ﬁve years to see how he was getting on? – We
might have discussed that, but I do not remember about it.
Examination continued – I was quite prepared to wait ﬁve years.
Will you turn to exhibit 28, where you say –

Analysis of Evidence
Yes, darlint, you are jealous of him – but I want you to be – he has the right by law to
all that you have the right to by nature and love – yes darlint be jealous, so much that
you will do something desperate.
What do you mean by doing something desperate? – To take me away at any cost,
to do anything to get me away from England.
Look at exhibit 60. Do you remember the day on which you wrote that letter? – I
think it was probably on the Monday, 2nd October. I saw Bywaters on the Monday,
but I could not be certain whether it was before or after the writing of the letter. On
the Saturday I had told him of my engagement to go to the theatre on the Tuesday.
It is quite probable that that engagement was made a fortnight before.
In that letter you say –
Darlint – do something tomorrow night will you?something to make you forget. I’ll
be hurt I know, but I want you to hurt me – I do really – the bargain now seems so
one-sided – so unfair – but how can I alter it.
“To-morrow night” was the night you were going to the theatre. What had Bywaters
to forget? – That I was going somewhere with my husband.
What was he to do to make him forget that? – I wanted him to take my sister Avis
out.
You say, “I will be hurt, I know.” What did that mean? – I should have been hurt
by Bywaters being with a lady other than myself.
In that letter you also say –
Darlingest ﬁnd me a job abroad. I’ll go tomorrow and not say I was going to a soul and
not have one little regret.
Did that really represent your feelings at that time, that you were prepared to go
abroad with him at once? – Yes. We had discussed it on the Saturday.
Look at the end of that letter –
Don’t forget what we talked in the Tea Room, I’ll still risk and try if you will.
What had you discussed in the tearoom? – My freedom.
Had you at any time from the month of June, 1921, to the month of October of
this year any desire for Bywaters to commit any injury on your husband? – None
whatever. Bywaters returned from his last voyage on 23rd September, but I did not
see him until Monday, the 25th. I saw him again during that week and at nine o’clock
on Saturday, the 30th. I left him to do some shopping, and then I rejoined him, and
was with him until mid-day. We spent the morning in Wanstead Park. I did not see
him again on the Saturday or the Sunday. I saw him on Monday, 2nd October, I
think at 2.15, outside 168 Aldersgate Street, and we lunched together. After lunch I
returned to business. I saw him again in Fullers about ﬁve o’clock that afternoon,
and I believe I had a coffee with him. I stayed with him until about quarter to seven,
when I returned home. I did not see him again that night.

213
During the time you were with Bywaters on the Saturday and the Monday, apart
from discussing a separation, did you discuss your husband at all? – No, I did not.
Was there any mention or any indication of a possible assault being committed
on him? – None whatever. On Tuesday, 3rd October, I went to business as usual,
and I saw Bywaters about 12.30, when we lunched together. I saw him again about
quarter-past ﬁve, and was with him for about quarter of an hour. After leaving
him I met my husband in Aldersgate Street, and we went straight west – about
quarter to six I think it was. We had a slight meal together before going to the
theatre.
Did you anticipate, or had you any reason to think, that you would see Bywaters
again that day or not? – None whatever. I had made arrangements to see him on
the following day at lunch time at 168 Aldersgate Street.
e. Extracts from cross-examination of Thompson
Had you any doubt when you were asked by the police about it that it was Bywaters
who was there and was the man? – No, I had not.
May I take it that when you made the long statement (exhibit 3) you left out
Bywaters’ name in order to shield him? – I did so.
Did you also say this in the statement: “I have always been on affectionate terms
with my husband”? – I cannot say that I actually said that. The statement was made
as question and answer.
I think it was read over to you and you signed it? – It might have been, yes.
At any rate, is the statement true or untrue? – It is untrue.
If you left Bywaters out of that statement in order to shield him, were you afraid
that if you brought his name into it he would be suspected? – I was not afraid of
anything. I left it out entirely.
Why? What were you afraid of if you did not know your husband had been
stabbed? – I was not afraid of anything.
What were you going to shield him from? – To have his name brought into it.
Were you not going to shield him from a charge of having murdered your hus-
band? – I did not know my husband was murdered.
Did you not know that your husband had been assaulted and murdered? – The
inspector told me, but I did not realise even at that time that he was dead.
Inspector Hall had told you then that your husband was dead? – He had.
When you told those untruths and left out Bywaters, were you not attempting to
shield him from a charge of having murdered your husband? – I did not even know
my husband had been murdered. When I say that I did not know, I mean that I did
not realise it.
I will ask you again, what were you attempting to shield Bywaters from? – From
being connected with me – his name being brought into anything.
Now, Mrs. Thompson, is it not the fact that you knew that Bywaters was going to
do something on this evening and that these two false statements were an attempt
to prevent the police getting wind of it? – That is not so.

Analysis of Evidence
Now I will go back to the early stages of your relationship with Bywaters. Do you
agree with me that it was in June of 1921 that you ﬁrst fell in love with Bywaters? –
No, I did not.
Do you put it in November? – September, I said.
Look at your letter of 28th August, 1922 (exhibit 63), where you say –
Fourteen whole months have gone by now, darlint, it’s so terribly long. Neither you nor
I thought we should have to wait all that long time.
Does that not satisfy you that you and Bywaters declared love to each other in June,
1921? – Not at all.
You deny that? – Yes.
When did you ﬁrst begin to address him as your lover? – It is just what you mean
by “your lover.”
The terms in which a woman does not write to any man except her husband? –
I cannot remember.
Did you from the ﬁrst time you realised you were in love with Bywaters take an
aversion to your husband? – For the ﬁrst time, did you say?
Did you ever take an aversion to your husband? – I did.
Can you tell me the date? – I think it was in 1918.
Then both before and after you and Bywaters fell in love with each other you
hated – is that too strong a word – your husband? – It is too strong.
Did your aversion to him become greater when you fell in love with Bywaters? –
I think not.
Were you happy with him after you fell in love with Bywaters? – I never was
happy with him.
Did you behave to him as if you were happy? – On occasions, yes.
Did your husband repeatedly ask you if you were happy? – He did.
And did you tell him you were happy? – I did.
Was that to deceive him? – It was to satisfy him more than to deceive him.
Did you seriously at that time intend to leave your husband or to give him cause
for divorce? – I did.
Did you ever tell him you had given him cause for divorce? – I did.
When, for the ﬁrst time? – I cannot remember.
Were you afraid your husband would ﬁnd out anything between you and
Bywaters? – What do you mean by “anything”?
Were you frightened that your husband would ﬁnd out anything between you
and Bywaters? – Except that we were meeting and he might come and prevent us
meeting.
But if you had told your husband that you had given him ground for divorce,
what were you afraid of beyond that? – I was afraid of my husband coming to my
place of business and making scenes as he had threatened.
You had told your husband that you had been unfaithful to him, or would be
unfaithful to him, and given him grounds for divorce? – I did.

Had he made scenes at your business when you told him that? – No, he did not,
but he had threatened to do so.
Whatwastheriskyouwererunning,theriskyousooftenmentionedtoBywaters?
Look at your letter of 4th July (exhibit 26) –
Why arnt you sending me something – I wanted you to – you never do what I ask you
darlint – you still have your own way always – If I don’t mind the risk why should you?
What risk? – That was the risk of Mr. Bywaters sending me something instead of
bringing something.
Why was that a risk? – Well, it would be a risk for me to receive anything.
Not a risk to receive a letter? – I did not say a letter.
What was it? – Whatever Mr. Bywaters suggested.
Why should you think there was a risk in his sending you something? – I did not
know that I should personally receive it.
Why should there be a risk in a friend or even a lover sending you a letter or a
present? – I did not say it was a letter.
What was it? – Something Mr. Bywaters suggested.
Did he suggest it was a dangerous thing? – No.
Why did you think it was a dangerous thing? – I did not think it was a dangerous
thing.
Why did you think there was a risk? – There was a risk to anything he sent me
that did not come into my hands ﬁrst.
Did you think it was because somebody would think there was a liaison going
on between you and him? – No, only you would not like anything private being
opened by somebody previous to yourself.
You were afraid somebody might have thought there were improper relations
between you and him. Is that what you are referring to? – No.
I understand you did not mind your husband knowing you and Mr. Bywaters
were lovers? – We wanted him to realise it.
The more it came to the knowledge of your husband the more likely you were to
achieve your design of divorce or separation; is that the fact? – No, that is not so.
The more it came to his knowledge the more he would refuse to give it me; he had
told me that.
In the passage I have read you were asking Bywaters to send something which he
had said, according to you, he was going to bring? – That is so.
What was it? – I have no idea.
Have you no idea? – Except what he told me.
What did he tell you? – He would bring me something.
Did he not say what the something was? – No, he did not mention anything.
What did he lead you to think it was? – That it was something for me to give my
husband.
With a view to poisoning your husband? – That was not the idea, that was not
what I expected.

Analysis of Evidence
Something to give your husband that would hurt him? – To make him ill.
And it was a risk for your lover to send, and for you to receive, something of that
sort? – It was a risk for him to send me anything he did not know came to my hands
ﬁrst.
Andaspecialrisktosendyousomethingtomakeyourhusbandill.Youappreciate
that? – Yes, I suppose it was.
You were urging Bywaters to send it instead of bringing it? – That is so.
Was that in order that it might be used more quickly? – I wrote that in order
to make him think I was willing to do anything he might suggest, to enable me to
retain his affections.
Mrs. Thompson, is that quite a frank explanation of this urging him to send
instead of bring? – It is, absolutely. I wanted him to think I was eager to help him.
By Mr. Justice Shearman – Eager to do what? – Eager to help him in doing
anything he suggested.
That does not answer the question, you know.
Cross-examination continued – He suggested giving your husband something to
hurt him? – He had given me something.
Given you something to give your husband? – That is so.
Did the suggestion then come from Bywaters? – It did.
Did the suggestion come in a letter or in a conversation? – I cannot remember.
Did you welcome it when it came? – I read it. What? – I read it and I studied it.
Didyouwelcome the suggestion that something shouldbegiventoyourhusband
to make him ill? – I did not.
Did you object to it? – I was astonished about it.
Did you object to it? – I did, at the time.
And although you objected to it you urged Bywaters to send it more quickly than
he intended? – I objected at the time. Afterwards I acquiesced.
From the time you acquiesced did you do all you could to assist Bywaters to ﬁnd
something which would make your husband ill? – I did not.
Did you try to prevent him from ﬁnding something to make your husband ill? –
I could not prevent him; he was not in England.
Did you try? – I do not see how I could have tried. Did you discourage him? – I
did, at ﬁrst.
And afterwards did you encourage him? – No.
Lookatyourletterof1stApril(exhibit17).Whatisthemeaningoftheinjunction
in that letter, “Don’t keep this piece”? – I cannot remember now.
Shall I help you to remember, if you read the next passage? – It may not have
referred to that piece.
Look at the original letter. You see that that injunction is written on the top of a
new page? – Yes.
Did you intend Bywaters not to keep that piece of paper? – No.
“Don’t keep this piece”? – I think you will see there has been something attached
to that piece of paper. There are distinctly two pin marks there.

217
You dispute my suggestion to you that “Don’t keep this paper” refers to the piece
on which the following is written? – I do.
Look at the next paragraph. It is about giving your husband something bitter. I
think you told your learned counsel that was an imaginary incident? – Yes.
Do you mean that you imagined it, or that your husband did? – I imagined it.
Do you mean you invented the incident altogether for Bywaters’ information? –
I did.
Can you tell me what the object of that was? – Still to make him think I had done
what he suggested.
By Mr. Justice Shearman – Had done what? Given your husband some-
thing? – Yes.
Cross-examination continued – Was it with the same object that you wrote the
paragraph lower down, “Don’t tell Dan.” You say –
What I mean is don’t let him be suspicious of you regarding that – because if we were
successful in the action –
Does that refer to the proposal that Bywaters had made, that you should make your
husband ill? – I think not.
What do you think it refers to? – The action of my going away to live with him
unmarried.
I’m going to try the glass again occasionally – when it is safe. I’ve got an electric light
globe this time.
When was it likely to be safe? – There was no question of it being safe; I was not
going to try it.
Why did you tell Bywaters you were going to try it when it was safe? – Still to let
him think I was willing to do what he wanted.
You are representing that this young man was seriously suggesting to you that
you should poison and kill your husband? – I did not suggest it.
I thought that was the suggestion? – I did not suggest that.
What was your suggestion? – He said he would give him something.
By Mr. Justice Shearman – Give him something in his food; you answered
my question a little while ago that it was to give him something to make him ill? –
That is what I surmised, that I should give him something so that when he had a
heart attack he would not be able to resist it.
You are suggesting now that it was Bywaters who was suggesting that to you? –
Yes.
And you did not do it? – No, never.
Cross-examination continued – Why were you urging Bywaters to do something
if the suggestion really came from him? In your letter of 10th February (exhibit 15)
your ﬁrst sentence is, “You must do something this time”? – I was not referring to
that at all. I was referring to him getting me something to do, a position of some
sort abroad.

Analysis of Evidence
Let us see what the rest of the letter was. The fourth paragraph is the one that
relates to the incident of your husband waking up and asking you for water as he
was feeling ill. Was that a true incident? – Absolutely true.
Why did you hunt for the prescription? Was that to prevent a similar incident? –
Probably. I did not think it was wise for him to do those things.
Was your anxiety so that you should get hold of the prescription and avert the
catastrophe of taking an overdose? – Yes.
Do you mean you were really frightened about your husband’s overdose? – I was.
Then can you explain to me the meaning of the next sentence –
I told Avis about the incident only I told her as if it frightened and worried me as I
thought perhaps it might be useful at some future time that I had told somebody.
Was it true that you were frightened and worried, or was it acting? – No, that was
true.
You were frightened and worried? – I was.
WhydidyoutakespecialpainstotellAvisasifyouwerefrightenedandworried?–
I was worried and frightened and told my sister.
Why was it likely to be useful to pretend that you were frightened and worried? –
If anything had happened to my husband it would have been much better for
somebody else to know besides myself.
And you thought it would have been much better for you, if you poisoned your
husband, if you professed anxiety to Avis previously? – I had no intention of ever
poisoning my husband.
Look at the next paragraph –
What do you think, darlint. His sister Maggie came in last night and he told her [I
suppose “he” is your husband] so now there are two witnesses, although I wish he
hadn’t told her – but left me to do it.
Now,thatistosayyouwantedagaintocreatetheimpressionthatyouwerefrightened
byyourhusband’sattacks?–Ididnotwanttocreatetheimpression.Iwasfrightened.
It would be so easy darlint – if I had things – I do hope I shall.
What would be easy? – I was asking or saying it would be better if I had things as
Mr. Bywaters suggested I should have.
What would be easy? – To administer them as he suggested.
“I do hope I shall.” Was that acting or was that real? – That was acting for him.
You were acting to Bywaters that you wished to destroy your husband’s life? – I
was.
By Mr. Justice Shearman – One moment, I do not want to be mistaken.
Did I take you down rightly as saying, “I wanted him to think I was willing to take
my husband’s life”? – I wanted him to think I was willing to do what he suggested.
That is to take your husband’s life? – Not necessarily.

219
Cross-examination continued – To injure your husband at any rate? – To make
him ill.
What was the object of making him ill? – I had not discussed the special
object.
What was in your heart the object of making him ill? So that he should not
recover from his heart attacks? – Yes, that was certainly the impression, yes.
The Court adjourned.
C. Comments
Arguments about the degree of Edith Thompson’s guilt or innocence can never now
be ﬁnally settled. One thing is incontrovertible, i.e. the aura of sexual prejudice (as
palpable as anti-Semitism, apartheid, or any other form of paranoia), which pervaded
the court when she was tried. Even her co-defendant Bywaters may have been an
indirect victim of it. He was presented as the helpless prey of an evil woman and in
that role attracted some sympathy; but if murder had been done his was undoubt-
edly the hand that committed it. Thus the people who were determined that Edith
should swing for it could not have got her without getting him too. (Elaine Morgan
(1979))
Age is eternally jealous of youth; impotence is jealous of passion; law is jealous of
liberty; those who have found happiness within the pale are apt to look with suspicion
and misgiving on those who dare to seek and ﬁnd happiness without the pale. Intellect
affects to despise emotion; yet a real and deep emotion, however wayward, is a more
vital thing than are the sterile and negative barriers within which, necessarily, but in
vain, the social state tries to conﬁne it. That is why we have Courts of law, for a world
ruled only by emotion would be a dreadful place. The lesson of it all surely is never to
let emotion escape from its own sphere, to wander into the dreadful wilderness that
ends in the Court and the prison house. Mr. Justice Shearman frequently referred to
Bywaters as “the adulterer,” apparently quite unconscious of the fact that to people
of Bywaters’s generation, educated in the ethics of dear labour and cheap pleasure, of
commercial sport and the dancing hall, adultery is merely a quaint ecclesiastical term
for what seems to them the great romantic adventure of their lives. Adultery to such
people may or may not be “sporting,” but its wrongness is not a matter that would
trouble them for a moment. Sinai, for them, is wrapped in impenetrable cloud. And if
we are not prepared to adapt the laws of Sinai to the principles of the night club and
the th´e dansant, I see no other alternative but to educate again our young in the eternal
verities on which the law is based. (Filson Young (1951))
No one can say
That the trial was not fair. The trial was fair, Painfully fair by every rule of law,
And that it was made not the slightest difference. The law’s our yardstick, and it
measures well.
Or well enough when there are yards to measure. Measure a wave with it, measure
a ﬁre, Cut sorrow up in inches, weigh content. You can weigh John Brown’s body

Stephen Vincent Benet (1961))
D. Notes and questions on Rex v. Bywaters and Thompson
A. Some threshold questions
1 “Love letters cannot appropriately and should not be used as evidence in a court of
law.” Do you agree?
2 What, in your view, are the main problems in using love letters as evidence in a case of
this kind?
3
(a) What issues of admissibility of evidence could have been raised by the defence in
respect of the letters?
(b) Was it open to the judge to admit some letters but exclude all or parts of others?
B. Clariﬁcation of standpoint
(Who am I? At what stage(s) in what process am I? What am I trying to do?)
4
(a) Identify six signiﬁcantly different standpoints for a Wigmorean analysis of
Bywaters and Thompson.
(b) Before starting on the exercise, state what you would expect to be the main
differences in the analysis of the case from each of the six different standpoints.
(c) Which, if any, of the standpoints insures a whole-hearted commitment to truth?
C. Ultimate probanda
5
(a) What were the ultimate probanda for each of the counts in Indictment No. 2?
(b) What were the ultimate probanda for the charge in Indictment No. 1?
(c) Which of the offences charged in Indictment No. 2 are included in the offence
charged in Indictment No. 1?
6
(a) From the standpoint of counsel for the Crown, what issues of substantive law
had to be decided in order to frame the two indictments? In order to make the
decision to proceed on Indictment No. 1?
(b) From the standpoint of the defense, were there any additional questions of
substantive law that needed to be resolved in order to prepare the defense?
(c) From the standpoint of the historian, are there issues of substantive law on which
you would need advice in order to do a thorough analysis of the evidence in
relation to the question: Was Edith responsible for the death of Percy?
7 In order to convict Edith Thompson of murder, was it necessary for the prosecution
to prove (a) that Frederick Bywaters murdered Percy Thompson? (b) that the speciﬁc
attack was premeditated? Both?
D. Penultimate probanda, theories, and themes
8
(a) Formulate, in not more than 150 words each, two alternative “theories of the
case” from the standpoint of (a) the prosecution; (b) the defense.

(b) Identify two or three themes that would be suitable in presenting and supporting
each theory at the trial.
9 Outline the main hypotheses favoring the prosecution and those favoring the defense
that an historian might want to analyze in light of the evidence available in terms of
the concepts presented here. How might these differ from the theories of the case of
each side?
E. The chart method: application and appraisal
10 (a) Was it (i) necessary (ii) sufﬁcient with respect to the charge of murder for the
prosecution to prove attempted murder by poison or broken glass (Counts 4 and
5 of Indictment No. 2) on prior occasions? To what issue(s) in respect of the
charge of murder are such allegations relevant?
(b) Construct a key-list and chart of the prosecution’s main theories of the case.
(c) Construct a key-list and chart of the defense’s argument in relation to the
proposition: “Freddy’s attack on Percy was premeditated.” Is this an example of a
“jugular” argument?
11 What “aids” or techniques of textual interpretation are helpful in analyzing the letters
in Bywaters and Thompson?
12 Compile a key-list and chart of propositions in respect of the following passages:
(a) Exhibit 60: “Don’t forget what we talked in the Tea Room . . . Try and help.”
(b) Exhibit 15: “It would be so easy Darlint – if I had things – I do hope I shall. How
about cigarettes?”
(c) Exhibit 19: “I was buoyed up with the hope of the ‘light bulb’ and I used a
lot. . . . I wish oh I wish I could do something.”
(d) Exhibit 17. All the potentially signiﬁcant statements.
13 (a) In relation to Exhibit 17 (above, page 188) Ren´e Weis wrote:
That this piece of fantasy could ever be construed as part of a premeditated
murder plot deﬁes belief. Bywaters knew it was a ﬁction and that she had
herself tasted the quinine in the tea to be able to give an accurate account of
Percy’s complaint. In the court the jurors were told that “the passage is full of
crime”. Yes, as long as it is understood that “crime” means “imaginary crime”.
It is never easy to separate fact and ﬁction in Edith’s extensive and intense
correspondence, and though outside evidence is available to help distinguish
one from the other, the more intimately acquainted the reader becomes with
the correspondence, the more complex its rash interweaving of fact and ﬁction
is bound to appear. In most of our lives blurring is not uncommon. It is not
always harmless. But it is seldom the matter of life and death into which it
developed here. (Weis (2001: 105). Compare Rethinking at 316–18.)
Construct an argument to show that this letter is relevant evidence to support at
least one important probandum.
(b) A pin-hole has been noticed at the top of Exhibit 17, but no attachment has been
found. Has this any evidentiary potential?

Analysis of Evidence
14 (a) What bearing, if any, does the character of each of the main protagonists have on
the case as a whole?
(b) Strictly on the basis of the available evidence give a description of Edith’s character
(i) which favors the prosecution’s case; (ii) which favors the defense’s case.
(c) Is it possible to give an account of Edith Thompson’s character which is (i) neutral;
(ii) impartial; (iii) falsiﬁable; (iv) false; (v) completely true; (vi) simply factual?
(d) Can the letters be interpreted to suggest that the relationship between Edith and
Freddy underwent signiﬁcant changes over time? If so, does this help the defense
or the prosecution case?
15 Can you imagine any theories, techniques or developments in (a) logic;
(b) psychology; (c) textual analysis; (d) forensic science; (e) computer applications:
(f) medical knowledge; (g) other ﬁelds of inquiry which could settle once and for all
any of the outstanding central questions concerning Bywaters and Thompson?

(a) cryptic, vague, or ambiguous statements in letters;
(b) the character of important protagonists;
(c) probability judgments;

concepts and distinctions:
(a) Propositions of fact; normative propositions; speculative statements; opinions;
background generalizations.

H. Other dimensions
19 In the story of Bywaters and Thompson, viewed as a total process involving a ﬂow of
decisions and events, what in your view were crucial decisions, especially mistaken
decisions, made by each of the main protagonists?
20 A group of supporters of Edith Thompson is planning to petition the English
Criminal Cases Review Commission to reconsider her conviction. Leaving aside the
issue whether this case happened too long ago, an important element in such a
review would be whether there is signiﬁcant new evidence to render the conviction
unsafe. Use your imagination to identify what kinds of new evidence might be
helpful in this context, if it were available.
21 The Lord Chief Justice stated in regard to the route followed by the Thompsons on the
evening of October 3: “It was an indirect way from the station to the house.” (above,
page 166). There is nothing in the record of the trial to support this statement, which
is contradicted by contemporary maps and by the fact that the Thompsons were not
alone in taking this route. So this appears to be an invented “fact.” What is the
signiﬁcance, if any, of this point? Could this count as “new evidence”?
22 To what extent did prevailing attitudes toward women play an important part in the
story?
23 After observing her and talking with her over several weeks after her conviction, the
prison governor of Holloway was convinced of Edith Thompson’s innocence. Assess
the value of such evidence from the point of view (a) of an historian (b) of the Home
Secretary, considering clemency.

Evaluating evidence
A. Introduction
The preceding chapters focused upon the logic of proof and methods for analyzing
evidence in a variety of contexts – for example, analyzing the evidence in an ongoing
investigationorinadecidedcaseorinpreparingfortrial.Itshouldbeclear,however,
that developing the strongest theory of a case and determining how the evidence
can best be marshaled to support a probandum necessarily requires that the analyst
make evaluative judgments. So far, we have not directly addressed the problems
of or techniques for evaluating the probative value of evidence or the strength or
cogency of arguments about particular aspects of the evidence or about the evidence
in a case-as-a-whole. This chapter and the next focus upon those problems and
techniques.
A lawyer must confront the problems at every stage of a case. For instance, in a
civil case, from the initial interview onward, the lawyer must assess the weight and
force of the evidence that is available and that is likely to become available. Should
the case be taken? Filed? Pursued? Is the case ready for trial or is further investigation
or discovery justiﬁed or required? Given the available evidence and the operative
law, should the case be settled and, if so, on what basis? At trial, the questions
concern both the lawyers and the decision-makers. Does the particular evidence
proffered have such probative value that it should be admitted notwithstanding any
improper prejudicial effects that it may have? Is the evidence as a whole sufﬁcient
to warrant submission of the case to a jury? Does the evidence prove the claim to
the required standard? The lawyer must argue and the appropriate decision maker
must decide these questions based upon an assessment of the probative value or
force of the parts or the weight of the whole of the evidence.1 Similar questions arise
in criminal processes from the start of an investigation through trial, appeal, and
beyond.
1 The terms “probative value,” probative force,” and “weight” do not have generally accepted mean-
ings. In this book, “probative value” and “probative force” are used where the discussion focuses
on the value or force of particular items of evidence. “Weight” is used where the discussion focuses
on a mass of evidence.

Questions such as these pose fundamental issues that are of concern to lawyers,
judges, and others interested in the processes by which disputed questions of fact are
adjudicated. A central issue may be stated thus: Do the standards of decision provide
meaningful guidance for those who must apply them in the process or for those
who would appraise the outcome of the process? For lawyers, the question is central
becausethestandardsestablishtheframeworkwithinwhichtheymustadviseclients,
make decisions, and frame arguments to courts and juries. For judges and juries,
the question is central because the standards deﬁne the range of their discretion
and purport to provide meaningful guidance for the exercise of that discretion. For
those concerned with adjudication as an aspect of the judicial system, the question
is central because the operation of the standards in some measure determines the
extent to which the system is or could be viewed as rational and fair.
Standpoint is central for lawyers addressing questions such as these. Lawyers are
the primary decision-makers with respect to questions of procedure and strategy.
The lawyer’s objective must be to decide how to construct arguments that will
persuadeotherdecision-makersthat,fromtheirrespectivestandpoints,thedecision
sought is the decision that they should make. Other decisions must be made or
approved by clients, by opposing counsel and their clients, by arbitrators, by judges,
or by juries. The lawyer’s role varies; it may be to advise or to persuade or negotiate.
Forthatreason,thekindsofquestionsthatalawyermustconsiderinconstructing
arguments to persuade others are extensive. To identify a few: Is the client risk-
adverse, risk-neutral, or risk-preferring? The decision to settle or accept a plea or
try a case is ultimately the client’s not the lawyer’s. In the United States, the lawyer
mustconsiderquestionssuchas:Doesthejudgehavetorunforre-election?Ifso,can
she reasonably be expected to rule against the prosecution and police on important
issues or on a regular basis? Is the judge a federal judge appointed for life who can
make unpopular decisions without worrying about her position or livelihood. If so,
does she have ambitions to be promoted to the court of appeal or to be appointed to
highofﬁceintheexecutivebranch?Whatgeneralizationsarethejurorsselectedlikely
to hold and which generalizations can the jury as a whole be persuaded to accept
in evaluating the evidence and the competing stories constructed by the lawyers?
In England the questions are less obvious, but the lawyer must still consider the
background of the decision-makers.
In this chapter, we establish a framework that lawyers (or others) might use in
addressing questions such as these at all stages of a case. In Part B, we describe
techniques for evaluating and constructing arguments about the weight or the
probative value of evidence. That part describes the traditional vocabularies that
lawyers and judges use in expressing their views on the probative value of particular
segments of the evidence or on the weight of the evidence as a whole. In Part C, we
examine standards for decision, standards for pretrial decisions that lawyers and
clients must make, and standards for decisions in adjudication. Those standards
provide the framework within which arguments about the probative value or weight
of the available evidence must be constructed and resolved. Those standards guide

Analysis of Evidence
lawyers in evaluating evidence and framing arguments to persuade others that the
available evidence measured by the applicable standard compels the decision the
lawyer seeks.
B. Evaluating the weight and probative force of evidence
1. No rules of weight
Until recently most legal scholars have accepted the view that evaluation of evi-
dence can rarely be governed by rules. That view can be traced to the earliest views
expressed by theorists of evidence through the present day. For example, if Jeremy
Bentham had had his way, there would have been no binding rules of evidence at
all:
To ﬁnd infallible rules for evidence, rules which insure a just decision, is, from the
nature of things, absolutely impossible; but the human mind is too apt to establish
rules which only increase the probabilities of a bad decision. All the service that an
impartial investigator of the truth can perform in this respect is to put legislators and
judges on their guard against such hasty rules.2 (J. Bentham (1825) 180)
Bentham’s views have not prevailed. But his “anti-nomian” thesis has been much
more successful than is generally acknowledged. With only a few exceptions, there
is an almost total absence of formal regulation in respect of evaluating evidence
or, to put it differently, the Anglo-American law of evidence has almost no rules
of weight. Thayer’s statement of the predominant view would be accepted by most
courts and scholars today:
The judicial ofﬁce is really one of administration . . . While these are some of the chief
characteristics of legal reasoning, it will be noticed that they are only, in the nature
of them, so many reasonable accommodations of the general process to particular
subject-matters and particular aims. Amidst them all the great characteristics of the
art of reasoning and the laws of thought still remain constant. As regards the main
methods in hand, they are still those untechnical ways of all sound reasoning, of the
logical process in its normal and ordinary manifestations; and the rules that govern
it here are the general rules that govern it everywhere, the ordinary rules of human
thought and human experience, to be sought in the ordinary sources, and not in law
books. (Thayer (1898) 274–75)
Wigmore was even more explicit on this issue:
The rules of Admissibility have nothing to say concerning the weight of evidence when
once admitted. The relative weight of circumstantial and testimonial evidence, there-
fore, does not present itself in this place. Indeed, it can be said that there are no rules,
2 The nearest he ever came to qualifying this view is in the following passage: “To take the business
out of the hands of instinct, to subject it to rules, is a task which, if it lies within the reach of human
faculties, must at any rate be reserved, I think, for the improved powers of some maturer age.”
(Bentham (1827) vol. 1, 44)
