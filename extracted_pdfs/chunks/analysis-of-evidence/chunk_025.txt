Analysis of Evidence
I really can’t recall any of the details of their conversation, though I think he told
Ernest he would like for him to come back and visit him again sometime.
After Ernest left, my dad told me that he wanted to write something, and he
asked me to give him a piece of paper and a pen. Later in the day, about 5:30 or so,
he started writing on the piece of paper. At the time, I observed him to be normal
and mentally alert. He was a little bit tired at the time, and when I suggested that
he stop worrying about writing anything, he got very upset and even cried a little
bit and pleaded with me to help him get on with what he intended to do. At one
point he did ask me to steady his hand a bit because it was shaking. When I did so,
I observed only a few of the words he was writing, and I didn’t really know what
he was doing. When he ﬁnished, he folded the piece of paper and placed it on his
bedside table. Sometime later, I observed his breathing to become somewhat forced,
and I contacted the nurses’ station to tell them to come check on him. From that
point on, his condition seemed to change for the worse. During that evening, Ernest
Potter came by for a few minutes, and he said, “I’m here like your dad asked.” When
Ernest left, I went outside and handed to him the piece of paper that my dad had
been writing out, which I assumed to be either a loan to me or a letter to someone,
and I might have even thought at that time that it was a will. I don’t really recall
telling Ernest that the paper was my dad’s will or anything else I may have said to
Ernest at the time, since I was so upset.
Shortly after Ernest left, my dad’s condition got so much worse that I was forced
to leave the room. The nurses and doctors were there for the rest of the evening,
and shortly after 11:30 p.m., the same nurse who had spoken with me on the ﬁrst
date of my arrival, Pat Duffey, came outside to tell me that my father had suffered
an additional stroke and had passed away as a result.
The next morning I went by to see Ernest Potter to thank him for his friendship
and kindness extended to me and my father. It was at that time that Ernest gave me
the will my father had written. I then observed that Ernest had written on the will
that he was a witness to it, and I asked him why he had done that. Ernest told me
that he thought that would make everything legal and that he knew that was what
my dad wanted. I think Ernie Potter is a very good man, and I have kept in touch
with him since that time.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
377
Charge of the Court
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY:
This case is submitted to you on special interrogatories consisting of speciﬁc
questions about the facts, which you must answer from the evidence you have
heard in this trial. You are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the
weight to be given their testimony, but in matters of law, you must be governed by
the instructions in this charge. I shall now give you additional instructions which
you should carefully and strictly follow during your deliberations.
1 Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.
2 Since every answer that is required by the charge is important, no juror should state or
consider that any required answer is not important.
3 You must not decide whom you think should win, and then try to answer the
questions accordingly.
4 Certain words are used in this charge for which you are given a proper legal deﬁnition,
and you are bound to accept the Court’s deﬁnition in place of any other meaning.
5 There is no “Dead Man’s Statute” in the state of Nocona, and thus you may consider
in your deliberations whatever evidence the Court may have admitted, with any
limiting instructions, pertaining to the decedent.
6 Answer with “Yes” or “No” unless otherwise instructed. A “Yes” answer must be based
on a preponderance of the evidence. If you do not ﬁnd that a preponderance of the
evidence supports a “Yes” answer, then answer “No.”
7 PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE means the greater weight and degree
of credible testimony or evidence introduced before you and admitted in this case.
INTERROGATORY NO. 1: Do you ﬁnd from a preponderance of the evidence
that at the time James Dale Warren, Deceased, executed the holographic will dated
October 31, last year, introduced in evidence in this case, he had testamentary
capacity?
Deﬁnition: “Testamentary capacity.” In connection with the foregoing interrogatory,
you are instructed that, for a person to have “testamentary capacity,” as that term is
used in this charge, such person at the time of the execution of the will must have had
sufﬁcient mental ability to understand the business in which he was engaged, the effect
of his act in making the will, the nature and extent of his property; he must have been
able to know his next of kin and the natural objects of his bounty and their claims
upon him; he must have memory sufﬁcient to collect in his mind the elements of the
business about to be transacted and to hold them long enough to perceive at least their
obvious relation to each other and to be able to form a reasonable judgment as to
them.
ANSWER TO INTERROGATORY NO. 1:
Answer “Yes” or “No”
INTERROGATORY NO. 2: Do you ﬁnd from a preponderance of the evidence
that at the time James Dale Warren executed the holographic will dated October 31,

last year, introduced in evidence in this case, he was caused to do so under and by
reason of the undue inﬂuence of Jim Warren?
Deﬁnition: “Undue inﬂuence.” In connection with the foregoing interrogatory, you
are instructed that the term “undue inﬂuence” means such improper domination,
constraint,orcontrolofoneperson,exercisedoverthemindofanotherastobesufﬁcient
to subvert and overthrow such other person’s volition, so that the party inﬂuenced has
been thereby induced to do what he would not have done had he been left to act freely
andvoluntarily.Theinﬂuencemustbesuchthattheactsodonerepresentsaresultofthe
exercise of such domination, constraint or control, rather than the will and expression
of the party doing the act. Undue inﬂuence may be any fraudulent or designing means
employed upon and with the maker of a will by which, under the circumstances and
conditions by which such maker was surrounded, he could not well resist and which
controlled his volition and induced him to do that which otherwise he would not have
done.
ANSWER TO INTERROGATORY NO. 2:
Answer “Yes” or “No”

Glossary of terms and symbols
A. Terms
Throughout this book, we have introduced and used terms that embody concepts
in the ﬁelds of evidence and logic. Many of the terms regularly used in discourse
about the law of evidence are also employed in discourse about logic and the logic of
proof, terms such as relevance, material facts, and probative value. Other terms are
primarily used in the study of logic and may not be familiar even to those who have
studied the law of evidence, terms such as catenate inferences, cognitive competence,
conjunction, and convergence. Finally, there are terms that relate primarily to the
studyofproofinanadjudicativesettingandhavespecialmeaningsforthoseinvolved
in that ﬁeld, terms such as theory of a case, story, and theme.
The purpose of this glossary is to provide students with basic deﬁnitions of the
main terms used in this book that may be unfamiliar. Most of these terms embody
concepts that require careful analysis and elucidation. To the extent required, we
havedevelopedtheseconceptsinthetext.Someofthesetermsembodycontroversial
concepts, and there may be disagreement about their precise meaning. For these, we
have chosen the meaning that facilitates the points developed here and have simply
stipulated that to be the meaning of the term as used in this book.
Studentsshouldbearinmindthat,toserveitsintendedpurpose,thedeﬁnitionsin

necessary to a full understanding of the concepts the terms express. As a reminder
and further aid, we have parenthetically identiﬁed the pages where the more novel
or difﬁcult terms are discussed and developed in the text. Students may also wish to
consult standard texts or treatises on the law of evidence for further ampliﬁcation
of some of the terms deﬁned here.
Abductivereasoning.
Acreativeprocessofusingknowndatatogeneratehypothe-
ses to be tested by further investigation.
Accuracy.
Also termed sensitivity. An attribute of the credibility of certain kinds
of tangible evidence such as those provided by sensing devices and tabled
information.

Glossary of terms and symbols
Ancillary evidence.
Evidence about other evidence and its probative strength;
also termed indirectly relevant evidence. Such evidence acts either to increase or
to reduce the strength of links in chains of reasoning set up by directly relevant
evidence (q. v.).
Authenticity.
An attribute of the credibility of tangible evidence referring to
whether a tangible item is what it is represented to be.
Autoptic proference.
Literally, evidence that will be perceived by the tribunal
through one of its senses. Wigmore used the term for what is conventionally
referred to as “real evidence,” a term which he considered ambiguous. In this
book it is used to include testimonial assertions the tribunal will hear, as well as
other evidence it will perceive with its senses.
Bias.
A term commonly used with reference to witnesses who provide testimonial
evidence. The term usually refers to the extent to which a witness’s interests,
incentives, or stakes may inﬂuence what this witness observed or reported. There
are several different kinds of bias that may inﬂuence a witness’s observations,
objectivity, and veracity.
Catenate inferences.
A series of inferences forming a chain; inferences upon
inferences.
Circumstantial evidence.
Circumstantial evidence is evidence that makes the
existence of a penultimate probandum more or less probable “indirectly,” in that
at least one further inferential step is involved. In legal usage sometimes con-
trasted loosely with testimonial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is the most
common kind of evidence in legal proceedings. Subject to the rules of admissi-
bility it can be relevant, valid, and of probative value. It is a common error to
treat circumstantial evidence as inferior to testimonial or real evidence.
Cognitivecompetence.
Ability to know and understand information on the basis
of the general stock of knowledge in a given society. In the logic of proof, it is
generally assumed that nearly all adult members of society are capable of drawing
upon a shared common stock of knowledge and applying ordinary principles of
practical reasoning.
Cognitive consensus.
The idea that there is a generally shared “stock of knowl-
edge” in a given society, commonly reﬂected by common sense generalizations
or generally known facts of which a tribunal will take judicial notice or the like.
Combination.
A logical process by which judgments about the probability that
individual elements of a compound proposition are true are combined into a
judgmentabouttheprobabilitythatthecompoundpropositionasawholeistrue.
Whether and by what process individual judgments may properly be combined
is the subject of serious controversy and theoretical debate. Cf. Conjunction,
Probability.

Conﬂicting evidence.
Evidence about events that can occur jointly but which
favor different probanda or propositions. For example, evidence about one event
may favor proposition P while evidence about another event may favor propo-
sition not-P.
Conjunction.
The combination of judgments about the probability of individual
facts in issue into a single judgment about the case as a whole. “The problem of
conjunction” refers to the contested issue whether legal standards of proof apply
to the ultimate probandum (a compound proposition) and the case as a whole
or to individual penultimate probanda (material facts) separately.
Contradictory evidence.
Evidence about two or more events that are mutually
exclusive, i.e. they cannot occur jointly. For example, one evidence item says
that event E occurred and another evidence item says that event E did not
occur.
Convergence.
Two inferences converge when they combine together to support
or negate an interim or penultimate probandum.
Corroboration.
Literally, strengthening, as when two witnesses independently
testify to the truth of the same proposition (cf. convergence). The term is used
in at least two senses: (1) to signify the production of an additional witness or
two, duplicating the assertion of a prior witness; or (2) to signify the auxiliary
evidential facts offered by a proponent to negative the explanations by which the
opponent seeks to weaken the inference from some original evidentiary fact of
the proponent. In the latter aspect, “corroboration” involves not a new logical
process, but a new stage in the presentation of evidence.
Credential [of evidence].
A term used to describe a property of evidence that
needs to be established or justiﬁed. Three major credentials of evidence are:
relevance, credibility, and probative force.
Credibility.
Concerns the extent to which an item of evidence or a source of
evidence may be believed. On occasion, this term is wrongly equated with the
term reliability [q.v.], which has a more restricted deﬁnition. As a credential of
evidence, credibility or believability has several different attributes that depend
upon the form of evidence, whether it is tangible or testimonial.
Credibility attributes [for tangible evidence].
These attributes are: authenticity,
accuracy, and reliability.
Credibility attributes [for testimonial evidence].
These attributes are: veracity,
objectivity, and observational sensitivity.
Deductive argument.
The form of argument in which a major premise is applied
to a minor premise to establish that a conclusion is valid. In evidential reasoning,
the major premise may be a proposition of law or, more often, a generalization.

382
Glossary of terms and symbols
Direct evidence.
In legal usage the term is ambiguous: it is sometimes used in
contrast with circumstantial evidence (q.v.) or with hearsay (q.v.) or with ancil-
lary evidence, which is indirectly relevant (q.v.). In a narrow sense it refers to
testimony from a witness who states that she actually saw, heard, or otherwise
experienced a material fact in issue (e.g., “I saw X cause Y’s death”).
Directly relevant evidence.
Evidence is said to be directly relevant if a defensible
chain of reasoning can be constructed that links this evidence with a major
proposition whose proof is at issue.
Discovery.
This term is used in two different ways in applications in law. The
ﬁrst, called investigative discovery, refers to the evidence, hypotheses, and argu-
ments generated by an attorney or other enquirer during fact investigation. The
other, called legal discovery, refers to the legally sanctioned process of obtaining
evidence from a usually unwilling opponent. In England the latter is now called
“disclosure.”
Eliminative induction.
A method of proof in which a variety of evidential tests
are employed in an effort to eliminate alternative hypotheses being considered.
The hypothesis that best resists our attempts to eliminate any hypothesis is the
one that can be taken most seriously.
Epistemology.
A branch of philosophy concerning the acquisition of and validity
of knowledge.
Evidence.
Any facts considered by the tribunal as data to persuade them to reach
a reasoned belief on a probandum. The term is sometimes used to refer to
evidential data or autoptic proferences and sometimes to refer to other facts
taken as established for purposes of argument.
Evidence and events.
There is an important distinction to be made between evi-
dence of some event and the event itself. Having evidence that an event occurred
does not entail that this event did occur. What is at issue is the credibility of the
evidence and its source(s).
Evidential data.
See autoptic proference.
Evidentiary fact.
See factum probans.
Fact.
Any event or act or condition of things, assumed (for the moment) as having
happened or having existed.
Fact of consequence.
An important probandum. The term is slightly wider than
material facts in that it refers to probanda undermining or reinforcing the cred-
ibility of evidence as well as to ultimate and penultimate probanda.

Glossary of terms and symbols
383
Facts in issue.
Material facts or facts constituting the elements of an ultimate
probandum; not necessarily disputed facts, for some elements of an ultimate
probandum may not be a matter of contention between the parties. “A fact-in-
issue is a fact as to the correctness of which the tribunal, under the law of the case,
must be persuaded” (J. Wigmore (1935) 7). Exceptionally, a fact in issue may be
one of a set of jointly sufﬁcient conditions rather than a necessary condition for
success in a case: for example, one of a series of defenses, any one of which is
sufﬁcient to exonerate a defendant in a civil or criminal case (e.g., self-defense or
insanity in a criminal case or fair comment or qualiﬁed privilege in a defamation
action).
Factum probandum.
A proposition to be proved. See probandum; compare inter-
mediate probandum, penultimate probandum, and ultimate probandum.
Factum probans.
Evidencing the proposition to be proved: A factual proposition
offered as support for a further inferred proposition, i.e. a factum probandum.
Generalization.
A general proposition claimed to be true which is used implicitly
or explicitly to argue that a conclusion has been established. All or almost all
inductive arguments can be translated into syllogistic form by articulating as a
universal the assumed generalization which provides the basis for the induction
claimed.
Hearsay.
A statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at
trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.
Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).
Hypothesis.
A general proposition put forward as a possible explanation for
known facts from which additional investigations can be planned to generate
evidential data that will tend to strengthen or weaken the basis for accepting
the proposition as the best or strongest explanation of the available data.
Inductive argument.
An argument that one proposition (taken as established),
a factum probans, makes another proposition in the case, a factum probandum,
more or less probable than it otherwise would be. The argument is frequently by
analogy and almost always rests upon an assumed generalization upon whose
acceptance the strength of the argument depends.
Inference.
“The process of thought, by which we reason from evidence toward
proof . . . ” J. Wigmore (1935).
Inference upon inference.
See catenate inferences.
Interim probandum.
A proposition to be proved which itself will tend to support
or negate, directly or indirectly, an ultimate probandum as part of a chain of
inferences. Such a proposition is a factum probandum in relation to propositions

Glossary of terms and symbols
offered as supporting it and a factum probans in relation to propositions for
which it is offered as support.
Judicial notice.
“A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable
dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction
of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort
to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.” Fed. R. Evid.
201(a).
Marshaling.
Refers to the bringing together of thoughts and evidence during
fact investigation and argument construction. Having useful strategies for
marshaling thus helps advance the processes of fact investigation and of proof.
Marshaling magnets.
New hypotheses or probanda are frequently generated by
considering combinations of existing information. A marshaling “magnet” is a
metaphoric description of evidence marshaling operations that serve to attract
particular combinations of evidence from some collection of data or triﬂes and
that can assist in generating new hypotheses or probanda or that can open up
new lines of inquiry and evidence.
Material facts.
See ultimate probandum, facts in issue, and penultimate pro-
banda.
Penultimate probanda.
Simple propositions, each of which state one element of
a crime or claim or defense that must be established in order for the proponent
to prevail. The penultimate probanda in a case can be derived from the ultimate
probandum or probanda for the case and represent the decomposing of a
compound proposition into simple propositions identifying each of its essential
components. For most purposes, each of the penultimate probanda is a material
fact or a fact in issue.
Probability.
“The word ‘probable’ as used in everyday discourse describes a
state of affairs which we do not know for certain to be the case, but which
we are well inclined to believe . . .” In its more technical usage, the term
“probability” denotes a quantitative measure of the uncertainty associated
with some unknown state of affairs – or, as it is technically called, “event.”
(See Dawid, appendix.) Differing conceptions of probability are a matter of
considerable controversy and debate within statistics and the logic of proof.
Probandum.
Literally, a proposition to be proved. An ultimate probandum is
a proposition which must be proved to some speciﬁed degree by the party
asserting it in order to succeed in the case, i.e., the material facts or facts in
issue. See also factum probandum, interim probandum, penultimate probanda,
and ultimate probandum.
Probative force or value.
A term denoting a judgment about (a) the importance

degree to which that data might alter the probability that the fact of consequence
was or was not true. Probative value is the term usually employed in assessing
the signiﬁcance of speciﬁed evidential data for determining whether it should be
admitted notwithstanding otherwise improper prejudicial effects the data may
have. In contrast, “weight” is the term ordinarily employed in assessing the extent
towhichthewholeoftheevidenceinacaseestablishestheultimateprobandumor
probanda to the degree of certainty required by the applicable standard of proof.
Proof.
“The persuasive operation of the total mass of evidentiary facts, as to a
probandum.” (Wigmore (1937) 9.) See, further, Standard of proof.
Proposition.
A statement that is true or false, that can be afﬁrmed or denied.
Quantitative rules.
Rules that require certain kinds of evidence to be produced
in speciﬁed quantity (e.g., “corroborated”).
Quantum of evidence.
The amount of evidence; see also quantitative rules.
Real evidence.
Typically, physical evidence presented to the fact-ﬁnder. See
autoptic proference.
Redundancy.
Applied to evidence, this term refers to evidence that either says
the same thing over again or does not add anything to what we already have. (In
law, the term cumulative is often used with reference to redundant evidence.)
Relevance.
“Relevant evidence” means evidence having any tendency to make
the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the
action more probable or less probable than it would have been without the
evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 401.
Reliability.
A reliable process is one that is repeatable or consistent. The term
is usually applied to devices and tests of various kinds. This term is often used
incorrectly as a synonym for the term credibility or believability, which involves
other attributes.
Simple proposition.
A proposition that makes only one point: for example, “It
was X who murdered Y” as contrasted with “X murdered Y.” As a rule of thumb
nearly all items on a key-list should be simple propositions.
Standard for decision.
The generic term for the standard that an ofﬁcial or
functionary is required or expected to apply in respect of a given decision. For
example, the standard that a prosecuting authority has to satisfy with respect to a
decisiontoprosecute.Standardsofproofareonespeciesofstandardsfordecision.
Standard of proof.
The degree of persuasion required for the proponent to
establish a particular fact in issue (or, possibly, the case as a whole). The
standard of proof in civil cases is typically “the preponderance of the evidence”
or “the balance of probabilities.” In criminal cases the prosecution has to

Glossary of terms and symbols
satisfy the standard of “beyond reasonable doubt” in order to succeed. In some
non-criminal cases, the standard of proof is said to be “clear and convincing.”
There is controversy as to whether the standard of proof applies independently
to each fact in issue or, by conjunction, to the probability of the facts in issue in
respect of the case as a whole (the problem of conjunction).
Story.
“A narrative of particular events arranged in a time sequence and forming
a meaningful totality.” Rethinking 223 (adapted from Ricoeur).
Substance-blind.
A term used to describe a particular way of categorizing forms
and combinations of evidence without regard to its substance or content. Such
a categorization is based on the inferential properties of evidence and not on its
content.
Tangible evidence.
Evidence that can be directly examined by persons drawing
conclusions to see what event(s) this evidence reveals. Examples include objects,
documents, images, measurements, and charts.
Testimonial evidence.
Evidence provided by a human source to the evaluator
of the evidence. Testimonial evidence about some event can be based on direct
observations, secondhand reports from another source, or on the basis of
opinion or inferences based on information about the occurrence of other
events. In law: evidence given by a competent witness under oath or afﬁrmation
and in the presence of the tribunal.
Theme.
An element in an argument that is considered sufﬁciently important by
the person presenting the argument to deserve emphasis by repetition.
Theory of a case.
An overall strategic argument concerning the case as a whole,
typically used by an advocate or judge to structure the argument and guide
choices on particular aspects of it.
Ultimateprobandum.
The proposition of fact that the proponent (the party with
the burden of proof) must establish or negate in order to prevail in the case.
Viewing the rule of law that governs the case as a major premise, the ultimate
probandum is the minor premise that, if all of its elements were proved, would
compel the conclusion that its proponent urges. In a case in which the prose-
cution or a plaintiff alleges separate crimes or claims or in which a defendant
alleges an afﬁrmative defense upon which she has the burden of proof, there
may be more than one ultimate probandum, i.e. multiple ultimate probanda.
Warrant.
A term used in argument construction to refer to the grounds or
license for linking one proposition to another in a chain of reasoning. Warrants
and their backing by ancillary evidence are said to form the “glue” holding an
argument together. See also Generalization.
Weight.
See Probative force or value.

Glossary of terms and symbols
387
B. Symbols
The modiﬁed Wigmorean charting system or palette presented in this book requires
only eight symbols. Five are likely to be required for any chart:
(1) the square for depicting testimonial assertions;
⃝
(2) the circle for depicting circumstantial evidence or inferred proposi-
tions;
<
(3) the open angle to identify an argument that provides an alternative
explanation for an inference proposed by the other side;
◁
(4) a vertical triangle to identify an argument that corroborates a proposed
inference;
→
↑
(5) a line to indicate the “direction” of a proposed inferential relation-
ship between or among propositions – vertical line indicates “tends
to support”; horizontal lines indicate “tends to negate or weaken.”
The direction from evidential data to asserted inferences is always up,
from bottom to top. Directional arrows are only occasionally necessary
where the line standing alone might be misunderstood.
The nature of a judicial trial makes it necessary to have symbols to identify the
kinds of evidential data or the source of the propositions the tribunal will be asked
to take as the basis for the arguments advanced. Wigmore speciﬁed two, and we
have found a third useful:
∞
(6) an inﬁnity symbol to identify testimonial assertions that the fact-
ﬁnders will hear or other autoptic proferences they will perceive with
their other senses;
¶
(7) a paragraph symbol to identify facts the tribunal will judicially notice
or otherwise accept without evidential support; and
G
(8) theletter“G”todenoteageneralizationthatislikelytoplayasigniﬁcant
role in an argument in a case, but that is not a proposition that will be
supported by evidence or that the tribunal will be formally asked to
notice judicially.
