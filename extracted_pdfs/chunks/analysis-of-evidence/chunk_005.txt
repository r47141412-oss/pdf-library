to be tested, the propositions to be proved, and formal rules regulate the manner
in which cases are prepared and the admissibility and use of evidence.
In recent years, the study of evidence has gained a high proﬁle. In popular ﬁction,
lawyer-novelists have sometimes outsold writers of traditional crime ﬁction. On
television, as well as in bookstores, forensic scientists have joined the ranks of
detectives through the works of Patricia Cornwell and programs, such as “Crime
SceneInvestigation” (CBS television, 2003– ). In recentyears,internationalcriminal
tribunals and truth and reconciliation commissions have proliferated, raising new
problemsaboutevidenceandstorytelling.EventsinEasternEurope,Rwanda,South
Africa, and Latin America have stimulated an enormous interest in “memory,”
especially among historians.2 DNA is in the headlines regularly. In England several
policeauthoritieshavebeenwonovertoFLINTS(ForensicLedIntelligenceSystem),
a computer-based tool for investigating multiple crimes, and making links between
crimes that were not previously thought to be connected.3 Evidence was a primary
focus of attention in news about Iraq: the weapons inspections, Colin Powell’s
presentation to the Security Council, the question of links with Al Qaeda, the search
for “weapons of mass destruction,” and the investigations of the Commission on
Terrorism into the tragic events of September 11, 2001 (“9/11”).
Perhaps the strongest stimulus came from the terrorist attacks on 9/11. In the
postmortem after the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the
Pentagon in Washington, D.C., it has been repeatedly alleged that the events could
have been predicted because the US intelligence services had received several bits of
informationbuttheyfailed“toconnectthedots”(orwhatSherlockHolmesreferred
to as “triﬂes”). They had enough information to have predicted the event, but lacked
the capacity to collate and analyze it. They did not have the capacity to “connect the
dots” or methods for identifying as signiﬁcant a few triﬂes from the masses of data
that ﬂowed into different agencies from a variety of sources. This diagnosis led to
a reorganization of the intelligence services, changes in their training, and billions
of dollars spent (or misspent) on efforts to develop computer programs aimed at
assisting the process of analyzing intelligence data. The problems were encapsulated
in the satirical cartoon shown in Figure 2.1.
An article in The New Yorker in February 20034 reported interviews with leading
ﬁgures in the CIA and the Pentagon who are concerned with improving intelligence
analysis in the aftermath of 9/11. They included Donald Rumsfeld, George Tenet,
and Robert Gates. The starting-point was a judgment that American intelligence
agencies did not possess the analytic depth or the right methods of analysis accu-
rately to assess possible threats. The diagnosis and the prescriptions were expressed
largely in terms that are familiar to students of evidence and inference: the dangers
of a commitment to a single hypothesis; the need to distinguish between generating
ahypothesisandtestingitagainsttheavailabledata;thedifferentproblemsthatarise

Analysis of Evidence

from a surfeit of information and absence of relevant and credible evidence; the
difference between ambiguity and incompleteness; the value of alternative interpre-
tations of ambiguous evidence; the dangers of “mirror imaging,” that is “projecting
of American values and beliefs onto America’s adversaries and rivals”; a tendency
to confuse the unfamiliar with the improbable; the relationship between a calculus
of risk and thresholds of credibility; the likelihood of political bias entering into
judgments where the situation is uncertain. These and other problems have been

sometimes different, all of these ideas should be familiar to students of evidence and
inference; some of them seem to be derived, directly or indirectly, from Wigmore
(1913, 1937) and Schum (1994).
The information that may have been available before 9/11 illustrates some of the
difﬁculties associated with the task of “connecting the dots.” Before the terrorists
used airplanes as ﬂying bombs to destroy the World Trade Center and damage the
Pentagon, the FBI had received information that several foreign nationals from the
Mideast, with little or no prior training or experience, had enrolled in different
civilian ﬂying schools to learn how to ﬂy large commercial aircraft. It was widely
reported that they wanted to learn how to steer and navigate civilian airliners, but

not how to make landings or takeoffs in these aircraft, and that they had all paid
cash for the lessons.5 Assuming that these were the facts that had been reported,
how might the FBI dots have been connected?
With the wisdom of hindsight, it was clear that the FBI dots, the training requests
made by the foreign nationals who sought ﬂying lessons, were signiﬁcant informa-
tion that was available before 9/11. Suppose that a well-trained analyst had focused
on these dots because of an intuition that they were suspicious. She might have
thought about this information by asking and answering the following questions:
1 Identifying the reasons for suspicion. This seems suspicious: Why? Answer: because:
a A trained pilot of any aircraft needs to know how to take off and land;
b Several foreign nationals all doing something unusual in the same time may be
acting in a coordinated way and belong to the same organization(s) or
group(s);
c A person who pays substantial sums of money using cash, rather than a credit card,
check, or bank transfer, may be trying to conceal his identity or the source of the
funds. Several people doing this simultaneously for the same type of transaction is
even more suspicious. The analyst might have identiﬁed additional reasons for
suspicion, but the reasons identiﬁed would have provided a sufﬁcient basis for the
next step.
2 Generating hypotheses. Why might someone want to be able to ﬂy and navigate a
commercial airliner, but not to land or take off?
a Innocent hypotheses.
i They plan to learn to land and take off later. This is Part I of an unusual
training scheme;
ii Flying an aircraft is simulated in many video games and these “students” wish
to design more realistic games;
iii An airline is training non-pilot staff to relieve pilots on long haul ﬂights.
b Sinister hypotheses.
iv The ﬂights these persons will be on board are for carrying drugs (or other
contraband). They do not want to disclose the aircraft’s destination to the pilot
until the plane is almost there;
v The “students” plan to hijack one or more civilian airliners and the hijackers
wish to control the ﬂying and navigation prior to landing, but will force the
pilot(s) to land at their chosen destination(s);
5 These reports are contested. Staff investigators of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks
Upon the United States reported that, “According to their ﬂight instructors [in San Diego] Hamzi
and Mihdhar [two al Qaeda terrorists] said they wanted to learn how to control an aircraft in ﬂight,
but took no interest in take-offs or landings.” Staff Statement No. 16, “Outine of 9/11 Plot” (2004)
at 14. In an earlier statement, they implied that the FBI did not have this information before 9/11.
“Contrary to popular belief, Zacarias Moussaoui [the alleged twentieth hijacker] did not say he
was not interested in learning how to take off and land. Instead, he stood out because, with little
knowledge of ﬂying, he wanted to learn how to take off and land a Boeing 747.” Staff Statement
No. 10, “Threats and Responses in 2001” (2004). See “Post 9/11 investigations: an exercise” below
at pp. 52–53 for a fuller account.

Analysis of Evidence
vi It is not intended that the planes should land because they will be blown up in
midair;
vii It is not intended that the airliners should land, because they will be used as
“ﬂying bombs” directed at speciﬁc targets on an analogy with suicide bombers.
The list needs to be kept open in case other possible hypotheses are suggested as the
inquiry develops, but the hypotheses identiﬁed are sufﬁcient to enable the analysts to
proceed.
3 Eliminating some hypotheses. Hypotheses i and ii are the least plausible, given the
number of “students,” the secrecy, and the departure from international regulations.
Moreover, hypotheses i, ii, and iii could easily be checked. Fairly simple inquiries to
determine the identity and background of the students and whether any foreign
or domestic airlines had adopted training programs such as those identiﬁed in
hypotheses i and iii should have enabled the analyst to determine whether they could
be eliminated at this stage. The identities of the students and their backgrounds should
have enabled the analyst to determine whether hypothesis ii could be eliminated.
4 Prioritizing the remaining hypotheses. On the basis of this information alone, the
analyst might have provisionally ranked hypotheses iv–vii in terms of seriousness,
plausibility, and easiness to check. For example, hypothesis vi is very serious, but it is
implausible because it is not necessary for hijackers to take control of a plane in order
to blow it up, unless it is planned to blow it up near a target (see hypothesis vii).
Hypothesis iv merits investigation, but in terms of the consequences, it is less serious
than the remainder.6 Moreover, that hypothesis ought to have been relatively easy to
pursue (and perhaps eliminate) through checks on the identity of the “students” and
their associates and through information available to the FBI and to customs and
drug enforcement agencies about the use of aircraft in transporting drugs (or other
contraband).
The size of the group, the seriousness of the danger, and the relative plausibility
of the scenario, given this information, should have suggested to the analyst that
hypothesis vii deserves the highest priority, but that hypothesis v also needed to
be pursued as a matter of urgency. Of course, the possibility of further hypotheses
must be kept open. In focusing on hypothesis vii, there would have been some fairly
obvious ﬁrst lines of inquiry: for example, to what group(s) or organizations(s) do
the students belong? Is there any information about the capabilities and intentions
of these group(s) or organization(s)? What might be the targets of such attacks?
What might be the timing? And so on. The evidence discovered in pursuing the ﬁrst
6 Prior to 9/11, the FBI probably would have focused its resources on hypothesis iv. Throughout
its history, the bureau has focused upon post-event investigations to develop criminal cases. The
incentive structure rewarded agents based upon statistics reﬂecting arrests, indictments, and prose-
cutions. Control over cases was in the ﬁeld ofﬁces, not FBI headquarters. These and other practices
had established a law enforcement culture that constricted the bureau’s ability to gather and share
informationandtousethatinformationforstrategicanalysisforterrorismprevention.SeeNational
Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Staff Statement No. 9, “Law Enforce-
ment, Counterterrorism, and Intelligence Collection in the United States Prior to 9/11.” That
culture was deeply ingrained and resistant to change. See also Staff Statement No. 12, “Reforming
Law Enforcement, Counterterrorism, and Intelligence Collection in the United States.”

COMBINATIONS OF DOTS OR TRIFLES:
A COMBINATORIAL EXPLOSION
Given N dots/trifles, there are 2N –{N+1} possible 
combinations of two or more of them.

Figure 2.2 Possible combinations of two or more dots/triﬂes
two lines of inquiry should have enabled the analyst to re-evaluate the plausibility
of hypothesis v. Meanwhile, preventive action might have been taken in respect of
these “students” before their courses ended.
This exampleshows that even a single potentially signiﬁcant piece of information
can be used to generate hypotheses, and to eliminate some, through a combination
of imaginative reasoning and background knowledge. Each potentially plausible
hypothesis can then be used to generate lines of inquiry, speciﬁc questions, and
to serve as a metaphoric “magnet” for generating other information, which may
or may not be already available. However, this report was quite unusual because a
piece of isolated information (more accurately a small number of related dots) was
sufﬁcient to arouse suspicion, focus attention, and be usable to generate hypotheses.
It is much more common that an analyst must sift through large numbers of dots,
each of which may seem trivial or insigniﬁcant on its own, seeking combinations
whose signiﬁcance is greater than the sum of the individual parts.
There are three basic problems inherent in the task of “connecting the dots.”
First, we must decide which dots to connect. The number of possible combinations
grows exponentially as the number of dots. Figure 2.2 illustrates the difﬁculties
encountered in examining combinations of dots. For example, if there were just ﬁfty
dots, there would be more than a million billion [1.13(10)15] possible combinations
of two or more dots. In most instances there will be many more than ﬁfty dots to
connect; in some cases, there may be thousands or even millions of dots to consider.
Clearly, it makes no sense to examine all of these possible combinations, even if
we had the fastest conceivable computer. This would be a strategy of examining
everything in the hope of ﬁnding something. What we need are strategies for better
using our imaginations in deciding which dots to combine. The questions posed in
the example above provide an example of such a strategy.

Analysis of Evidence
Second, combining dots or triﬂes involves more than just combining single items
of information or details. Other dots come in the form of thoughts the analyst has
about the meaning or signiﬁcance of these informational details. Connecting the
dots involves combining thoughts as well as potential items of evidence. Third,
the analyst must decide what the identiﬁable combinations of evidential dots and
her thoughts about them might mean. Connecting these dots makes it possible to
generate hypotheses, but this process is also involved in constructing defensible and
persuasive arguments about hypotheses in light of the available evidence.
Post 9/11 investigation: an exercise
According to statements prepared by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks
on the United States and other information published during post 9/11 investiga-
tions, agencies of the United States had the following information prior to 9/11.
1 The Federal Aviation Administration had information claiming that, in the 1990s,
associates of Usama Bin Ladin were interested in hijacking and using aircraft as a
weapon. Moreover, the FAA had considered the potential for terrorist suicide
hijackings in the United States not later than March 1998. There was, however, no
evidence indicating that the FAA possessed any credible and speciﬁc intelligence that
Usama Bin Ladin, Al Qaeda, or any other groups were actually plotting to hijack
commercial airplanes and use them as weapons of mass destruction. The FAA
discounted that threat in presentations that it made to air carriers in 2000 and 2001
because it had “no indication that any group is currently thinking in that direction.”
Staff Statement No. 3 at 4.
2 On July 10, 2001, the Phoenix ofﬁce of the FBI sent a report of a ﬁeld investigation
instituted in April 2000 whose purpose was “to advise the Bureau and the New York
ofﬁce [the ‘Ofﬁce of Origin’ for the FBI’s Al Qaeda program] of the possibility of a
coordinated effort by Usama Bin Ladin (UBL) to send students to the United States to
attend civil aviation universities and colleges.” The memorandum reported that an
“inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest” were or had attended civil
aviation universities and colleges in Arizona, including Zakaria Soubra, a “hardcore
Islamic extremist who views the U.S. as an enemy of Islam.” The Phoenix
memorandum made many recommendations, including a recommendation that
“FBIHQ should discuss this matter with other elements of the U.S. intelligence
community and task the community for any information that supports Phoenix’s
suspicions.”7
3 On August 15, 2001, the Minneapolis FBI ﬁeld ofﬁce initiated an investigation
concerning Zacarias Moussaoui. He had entered the country in February and had
taken ﬂying lessons at ﬂight school in Oklahoma. On August 13, he began ﬂight
7 A redacted copy of the Phoenix memorandum is reproduced in an appendix to the joint report of
the U.S. Senate and House Select Committees on Intelligence that conducted a joint inquiry into
intelligence activities before and after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (S. Rept. 107-351
and House Rept. No. 107-792).

training at the Pan American ﬂight training school in Minneapolis. He stood out
because, with little knowledge of ﬂying, he wanted to learn how to takeoff and land a
Boeing 747. On August 15, he was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service on the ground that he was a French national who had overstayed his visa
because the FBI agent who handled the case in conjunction with the INS
representative on the Minneapolis Joint Terrorism Task Force suspected that
Moussaoui wanted to hijack planes. The Minneapolis ofﬁce sent a summary of the
investigation to FBI headquarters on August 18, with a request to the legal attach´e in
Paris for assistance. The legal attach´e responded quickly. According to a letter sent by
Special Agent Rowley to FBI director Robert Mueller after the 9/11 attacks, the attach´e
advised that the French Intelligence had conﬁrmed Moussaoui’s afﬁliation with
radical fundamentalist Islamic groups and activities connected to Usama Bin Ladin.
(“The 9/11 Commission Report”) (2004) (the “9/11 Report”) at 273.
4 In September 1999, the Central Intelligence Agency received a report that it had
commissioned from the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress titled,
“The Sociology and Psychology of Terrorism: Who Becomes a Terrorist and Why?”
(the “CIA Report”). In the executive summary, the authors concluded that
“Al-Qaeda’s expected retaliation for the U.S. Cruise missile attack against al-Qaeda
training facilities in Afghanistan on August 28, 1998, could take several forms of
terrorist attack in the nation’s capital . . . Suicide bomber(s) belonging to an al-Qaeda
Martyrdom Battalion could crash land an aircraft packed with high explosives (C-4
and semtex) into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA), or the White House . . . ” CIA Report at 7. None of this information was treated
with urgency prior to 9/11.
Questions
1 Put yourself in the position of the hypothetical FBI analyst described above. It is
August, 2001. You have the information described in paragraphs 2 and 3 above.
Assuming the information excited your suspicions, how would you proceed? Would
your hypothesis have differed from those posed above? If so, how and why? What
further immediate investigative steps would you have recommended?
2 During the summer of 2001, the FAA, the FBI, and the CIA were aware that there was
a heightened risk that terrorists would undertake major attacks in the near future.
How would you have designed a system that might have brought all the dots noted
above into a single database? If you were an analyst with access to such a database,
what questions would you have asked that might have connected these dots?
3 Put yourself in the position of a CIA analyst in the summer of 2001. You recalled and
restudied the Library of Congress report and became concerned about the conclusion
that al Qaeda might use aircraft as suicide bombs. Using the four-step methodology
used by the hypothetical FBI agent, how would you have proceeded? What questions
would you have sent to the FBI and FAA and other intelligence agencies to generate
information to enable you to eliminate or support your priority hypothesis or
hypotheses?

Analysis of Evidence
4 Now assume that you had been a supervisory agent in the FBI. You were aware of the
generally heightened concern about terrorist threats and you had seen the Phoenix
memo and investigative summary sent by the Minneapolis ﬁeld ofﬁce. In your
capacity as supervising agent you received in late August 2001 the question you
submitted in your capacity as a CIA analyst. How would you have responded? What
additional actions by the FBI or other agencies would you have recommended?
Recognizing that the FBI had limited resources and a culture that tended to
“back-burner” investigative requests that were unrelated to the bureau’s crime-
solving culture, how would you have prioritized these requests? Had your superiors
declined to assign these requests the priority you thought they deserved, what if
anything do you now think that you would have done?
The examples based on 9/11 developed above illustrate three points that are
central to understanding evidence in general, as well as evidence in legal contexts.
i The ingredients of proof in law and in other contexts involve evidence, hypotheses,
propositions to be proved, possible explanations, and arguments linking evidence and
hypotheses. All of these ingredients must be generated as a result of imaginative
reasoning, also called abductive reasoning. Generation of these ingredients is a major
element of fact investigation. But the more familiar logical forms of reasoning,
deductive and inductive, are also required in the testing of hypotheses and in the
construction of arguments linking evidence and hypotheses. Computers can be of
help in locating and sorting data, but no program has been developed or is likely to be
developed to serve as a substitute for the imaginative reasoning possessed by human
beings.
ii Such reasoning activities cannot be productive in the absence of knowledge of the
major properties or “credentials” of evidence. These credentials – relevance,
credibility, and probative (inferential) force – have long been studied in the literature
on evidence in the ﬁeld of law. In fact, there is a rich legacy of knowledge about these
credentials that has accumulated in law and that could be taken to greater advantage
by persons in many other disciplines as well as by practicing lawyers. This legacy has
accumulated over the centuries largely as a result of repeated experiences in the
crucible of adversarial encounters in our Anglo-American adversarial system for
settling disputes.
iii Evidence varies substantively, or in terms of its content, in a nearly inﬁnite fashion
and comes from many different sources. There is a method, however, of classifying
forms of evidence that is substance-blind. This method allows us to study and analyze
evidence without regard to the content of the evidence.
All of these general aspects of the study of evidence are an essential part of
understanding evidence in legal and in other contexts. The next part deals with
fact investigation, preserving the metaphor of generating dots, triﬂes, or details
and ﬁnding potential explanations for those we generate during fact investigation.

Part C identiﬁes and explains the credentials of evidence. The last part explains the
importance of using the substance-blind form in examining evidence.8
B. Fact investigation: generating dots and explanations for them
One of the most important and difﬁcult tasks in the practice of law is fact inves-
tigation.9 Fact investigation involves the generation or discovery of the necessary
ingredients of the later process of proof during which the parties present their com-
petingviewsabout“thefacts”insomedispute.Theseingredientsincludehypotheses
or propositions to be proved, evidence, and arguments linking hypotheses and evi-
dence. Thus, fact investigation involves the analysis, as well as the gathering, of
evidence.
Fact investigation may also appropriately be termed fact inquiry because a crucial
ingredient of fact investigation is the asking of questions. Fact investigation, as an
ongoing process, is a dynamic activity; it takes place over time, and every episode
is unique. The investigator learns different things at different times in response to
questionssheasks.Asfactinvestigationproceeds,theinvestigatoroftenhashypothe-
ses in search of evidence and, at the same time, evidence in search of hypotheses.
Knowing what questions she should be asking at any given time is rarely obvious,
except in hindsight. Often, the most productive questions cannot be asked until she
obtains answers to many other questions that may not seem important at the time
they are asked.
In contrast, analysis is static. It is necessary at all stages of the process, but it is
episodic rather than continuous. The investigator analyzes the then available data
and hypotheses to reﬁne the hypotheses (or generate new ones) and to determine
whether and how the investigation should be directed or redirected. Given the
analysis done, what further questions need to be addressed?
1. Types of logical reasoning and justiﬁcation
Fact investigation in law shares many attributes that characterize discovery-related
activities in other contexts such as science, history, medicine, and intelligence anal-
ysis. In any context, investigation and analysis (and proof) require the use of the
three standard forms of logic: deductive, inductive, and abductive. Arguments in
8 A note on terminology: Lawyers are familiar with terms such as direct evidence, circumstantial
evidence, real evidence, discovery, and corroboration, which have acquired technical legal meanings
and have sometimes been the subject of controversy. These terms have different meanings when
they are used by logicians, probabilists, newspaper reporters, and others. As this book is about the
logic of proof, we have adopted deﬁnitions for a few terms (direct, circumstantial, corroboration)
that ﬁt this framework and which diverge from technical legal usage. For the sake of precision
we have also used a few terms that may be unfamiliar such as ancillary evidence, probandum, and
autoptic proference. All of these terms are deﬁned in the Glossary.
9 The term is taken from the title of a book on fact investigation by Binder and Bergman (1984).

Analysis of Evidence
each of these forms can be expressed in the form of a syllogism. In deductive logic,
the major premise must be a statement that is universally true:
Deductive:
All As are Bs
X is an A
X is [necessarily] a B.
In inductive logic, in the sense of practical reasoning, the major premise is not
universally true and ordinarily not stated. It is a generalization, a proposition, that
may be true “usually,” “many times,” “more often than not,” “sometimes,” etc. It can
however, be expressed in syllogistic form by articulating the generalization upon
which an inference depends.
Inductive:
Many As are Bs
X is an A
X is probably a B
Abductive reasoning is discussed in detail in the next section. It is the creative
process of reasoning. Rather than reasoning from a hypothesis to a conclusion
based upon the evidence, it involves reasoning from the evidence to a hypothesis
that might explain it.
Abductive:
Surprising event A has occurred
If H were true, A would follow
There is reason to believe that H might be true.
The applications of these forms of logic are described and illustrated in the
materials that follow. For now, it is important to recognize that in legal and most
other practical contexts a conclusion based upon the evidence can only be justiﬁed
as rational through the use of one or more of these forms of logic.
2. Abductive reasoning and the generation of a new idea
In any context, investigation or discovery involves imaginative or creative thought.
For many centuries it was assumed that the generation of hypotheses and new ideas
involved some species of inductive reasoning. It was not until the late 1800s that
questions arose regarding whether new ideas can arise by purely inductive means.
It is one thing to justify some hypothesis inductively, based on evidence. But it is
quite another thing to say how this hypothesis arose in the ﬁrst place.
This distinction was considered carefully by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914).
Peirce argued that new ideas could not be generated by deductive reasoning, which
shows that something is necessarily true. The price paid for necessity in such an
argument is the absence of new information, since a deductive conclusion contains
nothing that is not already included in its premises. Peirce also argued that new
ideas cannot arise strictly on the basis of inductive reasoning. Such reasoning shows
that some hypothesis is probably true, based on evidence. But this form of reasoning
is involved in the justiﬁcation of a known hypothesis and does not explain how the

Figure 2.3 A modiﬁed arch of knowledge
hypothesis was generated or discovered in the ﬁrst place. Peirce argued that there
must be another form of reasoning associated with discovery and the generation
of hypotheses or possible explanations. He termed this third form of reasoning
abduction, by means of which we show that something is possibly or plausibly true.
Peirce associated abductive reasoning with ﬂashes of insight (Peirce (1903) 304):
The abductive suggestion comes to us like a ﬂash. It is an act of insight, although of
extremely fallible insight. It is true that the different elements of the hypothesis were in
ourmindsbefore;butitistheideaofputtingtogetherwhatwehadneverbeforedreamed
of putting together which ﬂashes the new suggestion before our contemplation.
Peirce went on to put abductive reasoning in the following syllogistic form:
The surprising fact E1 is observed;
But if hypothesis H were true, E1 would be a matter of course,
Thus, there is reason to suspect that H might be true.
Theabductiveprocessisgraphicallyillustratedinthemodiﬁedarchofknowledge
shown in Figure 2.3.10 Peirce’s abductive syllogism deﬁnes the upward arm. The
downward arm can be similarly expressed in syllogistic form.
If H were true, then one or more of facts E2, E3, and E4 ought to exist.
Assume H is true.
Thus, there is reason to believe that one or more of facts E2, E3, and E4 exist.
10 Philosopher David Oldroyd (1986) developed the original arch of knowledge. As here, he used
it as a metaphor to describe the process of investigation and discovery. We have modiﬁed it to
make clear how the arch can be used to describe the reasoning involved in fact investigation and

Analysis of Evidence
The value of a new hypothesis to an investigator rests not only on its ability
to explain evidence she already has; it may also allow her to generate new lines of
inquiry that have not been suggested by other hypotheses she had been entertaining.
The abductive process is not static. As a result of exploring the lines of inquiry
suggested by H1 or through other inquiries the investigator may discover new facts
that require that H1 be revised or eliminated. For example, the items of evidence,
E2, E3, and E4, that ought to have existed if H1 were true may not exist (or may
not be found). In other words, H1 has failed this test. Instead, her inquiries may
lead to the discovery of new items of evidence that makes it necessary to revise
H1. So too, new lines of inquiry suggested by H1 may result in observations that
suggest a new hypothesis, H2, different from H1. What we have to imagine are
sequences of arches laid side by side as we generate more possible explanations or
hypotheses.
A second difﬁculty with Figure 2.3 involves the nature of the linkage between the
initial observation and the hypothesis that the investigator generated to explain this
observation. If the analyst is asked to show how some new hypothesis H1 explains
E1, the phenomenon that allowed her to generate it, she encounters the necessity for
constructing an often elaborate argument or chain of reasoning from her observa-
tion to this new hypothesis H.11 For that reason, fact investigation activities always
involve mixtures of abductive, inductive, and deductive reasoning.
There is a direct connection between the theoretical matters we have just been
discussing and the practice of fact investigation in law. It happens that, at the same
time Peirce was developing his thoughts about abductive reasoning, across the
Atlantic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was developing the character of Sherlock Holmes.
There is no evidence that Peirce and Conan Doyle each knew of the other’s work.
Though Holmes describes his reasoning feats as “deductions,” it is clear that the
form of his reasoning was abductive in nature.12
3. Generating explanations for dots or triﬂes
The importance of considering dots or triﬂes has never been better illustrated than
in the exploits of Sherlock Holmes. In the Boscombe Valley Mystery, Holmes tells his
colleague Dr. Watson (Baring-Gould, 1967, Vol. II, 148), “It was by an examination
of the ground that I gained the triﬂing details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade,
as to the personality of the criminal.”
Watson says: “But how did you gain them?”

and 4.
12 A valuable account of the connections between Peirce’s abductive reasoning and Holmes’s inves-
tigative methods is the work of Umberto Eco and Thomas Sebeok (1983). Dr. Bell’s observations
about a new patient, Holmes’s determination that Watson had returned from Afghanistan, and
Kemelman’s “Nine mile walk” in Chapter 1 provide additional examples of Peirce’s abductive
reasoning and illustrate the mixture of reasoning forms that are commonly required.

Figure 2.4 Generating hypotheses from dots or triﬂes
Holmes replies: “You know my method. It is founded on the observance of
triﬂes.”
The “triﬂes” Holmes mentioned refer to any single dot or detail obtained during
fact investigation, whether it comes from a witness or from tangible evidence of
some sort.
In fact investigation, the number of triﬂes mounts up quickly as the process
unfolds. In either a criminal or civil case each question posed may lead the investi-
gator to a signiﬁcant number of triﬂes. Difﬁculties arise, as we illustrate in Figure 2.4
above, when she begins the process of trying to make sense out of a rapidly accu-
mulating collection of triﬂes. In this ﬁgure, each dot represents a triﬂe she has
collected.
As Figure 2.4 illustrates, on some occasions you might be fortunate in observing
a single triﬂe that may suggest a new hypothesis – for example, in a criminal inves-
tigation ﬁngerprints, DNA samples, shoe prints or other traces that can point to
a particular suspect (hypothesis). In most cases, however, the generation of a new
hypothesis or possibility is based upon a combination of several or many triﬂes. This
is where the difﬁculties arise. The number of triﬂe combinations increases exponen-
tially as the number of triﬂes gathered increases. The investigator as analyst must
determine which triﬂe combinations to examine. Prescribed methods for analyzing
the triﬂes and for marshaling the investigator’s or analyst’s thoughts become impor-
tant at this stage. The principles of logic and the ways they are applied in analyzing
evidence in a legal context are presented and illustrated in Chapter 3. Methods of

analysis that enable the analyst, be she an investigator or a lawyer preparing for trial,
are presented in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.13
C. On the credentials of evidence
There are three major characteristics or credentials of an evidential datum that must
beestablishedinanalyzingitsrelationshiptoahypothesis:Relevance,credibility,and
probative [inferential] force or weight. No triﬂe comes with these credentials already
established; these credentials rest upon arguments constructed by the analysts. For
that reason, we must ﬁrst consider the major ingredients of arguments.
1. Evidential foundations of argument
Arguments consist of evidence, hypotheses, and statements called generalizations
thatjustifylinkages between evidence and hypotheses.Metaphorically,anargument
isachainofreasoningfromevidencetohypotheses.Linksinthesechainscorrespond
to stages or steps in an argument. Each link exposes a source of possible doubt or
uncertainty.
In arguments based on evidence, there is a necessary distinction to be made
between evidence of some event and the event itself. In symbols, E∗represents
evidence (of some kind) about event E. Just because this evidence E∗says that event
E occurred does not entail that E did occur. In fact, from E∗the decision-maker can
only infer to some degree that event E did occur. For example, a witness Mary asserts
E∗, that she saw Harold let the air out of his boss’s tires last Monday. Just because
Mary makes this assertion does not mean that Harold did let the air out of his
boss’s tires (event E). Mary’s credibility is open to question. The same idea applies
to other forms of evidence. For example, Evidence E∗
2 in the form of a photograph
allegedly shows event E2, that Frank was in front of the bank shortly before it was
robbed on March 4, at 3 p.m. The decision-maker must be concerned about the
authenticity of this photo. This photo may have been doctored in various ways; it
may also have been taken on a different day at a different time. Issues of credibility
raise very important sources of doubt, but there are other doubts that arise when
we attempt to relate evidence to hypotheses or matters we are trying to prove.
In law a hypothesis is a proposition to be proved (a probandum). Probanda occur
at several different levels in an argument. A probandum is always a proposition that
in principle can be shown to be true or false. Levels of probanda in an argument
are illustrated in Figure 2.5.
In a legal case there will be a major or basic probandum at issue which we refer
to as the ultimate probandum. The rule of law that will be applied to determine
whether the plaintiff or the prosecutor is entitled to relief may be viewed as the
major premise. The ultimate probandum is the minor premise. If the evidence
13 Recent research suggests that how skillful we are at marshaling our existing thoughts and evidence
inﬂuences how skillful we will be in generating new hypotheses and new lines of inquiry and
evidence (Tillers and Schum (1991); Schum (1999)).

Figure 2.5 Levels of probanda in an argument
establishes that the ultimate probandum is true to the required degree of certainty,
then the verdict must be for the prosecution or the plaintiff. In criminal cases, for
example, an ultimate probandum includes all conditions that the prosecution must
prove to be true beyond reasonable doubt, in order to justify a conviction. So, in a
murder case, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt: that the victim
is dead; that it was an unlawful act that caused the victim’s death; that it was the
accused who committed that act; and that the accused had the intent required by
the law of the jurisdiction in which the murder occurred. In civil cases the ultimate
probandum consists of the ultimate facts the plaintiff must plead and prove in order
to prevail.
An ultimate probandum is either (rarely) a simple proposition or (usually) a
compound proposition that can be broken down into simple propositions, each of
which needs to be proved in order to prove the ultimate probandum. These simple
propositions are termed penultimate probanda. These penultimate probanda are
the material facts. The ﬁeld of law is unique in that the law deﬁnes the material facts
or the speciﬁc propositions or elements that are necessary and sufﬁcient to prove
some ultimate probandum.
The evidence E∗in Figure 2.5 is linked to penultimate probandum P1 by a chain
of reasoning indicated by propositions E, F, and G. Each of these propositions may
be true or false and thus represent a source of doubt interposed between evidence E∗
andpenultimateprobandumP1.Thesepropositionswerefertoasinterimprobanda.
All probanda, ultimate, penultimate, and interim, are potential sources of doubt or

uncertainty. This is what the term probandum indicates; they are all matters to be
proved.

P1.Thesegeneralizations,alsocalledwarrants (Toulmin,1964),supplyjustiﬁcations
for each reasoning link. Generalizations are commonly “if then” statements that
are inductive in nature; that is, they are hedged probabilistically in some way. For
example, consider generalization G2 in Figure 2.5 that licenses the inference of
proposition F from proposition E. This generalization might read: “If an event like
E occurs, then (usually, frequently, often) an event like F will occur.” For example,
assume that a police ofﬁcer testiﬁes in a narcotics case E∗that he observed person
X passing a small packet of white powder to person Y at this time and place. From
this evidence, the fact ﬁnder is asked to infer that X did pass a small packet of
white powder to person Y at this time and place. The applicable generalization on
which the inference is based might be stated as, “If a police ofﬁcer testifying under
oath says that an event occurred, then this event almost certainly/probably/possibly
did occur.” Some generalizations may be based on what is referred to as “common
sense generalizations” while others are based on speciﬁc knowledge of phenomena
that the events describe. The kinds of generalizations, as well as various inferential
hazards they present, are described in Chapters 3, 4, and 10. These basic argument
ingredients make it possible to provide an introductory account of the three basic
credentials of evidence.
2. On relevance
When is a triﬂe evidence? The answer is: when its relevance to some material propo-
sition or matter to be proved in the case at hand is demonstrated. The Federal Rules
of Evidence in the United States provide a useful deﬁnition:
Rule 401. Deﬁnition of “Relevant Evidence.” “Relevant evidence” means evidence having
any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the deter-
mination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the
evidence.
In order to be relevant, evidence must either make a penultimate probandum
more or less probable (or must be relevant to the credibility of a witness or other
evidenceofferedinthecase).Inshort,penultimateprobandasupplythetouchstones
for establishing the relevance of evidence.
There are two important species of relevant evidence – directly relevant evidence
and indirectly relevant evidence.14 These are illustrated in Figure 2.6. Evidence E∗is
14 The meaning of directly relevant and indirectly relevant should not be confused with the legal
meaning of the direct and indirect evidence. The terms direct and indirect evidence have different
meanings in law. In law, “[d]irect evidence is evidence which, if believed, resolves a matter in
issue.” McCormick (1999) 278. All other evidence is indirect or circumstantial because “even if the
circumstances depicted are accepted as true, additional reasoning is required to reach the desired
conclusion.” Id. (See further below pp. 76–77.)

directly relevant because it is linked directly by a chain of reasoning to a penultimate
probandum P1. As a result, E∗is said to be directly relevant evidence if the chain of
reasoning is defensible.
The other four items of evidence A∗
1, A∗
2, A∗
3, and A∗
4 are also relevant, but
only indirectly so. Although they are themselves not directly linked to a penulti-
mate probandum, they are nevertheless relevant because they each bear upon the
strength or weakness of links in the chain of reasoning set up by an item of directly
relevant evidence. As a result, these four items are indirectly relevant or ancillary
evidence.
For example, a witness Willard testiﬁes that defendant Donald was at the scene
of the crime when it happened. His evidence is admitted since it bears upon Don-
ald’s opportunity to have committed the crime; i.e. it is directly relevant evidence.
Then a rebuttal witness Ruth testiﬁes that she was with Willard at a location several
miles away from the scene of the crime at the time the crime was committed. If
what Ruth says is true, then Willard’s assertion cannot be true. Ruth’s testimony
about Willard’s location is relevant because it makes it less probable that Donald
had an opportunity to commit the crime. However, Ruth’s testimony, when con-
sidered in light of Willard’s testimony, is also relevant because it diminishes or
negates the credibility of Willard’s testimony about Donald. In other words, Ruth’s
testimony is indirectly relevant and is ancillary evidence bearing upon Willard’s
credibility.
3. The credibility of evidence and its sources
An item of evidence can be either a tangible item or a testimonial assertion. A major
question is: To what extent can we believe what this evidence says? In other words,
and in symbols, if E∗represents the evidence we have that event E occurred, the
credibility question is: To what extent does E∗justify a belief or inference that event
