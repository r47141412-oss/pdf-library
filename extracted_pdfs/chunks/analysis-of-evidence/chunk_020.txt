The principles of proof and the
law of evidence
A. Introduction
The purpose of this book is to provide a theoretical and practical foundation for
mastering some speciﬁc analytical skills relating to the construction and criticism
of arguments about disputed questions of fact. It is not a book about the law of
evidence, but a central theme has been that the principles of proof and the law
of evidence are intimately related. Like Wigmore, we believe that understanding
the principles of proof is a valuable, perhaps a necessary, foundation both for
understanding the rules and learning how to use them in practice.
At several points this interdependence has been made explicit. Chapters 1 and
2 illustrate the extent to which the two subjects share the same basic concepts:
for example, relevance, materiality, weight/probative force, admissibility, inference,
credibility, corroboration, prejudicial effect, and so on. In Chapter 3, we saw how
nearly all secondary writers on evidence, including all the leading treatise writers,
have worked within a framework of shared assumptions, which we called “The
Rationalist Tradition.” Those assumptions are common to the principles of proof
and the basic principles of the law of evidence in common law countries. We also
saw how relevance and weight are governed by “logic and general experience” rather
than formal rules and that relevance is the main test of admissibility of evidence.
As questions of admissibility are increasingly determined by exercise of judicial
discretion and application of balancing tests in the circumstances of a particular
case (for example the weighing of prejudicial effect against probative value), so
too the logic of proof and the practical operation of rulings on admissibility have
increasingly converged. In Chapter 8, we looked further at the idea that there are no
rules of weight, and we considered different standards of proof, review, and appeal
in the context of weighing evidence. In Chapter 10, we considered brieﬂy scientiﬁc
generalizations and judicial notice. All of these topics are central to understanding
the law of evidence.
In this chapter we will seek to synthesize these ideas by presenting a coherent
overview of the law of evidence as developed by Wigmore’s teacher, James Bradley
Thayer, and use this as a framework for integrating the principles of proof and
the technical rules of evidence. We then present an overview of the approach to

Analysis of Evidence
analyzing for admissibility under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The chapter ends
by proposing a general protocol for analyzing any problem of admissibility.
B. What is the law of evidence? A Thayerite overview1
In the Anglo-American tradition there have been four principal attempts to develop
an explicit general theory of the law of evidence. Gilbert tried to subsume all the
rules of evidence under a single principle, the “best evidence rule”;2 Bentham saw
the existing technical rules as an illogical and indefensible morass, and he argued
that there should be no binding rules at all within the framework of the Natural
System of Procedure; Stephen tried to ﬁnd a coherent rationale for the whole of the
law of evidence in the principle of relevancy. Thayer admired Stephen’s enterprise
but agreed with Sir Frederick Pollock’s judgment that it represented “a splendid
mistake.”3 Relevance was a matter of logic, not law and “The law has no mandamus
on the logical faculty.”4 Thayer treated the rules of evidence as a mixed group of
exceptions to a principle of freedom of proof.
Nearly all modern writers on evidence in the common law world have accepted
some version of Thayer’s thesis, and it has more or less explicitly provided the basis
for most subsequent attempts to codify this branch of the law, including the Federal
RulesofEvidence.5 Accordingly,Thayeristhenaturalstarting-pointforinterpreting
the current position.
The Thayerite conception of the law of evidence has a strikingly narrow focus.
It concerns processes in court; it is restricted to what facts may be presented to the
court by whom and the manner of their presentation. It is not directly concerned
with pre-trial and post-trial events. Over time, many topics previously included in
books on evidence were exiled to procedure, pleading, or substantive law and, in
the United States, to constitutional law. Underlying this conception are sharp dis-
tinctions between materiality, relevance, admissibility, and cogency, each of which
is governed by a different set of criteria. In constructing an argument on an issue of
fact, a four-stage intellectual procedure has to be followed, with each stage belong-
ing to a different sphere of discourse and allocated to a speciﬁc functionary. Thus
in a contested jury trial the standard pattern is as follows:
1 What are the facts to be proved? (Facts in issue, ultimate probanda, material facts are
all synonymous in this context.) This is the issue of materiality. It is governed by
substantive law and is to be determined by the judge.
2 Of any fact offered as evidence or potential evidence: Does this fact tend to support or
tend to negate one or more of the facts in issue? This is the question of relevance; it is
governed by logic and general experience, and is a matter for the judge.

3 Of any fact offered as evidence or potential evidence: Is there a rule or principle that
requires that this item of relevant evidence should be excluded or its use limited
because either
(a) it belongs to a class of inadmissible evidence; or
(b) it would be contrary to the policy of the law to admit this in the circumstances of
the case?
This issue of admissibility is governed by the law of evidence, and is a question for the
judge.
4 What weight should be given to this item of evidence (or the evidence as a whole) in
the circumstances of the case? This is the issue of evaluation of weight (or cogency or
probative force); it is governed by “logic and general experience,” and is a matter for
the jury or other trier of fact. An alternative interpretation is that the criteria for
weight of evidence are provided by probability theory, of which there are many
versions (see above, Chapter 9).
Thayer’ssurgicalnarrowingdownofthescopeofthelawofevidencewasinspired
ground-clearing.Hethenmoldedwhatremainedintoasimpleandcoherentsystem,
based on two principles:
(1) That nothing is to be received which is not logically probative of some matter
requiring to be proved; and
(2) that everything which is thus probative should come in, unless a clear ground of
policy of law excludes it.6
The ﬁrst principle (the test of relevance) is exclusionary, but it is not strictly speaking
part of the law of evidence: “It is not so much a rule of evidence as a presupposition
involved in the very conception of a rational system of evidence.”7 The second prin-
ciple is inclusionary and is the basic principle of the law of evidence. It mandates
the reception of evidence supposed to be logically relevant to the facts in issue,
subject to exceptions prescribed by law. The main role of technical rules of evidence
is to prescribe the scope of the exceptions to the general inclusionary principle.
Thayer’s explanation for the perceived complexity of the subject was essentially his-
torical. While the exclusionary rules were logically exceptions to a general principle
of inclusion, the historical process was different:
What has taken place, in fact, is the shutting out of the judges of one and another thing
from time to time; and so, gradually, the recognition of this exclusion under a rule.
These rules of exclusion have had their exceptions; and so the law has come into the
shape of a set of primary rules of exclusion; and then a set of exceptions to these rules.8
These exceptions, and exceptions to exceptions, were justiﬁed on disparate grounds:
Some things are rejectedasbeingoftooslightasigniﬁcance, or as having too conjectural
and remote a connection; others, as being dangerous in their effect on the jury, and
likely to be misused or overestimated by that body; others as being impolitic, or unsafe

Analysis of Evidence
on public grounds; others on the bare ground of precedent. It is this sort of thing, as I
said before – the rejection on one or other practical ground, of what is really probative –
which is the characteristic thing in the law of evidence; stamping it as a child of the jury
system.9
ThreepointsaboutThayer’sconceptionofthescopeofthelawofevidencedeserve
emphasis. First, the core of Thayer’s view of the law of evidence is concerned with
the regulation of reasoning about disputed questions of fact at trial.10 The law
of evidence consists mainly of artiﬁcial limitations on free enquiry and ordinary
reason in the process of arguing about and justifying decisions on such questions.
Since the law, by and large, leaves judgments about relevancy and weight to logic
and general experience, the “excluding function” is the main role of the law of
evidence.
Secondly, the converse of this last proposition is not the case. The law of evidence
is only one of several grounds for excluding evidence. In litigation the issues are
artiﬁcially and sharply deﬁned in advance by substantive law and pleading; histo-
rians, physical scientists, and others have no strong concept of materiality to limit
their enquiries in such ways. More evidence is excluded on grounds of irrelevance
than for any other reason; but relevance is a matter of logic, not law, even if lawyers
tend to interpret relevance more strictly than most. It should also be remembered
that Bentham, who wished to abolish all formal rules of evidence, was in favor of
exclusion of evidence if it was irrelevant or superﬂuous or its adduction would have
involved preponderant vexation, expense or delay judged by the standard of utility
in the circumstances of the case.
Thirdly, Thayer indicates that questions of weight are not and should not be
governed by rules of law, but they are subject only to “the ordinary rules of human
thought and experience, to be sought in the ordinary sources, and not in the
law books.”11 In short, the law prescribes almost no rules for the evaluation of
evidence.12
By and large, subsequent treatise writers and codiﬁers have followed Thayer in
accepting a fairly restrictive view of the law of evidence, but have followed Wigmore
in including all or most of the “borderline” topics, such as presentation of evidence,
burdens and presumptions, and appellate review.13

which presents a summary overview of the canons of Australian law of evidence in the spirit of
Thayer under nine basic heads. This is helpful in concretizing Thayer’s theory, but is not included
here as it does not represent modern US law in respect of a few speciﬁc details.

seem natural to start by elucidating the nature and scope of that principle, before
considering the exceptions. What, then, is “free proof”? In the present context, one
can give a relatively straightforward answer that ﬁts the Thayerite view of the law
of evidence. “Free proof” means an absence of formal rules that interfere with free
enquiry and natural or common sense reasoning. In the adversary system, where
the parties have primary control over what evidence is presented in what form and
what questions are or are not put to witnesses, the freedom of enquiry by judge,
jury, or other triers of fact is strictly limited. It is for the parties to determine whom
and what they see or hear, but not how they evaluate and reason from evidence.
This “freedom” is largely the freedom of the parties and to a lesser extent that of the
judge, jury, or trier of fact.14 This conception of “free proof” is entirely compatible
with the Thayerite picture of the law of evidence.
We saw in Chapter 3 that Thayer’s disciple, Wigmore, treated the principle of
proof and the law of evidence as two complementary parts of a single subject, what
he called judicial evidence. The principles of proof, said Wigmore, were anterior to
and more important than what he called the “Trial Rules.” It is worth revisiting both
elements in this claim. Wigmore argued that it was better to study the principles
of proof before studying the rules. This was not merely because it seems sensible
to study a basic principle before considering exceptions to it. More important, the
principles of proof are logically anterior to the law of evidence, as well as providing
many of their underlying rationales (insofar as they had a rational basis). Thayer
had made essentially the same point when he claimed that these two basic principles
of evidence (the exclusionary and inclusionary principles) were not so much part of
the law of evidence as necessary presuppositions of a rational system of evidence.15
The exclusion of irrelevant evidence was a matter of logic not law; and there was
a general presumption in favor of admitting all relevant evidence. In order to have
a clear view of the law of evidence, one needs ﬁrst to understand these two basic
principles of proof.
In our experience, Thayer and Wigmore have both been proved right, but like
many other teachers of evidence, we have extended the focus of attention beyond the
courtroom and the contested trial to cover allphases of litigation, from investigation
to post-trial decisions. This is not only because the law of evidence “casts a long
shadow,” but also because inferential reasoning is an important part of many pre-
and post-trial decisions. It is for this reason that we have adopted a “total process”
14 Thisis,ofcourse,ratherdifferentfromBentham’smodeloftheNaturalSystemofProcedure,which
was more inquisitorial in nature. Nevertheless, Bentham’s attack on all binding rules of evidence,
his “anti-nomian thesis,” provides the classic picture of a system of free proof in adjudication:
no rules excluding classes of witnesses or of evidence; no rules of priority or weight or quantum;
no binding rules as to form or manner of presentation; no artiﬁcial restriction on questioning or
reasoning; no right of silence or testimonial privileges; no restrictions on reasoning other than the
general principles of practical reason; no exclusion of evidence unless it is irrelevant or superﬂuous
or its adduction would involve preponderant vexation, expense, or delay in the circumstances of
the particular case. For a detailed discussion see Twining (1985) Ch. 2.

Analysis of Evidence
model of litigation (both civil and criminal) and have emphasized the importance
of differentiating the standpoints of different participants at different stages of legal
processes as well as of different kinds of outside observers.
C. One law of evidence?
Our approach in this book combines the ideal type of the Rationalist Tradition,
a total process model of litigation, principles of proof, methods of marshaling
arguments, and a substance-blind approach to the credentials of evidence, espe-
cially relevance, credibility, and probative force. It also deals with the relationship
between generalizations, narrative, and argument. All of these transcend differences
between evidentiary problems in civil, criminal, and other contexts. They represent
the general part of the study of evidence in law within the tradition of Thayer and
Wigmore. However, detailed study of the technical rules of evidence needs to be
sensitive to the differences between procedural and institutional contexts and to
the different rationales and policies underlying criminal and civil proceedings and
other kinds of litigation. Indeed, in most civil law systems the rules of evidence are
treated as part of procedure, and civil, criminal, and administrative procedural sys-
tems belong to different specialisms. In England, especially since the decline of the
civil jury, most courses on evidence focus almost exclusively on evidence in crim-
inal proceedings. One of the leading textbooks is now called Criminal Evidence.16
This trend has probably gone further in England than in most common law
countries.
IntheUnitedStates, the situation is more complexfortherehavebeenconﬂicting
trends. Evidence is still treated as a single subject in most books and courses, partly
because the jury is still important in civil cases and because the Federal Rules cover
both civil and criminal evidence. However, in dealing with questions of admissi-
bility and proof, constant attention must still be paid to the different underlying
principles, policies, and rationales of civil and criminal litigation. Furthermore,
the impact of constitutional law on criminal procedure has promoted the separa-
tion of civil and criminal evidence. However, some important constitutional issues
are treated more in courses on criminal procedure or constitutional law than in
courses on evidence, whereas in England the impact of the European Convention on
Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998 can hardly be ignored in a course on
evidence.
16 Roberts and Zuckerman (2004). Evidentiary issues arise in all types of proceeding, in all types
of legal processes and at every stage. However, Roberts argues that the subject becomes more
manageable and coherent if one focuses on one type of proceeding – viz. criminal process (Roberts
(2002)). We agree that it is desirable to integrate the law of civil and criminal evidence with their
differentproceduralcontexts,butwouldreiteratethatthelogicofproofishighlytransferableacross

stages of criminal process, intelligence scenarios, and other non-legal examples to emphasize this
transferability.

D. Linking the principles of proof and the law of evidence:
relevance as the main bridge
As we have seen, the logic of proof is an important element in studying, for exam-
ple, judicial notice, similar facts, prejudicial effect/probative value, burdens and
standards of proof (and for other decisions),17 and presumptions. The increasingly
important subject of scientiﬁc and expert evidence is a good peg on which to hang
some of the central epistemological questions concerning evidence.18 However,
the main bridge between fact analysis/the principles of proof and legal doctrine is
supplied by the topic of relevance because:
a Relevance is the most important mechanism of exclusion.
b The principles of proof are anterior to the other exclusionary rules because they deal
with the exclusion of relevant evidence. In other words, the question of relevance
needs to be determined as a preliminary to considering whether a particular
exclusionary rule applies to a particular item of potential evidence.
c To understand relevance involves understanding the principles and characteristics of
inferential reasoning.
d The law of evidence can be treated as a coherent whole by Thayer’s inclusionary and
exclusionary principles, which are expressed in terms of relevance within a basic
framework of argumentation.
Many modern course books treat relevance as the ﬁrst topic to be studied on the
lawofevidence.Theyoftendevotesubstantialspacetoit.Whilestayingwiththeidea
that relevance is the core of both the logic of proof and the rules of evidence, we have
tried in this book to present a broader and more coherent foundation to the study of
the rules. It is important that this should be more than just a preliminary topic to be
studied at the beginning of a course and then forgotten; rather the approach needs
to be an integral part of the detailed study of most standard topics in an evidence
course.19
E. Analyzing for admissibility20
The connection between the principles of proof and exclusionary rules is clear if we
think in terms of argumentation. If an item of evidence is inadmissible, this means
that it may not be part of an argument and so it has no place on the chart. The
17 On the broader concept of “standards for decision” see above, Ch. 8.
18 Roberts 324–28. The links between epistemology and scientiﬁc evidence have been brilliantly
explored by the philosopher Susan Haack. See especially Haack (2003) Ch. 9 and Haack (2004).
19 A similar point is made by Paul Roberts. In arguing for more attention to be paid to relevance, he
suggests that after a preliminary consideration at the start of a course, the lessons can be reinforced
by explicit consideration of it in relation to other topics such as previous misconduct evidence,
hearsay, and silence. (Roberts (2002) 306–7). See further Roberts and Zuckerman (2004), passim.
For an illustration see pages 341–43 below.
20 This heading echoes the title of the excellent Ch. 8 of Palmer (2004), which deals with this subject
in more detail but at a general level.

Analysis of Evidence
exclusionary rules tell us what may or may not be part of an argument. Since these
formal rules work to exclude relevant evidence, relevance is always a preliminary
issue. But relevance can only be determined in relation to a material fact or another
fact of consequence. In other words the ultimate and penultimate probanda need to
be established before either questions of exclusion because of irrelevance or other
grounds of inadmissibility can be determined.
Thus where an issue of admissibility arises, questions of relevance arise twice:
relevance to a fact of consequence and relevance to credibility. Often the initial
question of relevance may be unproblematic. For example, in a murder case a
confession, “I killed Charlie,” is obviously directly relevant to opportunity and
identity, though it may not tell us anything about criminal intent or a possible
defense. But the prosecution must ﬁrst lay a foundation, by introducing evidence
that the confession was voluntary.
Sometimes the argument can become quite complicated and it may be helpful to
use a Wigmorean approach to clarify an issue of admissibility. For instance, in the
case of R. v. George Joseph Smith (the brides in the bath murders) the prosecution
had plenty of evidence of motive and opportunity, but there was not much evidence
to support the propositions that Smith caused the death of Bessy Munday and that
he did so with criminal intent. The prosecution successfully argued that evidence of
the deaths of two other brides by drowning in similar circumstances was admissible.
ThepassagefromtheperorationintheclosingspeechbyThomasBodkinQCforthe
Crown is powerful as rhetoric, but it masks a quite complex argument.21 One can
reconstruct the argument in Wigmorean terms as follows: Standpoint: counsel for
the prosecution arguing that details of the deaths of two other brides are admissible.
Ultimate probandum: GJS murdered Bessie Munday.
1 GJS caused BM to die by drowning22
2 GJS acted with criminal intent
3 There was a large aggregation of resemblances between the deaths of BM and two
other recent brides
4 The aggregation of resemblances could not have occurred without design.
5 The combination of factors a–l is too uncommon to be a coincidence. (G)23
6 In all three cases factors a–l were present
21 See above, Ch. 1, C3a.
22 This could be disaggregated into two propositions relating to cause and identity: A person caused
BM’s death by drowning; it was GJS who caused BM’s death. Identity was not really in question
in the case.
23 The factors emphasized by Bodkin were (a) going through a form of marriage; (b) the ready money
of the woman was withdrawn or realized; (c) a will was drawn in favor of GJS absolutely; (d) the
will was drawn by a stranger to the testatrix; (e) the victim either insured her life or had property
that made this unnecessary; (f) there was a visit to a doctor, which was unnecessary given the
physical condition of the patient; (g) the woman wrote letters to relatives on the night before she
died or on the same night; (h) the prisoner was the ﬁrst to discover the drowning; (i) the door was
unfastened and the water was not drawn off until after the doctor had been; (j) the prisoner put
forward demonstrably that he had been shopping and absent from the house in which his wife was
lying dead; (k) the prisoner disappeared after the event; (l) the prisoner achieved or attempted to
achieve monetary advantage as a result of the death.

Several points are worth noting about this example. First, the argument about
design supports three material facts (causation, identity, and criminal intent). Sec-
ond, a crucial step in the argument involves a generalization about coincidence. In
this case, it seems very plausible, but arguments from coincidence are frequency
arguments that can easily be abused.24 Third, this case should be distinguished from
similar fact arguments that involve “propensity” as a step in the reasoning. Such
cases, which have caused a great deal of difﬁculty in all common law countries,
can also be usefully analyzed by the chart method.25 Here the argument was about
coincidence to support design and did not involve any reference to the character of
the accused. Today, such cases all need to be analyzed in terms of prejudicial effect
versus probative value.26 Fourth, part of the strength of the argument in this case
arises from a synergy between individual pieces of evidence: several of the common
factors support the proposition that Smith had so arranged things that he stood to
gain ﬁnancially, i.e. he had a motive, which further supports design, identity, and
intent.
At a general level one can analyze most issues of admissibility by asking four
questions, as follows:
1 Does this evidence raise a potential issue of admissibility? (e.g., evidence of
circumstances of two other murders.)
2 If so, what is the purpose for which it is being tendered? (To what fact(s) in issue is
this evidence relevant? In Smith both cause of death and criminal intent.)
3 What are the facts relevant to the question of admissibility of this evidence?
(Sometimes referred to as “foundational facts”; e.g., the facts that in each case factors
a–l were present.)
4 What evidence tends to prove the existence of the foundational facts? (e.g., the
evidence that factors a–l were present in Case I and Case II.)27
24 E.g., R. v. Clark [2003] E.W.C.A. Crim. 1020 (Sally Clark, multiple cot deaths, discussed in
Appendix I on the website).
25 See Acorn (1991).
26 See, however, the Criminal Justice Act 2003, sections 101 and 103: bad character is admissible
where “it is relevant to an important matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution,”
subject to a general condition of “fairness.” For a good discussion see Roberts and Zuckerman
(2004), suggesting that for most purposes this legislative intervention “reads like a convoluted
restatement of existing legal principles” (517).

F. Analysis under the United States Federal Rules of Evidence
The Federal Rules of Evidence, enacted as law in the United States (the “Federal
Rules”), provide a good vehicle to illustrate the relationship between analysis of
evidence and rules of evidence because all of the basic rules are prescribed in statu-
tory form in a uniﬁed code.28 Unlike most common law jurisdictions, the rules do
not have to be taken from separate codes regulating civil and criminal procedure or
distilled from piecemeal legislation or appellate decisions or treatises by recognized
authorities.29 Having authoritative statements of the rules collected and organized
as a coherent code simpliﬁes the task.
The rules of evidence fall into three overlapping categories. In the ﬁrst are rules
adapting the principles of proof to the judicial context. In the second are rules
designedtoregulatetheprobativeprocessbyidentifyingimproperprejudicialeffects
that may result from the admission and use of particular kinds of evidence and
requiring that the trial court weigh those effects against the legitimate probative
value of the evidence in the case before it. In the third category are rules that require
the exclusion of evidence without regard to its probative value based upon policies
that override the importance of establishing truth. Some rules do not ﬁt neatly into
just one category; an analysis of their application requires consideration of factors
from two or sometimes all three categories. Nonetheless, the categories provide a
useful starting-point for considering the relationship between analysis of evidence
and the application of the rules of evidence prescribed by law.

in judicial trials

if it has any tendency to make a fact of consequence more probable or less probable
than it would be in the absence of that evidence. There are only two kinds of facts
of consequence in any case – the facts that are deﬁned as material by the applicable
rules of substantive law, and the credibility of evidence once it has been admitted.
Whether an item of evidential data is relevant can only be demonstrated by applying
the principles of logic developed above in Chapter 3. Under Rule 402, all relevant
evidence is admissible, unless it is excluded or its use is limited by the Constitution
of the United States, by statute, or by another of the Federal Rules.
Trials in the United States and other common law systems, especially jury trials,
are designed to be single, continuous events whose beginning point (opening
statements) and end points (closing statements, jury instruction, deliberation, and
verdict or decision) are deﬁned in advance. They are not open-ended inquiries of
the kind undertaken in science and other disciplines. They are closed inquiries in

Analysis of Evidence
which decision-makers may not have any training or expertise in analyzing evidence
to resolve disputed questions of fact. For that reason, additional rules are necessary
to regulate the admission and use of evidence in that context.
A moderate modern Benthamite or a trained investigator in another discipline
would accept some of these rules as sensible adaptations. They would probably
accept as reasonable the requirement that a witness have personal knowledge of
the matter about which she testiﬁes (Rule 602), that she testify under oath subject
to the penalties for perjury (Rule 603), that a witness expressing an opinion must
demonstrate that she is qualiﬁed by training or experience to express the opinion
and, in the case of experts, that the opinion be based upon reliable principles reliably
applied to reach the proffered conclusion (Rules 701–705).30
Most scientists and historians would also recognize the principle that their inves-
tigations must be limited to some degree by efﬁciency concerns. Resources are ﬁnite,
and a conclusion, however provisional, must be reached at some point. The need for
efﬁciency is greater in the jury trial context and, for that reason, they would prob-
ably recognize that rules adopted to promote efﬁciency must be more stringent
than might be appropriate in other contexts. Rule 102 articulates efﬁciency as one
of potentially conﬂicting goals that should be considered in applying the rules of
evidence. Efﬁciency is one of the grounds used to justify the limits on the kinds of
evidence that may be used to prove relevant character traits imposed by Rules 405
(methods of proving character), 608 (character and conduct of witness), and the
rule authorizing a court to take judicial notice (Rule 201).
The application of these rules usually requires considerable analysis of the par-
ticular evidence to determine whether any of the efﬁciency based rules should be
applied to admit or to exclude or limit the use of that evidence.
Questions
1 Which of the other Federal Rules can be justiﬁed, at least in part, based upon having
as one of their objectives the promotion of efﬁciency?
2 Which of these rules would a scientist or historian recognize as a sensible limitation
on the evidence that may be received in a trial?
3 Rule 403 is based in part on efﬁciency concerns: “Although relevant, evidence may be
excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed . . . by considerations of
undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” What
limits on the judge’s discretion to exclude relevant evidence based upon these
considerations would a scientist or historian suggest that appellate courts adopt and
impose?
30 Three decisions, Daubert v. Merrel Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 578 (1993); General Electric
Co. v. Joiner, 552 U.S. 166 (1997); and Kumho Tire Company, Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137
(1998), have made questions about the admissibility of scientiﬁc or expert evidence a major area
of litigation and scholarship in the United States.

4 Scientists and historians often decline to seek some kinds of evidence based upon the
considerations expressed in the quoted portion of Rule 403. What limits should be
imposed upon the scientist’s or the historian’s exercise of discretion not to seek
additional evidence based upon these grounds, and how should those limits be
enforced?
5 Who has the broadest discretion to exclude evidence based upon the quoted
consideration, with impunity: the trial judge, the scientist, or the historian?
2. Analysis and the rules designed to regulate the probative processes
The prejudicial effects that the Federal Rules were designed to regulate can be
analyzed using a spectrum that has two ends. At one end are limitations based
upon efﬁciency concerns such as those described above. At the other end are kinds
of evidence that can be characterized as having improper prejudicial effects only
becausetheadmission and use of such evidence wouldconﬂictwithpoliciesdeemed
more important than the probative value such evidence might have in establishing
truth. The fact that a city repaired a crack in the sidewalk after a citizen had broken
her leg when it caused her to stumble would be relevant as evidence having a ten-
dency to show the city recognized that the condition was dangerous and that it was a
conditionthatcouldhavebeeneasilyﬁxed.Ifthecitythoughtthatrepairingthecrack
might increase the likelihood that it would be held liable for the citizen’s injuries, it
might leave it unrepaired until the issue had been resolved. We want the city to ﬁx
the dangerous condition as soon as possible. Rule 407 excluding evidence of subse-
quent remedial measures offered to prove negligence, culpable conduct, a defect in
a product or its design, or the need for a warning or construction was adopted to
implement this policy. Rules 408 (excluding evidence of settlement discussions to
prove liability or the amount of damages), 409 (limiting the use of evidence of pay-
ment of medical or similar expenses), 410 (limiting the use of evidence of pleas and
plea discussions), and 411 (limiting the use of evidence of liability insurance) were
all enacted to further similar policy objectives, notwithstanding the probative value
such evidence might have with respect to facts of consequence that are disputed in
a particular case.
Itisimportanttonotethatnoneoftheserulesexcludestheevidenceinallcircum-
stances. For example, a trial judge has discretion to admit evidence of subsequent
remedial measures if the evidence is offered for other purposes such as proving
ownership or control. For that reason, arguments about the admissibility or use of
evidence covered by these rules require that counsel seeking to have such evidence
admitted must be able to analyze and articulate the inferences that demonstrate that
the evidence has probative value for purposes other than the purpose prohibited
by the rule. Similarly, opposing counsel must be able to identify the impermissible
prejudicial effects the rule was enacted to avoid and to construct and articulate
arguments that will persuade the trial judge that the identiﬁed improper prejudi-
cial effects outweigh the legitimate probative value of the evidence. This requires

careful analysis of the particular evidence and of the different inferences it might
support.

law the effects that are improperly prejudicial. But when the question is whether the
improper prejudicial effect outweighs the legitimate probative value of the proffered
evidence, skill in microanalysis and the use of the logical principles provide the tools
necessary to construct persuasive arguments bearing upon that issue.
Exercise
Rule 407 speciﬁes that the evidence of a subsequent remedial measure is not admis-
sible to prove negligence or culpability (an improper prejudicial effect), but it is
admissible to prove ownership or control (a legitimate probative value). Assume
Mr. Smith was injured when his car crashed as a result of a large hole in a graveled
road that connected Farmer Jones’s house to the highway. The next day, Farmer
Jones ﬁlled the hole and put new gravel on the road. Smith sued Jones, and Jones
alleged the road was owned by her neighbor, and thus the neighbor was responsible
for its maintenance and repair. At trial, Smith calls a witness who will testify that she
saw Jones ﬁll the hole and regravel the road on the day after Smith’s accident. Jones
argues that the evidence is inadmissible to prove that he was negligent or culpable.
Smith argues it should be admitted to prove Jones’s ownership and control of the
road.
1 What test should the court apply in deciding whether the improper prejudicial effects
the evidence will have as evidence of Farmer Jones’s negligence and culpability require
that it be excluded notwithstanding its legitimate probative value as evidence that
Jones owned and controlled the road and was responsible for repair? Should the court
require that Jones satisfy it that the improper prejudicial effect outweighs the
legitimate probative value? Substantially outweighs? Is at least equal to the probative
value? Given the congressional policy that led to the enactment of the rule, should the
court require that Smith satisfy it that the probative value outweighs the improper
prejudicial effects? Substantially outweighs? Is at least equal to or greater than the
prejudicial effects?
2 In addressing this issue, is the court deciding a question of law or a question of fact? Is
it applying the rule or using the rule as a guide to the exercise of discretion? If the
court admits the evidence, can that decision be reversed on appeal? What if it excludes
the evidence?
3 As counsel for either of the parties, what other evidence would you ask the trial judge
to consider in deciding whether to admit the witness’s testimony? What additional
evidence might strengthen the argument that the evidence should be excluded? What
additional evidence might strengthen the argument that the evidence should be
admitted? If counsel for one of the parties had looked for, but been unable to ﬁnd,
additional evidence that might affect the balance and had reported her efforts to the

court, should the court consider the unavailability of the evidence? If opposing
counsel admitted he had not even looked for additional evidence relevant to the issue,
what, if any, weight should the court give to this failure?
Rule 403 articulates the general test under which relevant evidence may be
excluded. Evidence may be excluded if the improper prejudicial effects of that evi-
dence substantially outweigh its legitimate probative value. Most of the remaining
rules authorizing the exclusion of relevant evidence, or the imposition of limi-
tations on evidence for the purpose for which such evidence may be used, can
be explained as recurring situations in which judicial experience has shown the
inherent improper prejudicial effects of speciﬁc kinds of evidence by a margin
sufﬁcient to justify the exclusion of that kind of evidence or the imposition of lim-
itations on its use. The problems presented by United States v. Able illustrate these
points.
Rule 404(b) reﬂects a social judgment that evidence that an accused has commit-
ted a crime other than the crime charged will create a substantial risk that the jury
will convict the accused based upon a judgment that she is a bad person deserving
of punishment, notwithstanding any weaknesses in the other evidence offered to
establish guilt of the charged crime. “We try the act, not the actor.” Rule 404(b)
also recognizes, however, that evidence of another crime may also have a legiti-
mate probative value with respect to relevant facts, such as motive or identity. In
such circumstances, the judge has discretion to admit evidence of the other crime,
notwithstanding its improper prejudicial effects.
Evidence that Able used cocaine was relevant to motive, which in turn is relevant
to intent to defraud. Cocaine is an expensive drug, and the decline in Able’s income
substantially exceeded the decline in his expenses. On the other hand, there is a
substantial possibility that at least some jurors would vote to convict Abel (a) for
his cocaine use, or (b) in a belief that it was beyond reasonable doubt that he either
used cocaine or he intended to defraud the government by ﬁling a false tax return
and, thus, deserved to be punished, or (c) because a person who violates the law
by using cocaine is a person who has a propensity to violate the law, and for that
reason Able’s illegal cocaine use increases the likelihood that he illegally ﬁled a false
tax return to an extent that justiﬁes overlooking weaknesses in the other evidence
of guilt offered by the government.
Able also illustrates the role that microanalysis plays in constructing arguments
about the admissibility and use of evidence. In the absence of reliable evidence
concerning the quantity and price of the cocaine Able used, the legitimate pro-
bative value of cocaine use with respect to ﬁnancial motive was diminished, but
the improper prejudicial effects remained great. So too, (a) the number of steps
in the inferential chain necessary to demonstrate the relevance of the fact that the
$25,000 check from the law ﬁrm was cashed in Las Vegas in December to the exis-
tence of a motive to falsify Able’s tax return the following April and (b) the plausible

explanations for each of those inferential steps made it possible to construct a strong
argument that the improper propensity effects of the endorsement evidence, stand-
ing alone, and the likelihood the jury would misvalue that evidence, substantially

above.
Questions
1 George Joseph Smith was charged with the murder of Bessie Mundy. The relevance
and legitimate probative value of evidence that two of his other “brides” drowned in
similar circumstances is discussed and charted above. The improper prejudicial effects
are not. Were there any improper prejudicial effects other than the obvious propensity
effects? Assuming Rules 403 and 404(b) had been in effect, construct an argument
demonstrating that the improper prejudicial effects of that evidence outweighed its
legitimate probative value.
2 Smith was not indicted for the other murders. Why not? Consider the following
proposal to amend Rule 404(b) by adding the following as the second sentence of that
rule:
Evidence of another crime shall not be admissible unless the accused has either
(i) pled guilty to or been convicted of that crime or (ii) had been indicted and is
being tried for that crime as part of the case in which such evidence is offered.
Should the proposed amendment be adopted? Why or why not? Justify your
position.
3 When the prosecution seeks to introduce evidence of another crime or bad act, how
much evidence should it have to produce to establish that the other crime or act
occurred and that the accused was responsible for it? Proof beyond reasonable doubt?
Clear and convincing evidence? A preponderance of the evidence? Some evidence? See
United States v. Huddleston, 485 U.S. 681 (1988) for the answer under the Federal
Rules. See Anderson (1999a) for a Wigmorean critique of the answer and the
reasoning used to justify it.
3. Analysis and mandatory exclusionary rules
Evidence obtained in violation of rights guaranteed by the Constitution and evi-
dence discovered as a result of such a violation may not be admitted against the
accused in a criminal trial no matter how strong its probative value may be. This rule
excludes evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment’s prohibition of
unreasonable searches and seizures or of the ﬁfth amendment’s privilege against self
incrimination.31 Often such evidence is not only highly probative of the accused’s
guilt, but also evidence without which the case cannot be prosecuted – e.g., without
the 20 kilograms of cocaine found in the accused’s apartment through a search that
was subsequently declared unreasonable, the government could not prosecute the
31 U.S. Const., amends. IV and V.
