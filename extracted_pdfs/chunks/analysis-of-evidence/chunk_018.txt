called Dempster’s Rule that allows us to combine support assignments assigned to
different items or bodies of evidence. Dempster’s Rule allows us to go from a lack
of belief to some degree of belief in a proposition in light of further evidence (see
further Shafer (1976), Schum (1994) 225–43).
3. Baconian probability and completeness of evidential coverage
Centuries ago, Sir Francis Bacon proposed the idea that we would be wasting our
time trying to prove some general hypothesis or proposition just by accumulating
evidential instances favorable to this hypothesis. Regardless of how many results
favorable to this hypothesis we have accumulated, all it takes is one demonstrably
unfavorableresulttodisprovethishypothesis.WhatBaconarguedwasthatwewould
be far better off performing evidential tests designed to eliminate any hypothesis
we are considering. The hypothesis that best resists our most concerted efforts to
eliminate it, as well as any other hypotheses, is the one in which we should have
increasing conﬁdence. This strategy has become known as induction by elimination.
The best known development of Bacon’s method was by John Stuart Mill (1843).
It will not do of course in eliminative testing to perform the same test over and
over again. This may increase our belief about the reliability of this single test, but
it will not increase our belief regarding the extent to which any hypothesis holds up
in many circumstances. In the testing of drugs for their possible toxicity to human
beings we need to determine whether a drug continues to be non-toxic under such
conditions as various levels and spacing of dosages, the age and sex of the recipients
of the drug, and possible interactions with other drugs a person might be taking.
In short, eliminative testing also needs to be variative in nature. The more different
conditions under which a hypothesis holds up, the more conﬁdence we can have
in it.
John Stuart Mill was not successful in showing how conventional probability is
applicable in eliminative and variative testing. Nor was the philosopher Karl Popper
later on, who also advocated eliminative testing, successful in relating conventional
probability to such testing. Popper did, however, claim that science should strive
for improbable hypotheses that provide us with the most surprising deductions of
new phenomena (Popper, 1968). Development of a system of probability expressly
congenial to eliminative and variative induction awaited the work of L. Jonathan
Cohen. In Cohen’s major work (1977), he advocated a system of probabilities that
we now call Baconian to acknowledge their linkage to Bacon’s original ideas about
eliminative and variative testing. In Cohen’s Baconian probability system, evidence
is relevant only if it serves to eliminate one or more hypotheses or propositions
being considered. Such elimination, however, is usually only tentative since later
evidence may act to explain away the eliminative properties of an earlier item of
evidence on a certain hypothesis.

Analysis of Evidence
Figure 9.4 A Baconian probability scale
scale zero means lack of proof rather than disproof. A Baconian probability of zero
for some hypothesis can be revised upward since we can go from lack of proof to
some proof if justiﬁed by evidence. Notice that we have not put any number to be
associated with the upper end of the Baconian scale. The reason involves several
additional properties of Baconian probabilities.
Cohen’s Baconian probabilities have only ordinal properties. What this means
is that we can compare them to see which is larger but we cannot perform any
algebraicoperationsonthem(thoseinvolvingaddition,subtraction,multiplication,
or division). A Baconian probability for some hypothesis or proposition increases
as this hypothesis passes more eliminative and variative evidential tests. But the tests
may not all be comparable since they involve different matters. Thus, for example,
we cannot say that the Baconian probability of hypothesis H1, which has passed four
tests, is twice as large as the Baconian probability of hypothesis H2, which has only
passed two tests. The reason is that the tests passed by these hypotheses may not be
comparable in terms of their importance or eliminative potential. In short, there is
no natural unit of Baconian probability as assumed in conventional probabilities
or on Shafer’s support scale.
We now come to the most important property of Baconian probability as far as
concerns the probative weight or force of evidence. In the eliminative and variative
testing of hypotheses, it is altogether important to consider how many different
tests have been performed and how completely our testing has involved all relevant
matters that anyone could think of. In testing the toxicity of a drug, for example,
regardless of how many other tests drug X has passed, we will not have conﬁdence
in its being non-toxic if we have failed to check to see whether it remains non-
toxic when taken with other drugs or if we ignore its possible long-run effects. In
a Baconian view of probabilistic reasoning the weight of evidence depends in large
part on how many questions there are that remain unanswered by the evidence we
have. In short, the Baconian weight of evidence is related to how complete has been
the coverage of evidence on matters recognized to be relevant in the inference at
hand. Here is a picture of the Baconian interpretation of the probative weight or
force of evidence; it involves the “inferential limb” on which we ﬁnd ourselves when
we attempt to draw a conclusion from evidence.
Suppose on the basis of a collection of evidence we decide to conclude that
hypothesis H is true. Figure 9.5 illustrates the inferential limb we ﬁnd ourselves on
when we draw this conclusion. The length and strength of this limb depends upon

two things. First, the strong part of our inferential limb depends on how much
credible evidence we have that is favorable to hypothesis H. Second, the weak part
of our inferential limb depends on how many questions regarding the likeliness
of any of our hypotheses remain unanswered by the evidence we have. Baconian
probabilities take both of these matters into account. Answers to some of these
unanswered questions may in fact be favorable to our chosen hypothesis H; but
other answers may not be at all favorable to H. We cannot know which ones and
how many will also be favorable until we ask the questions. The basic reason why
we do not put a speciﬁc number on the right-hand end of the Baconian probability
scale in Figure 9.4 is that we ordinarily do not know how many tests of hypoth-
esis H are possible. We can only list those unanswered questions that we have
recognized.
Cohen’s system of Baconian probability is the only system that takes speciﬁc
account of how completely the evidence we have covers matters recognized to be
relevant in the testing of hypotheses we entertain. Such information is not con-
veyed, for example, by Bayesian posterior probabilities, even if they are very large
and near 1.0. Cohen argues that in judging the probative force of evidence we can-
not ignore how much evidence we have and how completely it covers questions
relevant to matters at issue. It happens that Cohen’s major work (1977) is espe-
cially directed at inferences in the ﬁeld of law. In this work, he has assembled a
large collection of anomalies and paradoxes he says are associated with attempts to
apply conventional probabilities to inferences in law. A discussion of the anomalies
and paradoxes Cohen identiﬁed appears elsewhere (Schum, 1979). His work gen-
erated widespread discussion and much controversy among legal scholars as well
as probabilists. Not all of the troubles he mentioned were viewed as anomalous or
paradoxical. But we should not ignore what he has told us about the importance of
evidential completeness in grading the probative weight of evidence.

Analysis of Evidence
4. Wigmore and the fuzzy weight of evidence
Wigmore was no probabilist, but he did understand that the linkages between
probanda in chains of reasoning are probabilistic in nature. This is why we have
said that a chain of reasoning involves sources of doubt or uncertainty. He described
the strength of these probabilistic linkages in words rather than numbers. This is
something that we all do on many occasions when we wish to convey to others our
beliefs about the likeliness of events when we have no basis for assigning precise
numerical probabilities to these events. But Wigmore also used the term “force” in
describing the strength of these probabilistic linkages. He used different symbols
attached to his arrows linking probanda. One symbol meant “weak probative force”;
another symbol meant “strong probative force”; another meant “provisional pro-
bative force”; and there were others. One criticism frequently directed at Wigmore’s
methods concerns his never providing any method for combining all of these verbal
probabilistic force gradations in reaching a conclusion about the aggregate force of
some mass of evidence.
Wigmore died in 1943, only 22 years before the development of “fuzzy logic”
by Professor LotﬁZadeh. In a celebrated paper in 1965, Zadeh asked us all to rec-
ognize how much imprecision is rampant in our inferences, decisions and other
activities. In probabilistic reasoning, for example, we so often attach words rather
than numbers to indicate the strength of our conclusions, since we have no basis
for providing precise single probabilities or even intervals of probabilities. Such
probabilities Zadeh has called “fuzzy probabilities” recognizing their imprecision.
Wigmore’s methods for grading probative force are examples of fuzzy probabili-
ties or hedges. What is especially interesting about Zadeh’s work is that he pro-
vides methods for combining fuzzy gradations of various things. Following is just
one example of Zadeh’s concerns about the fuzziness rampant in our everyday
reasoning.
Suppose you hear the following argument: “If a person is overworked and under-
paid, then this person is probably not very satisﬁed with his/her job.” We hear argu-
ments like this all the time; Zadeh calls such reasoning “inexact” or “approximate.”
All the words italicized in the sentence above are fuzzy ingredients; there is no pre-
cision here regarding any of these ingredients. Fuzzy probabilistic qualiﬁers abound
in the ﬁeld of law, for example: beyond reasonable doubt, balance of probabilities,
clear and convincing evidence, and probable cause. All these forensic standards of
decision are necessarily fuzzy since we are unable to provide precise and uncon-
troversial numerical probabilities, of any kind, to associate with them. In many
situations we may not be able to improve upon Wigmore’s fuzzy gradations of the
probative force of evidence. All of the views we have examined have been criticized
in various ways. Zadeh’s work on fuzzy logic has not escaped criticism. Susan Haack
(1996) questions the philosophical bona ﬁdes of fuzzy logic and also points out that
applications of fuzzy logic designed to cope with imprecision involve mechanisms
that do induce precision.

Probabilities, weight, and probative force
261
In summary, we have provided four quite different interpretations of what is
meant by the probative force, weight or strength of evidence. Each view tells us
something valuable about this important credential of evidence, but no single view
says all there is to be said. Likelihood ratios from Bayes’s Rule allow us to capture
many interesting and important evidential and inferential subtleties and are con-
sistent with what FRE-401 says regarding relevance. Shafer’s direct assessments of
evidential weight as evidential support allow us to be indecisive in hedging conclu-
sionsandtowithholdportionsofourbeliefs,andtheyallowustocaptureimportant
judgmental characteristics that are very common. Baconian interpretations of the
probative force of evidence alert us to the importance of considering how much
evidence we have and how completely it covers matters we recognize as relevant
in inferences we make. Questions we have not yet answered are just as important
in inferences as those for which we have obtained evidential answers. Finally, Wig-
more’s fuzzy gradations of the force of evidence are certainly in keeping with the
many other fuzzy interpretations of uncertainties encountered in the ﬁeld of law.

Necessary but dangerous: generalizations
and stories in argumentation about facts1
Since, then, our inferences from fact to fact depend upon our belief in general rules
of connection between fact and fact, generalizations about the way things happen in
nature, the work of criticizing inferences resolves itself into that of criticizing general-
izations. (Sidgwick (1884) 9)
We have seen that generalizations are almost always necessary as warrants for
every step in inferential reasoning, but that they can often be shown to be the
weakest points in an argument (Chapter 3). Similarly, we have seen that stories are
not just an alternative to analytical approaches such as the chart method, but rather
complement them in important ways (Chapter 6). According to some psychologists
and practitioners stories are psychologically necessary to decision-making about
issues of fact. Yet another strand in the literature suggests that stories are wonderful
vehicles for “cheating” in the process of persuasion in legal contexts. In this chapter
we look in more detail at the nature of generalizations and stories, their role in
fact-determination, some reasons why they can be labeled dangerous, some links
between these dangers, and practical techniques for navigating them in litigation.
A. Generalizations
1. Reprise and introduction
Generalizations are warrants that serve as the “glue” that links an item of evidence
to a particular interim or ultimate probandum by showing that it is relevant (Foun-
dations 81–83, 109). We have previously examined the role of generalizations in
arguments about evidence. In Chapter 3 we identiﬁed the role that generalizations
perform in the application of the principles of logic in constructing and analyzing
arguments. The materials from R. v. Bywaters and Thompson illustrated the kinds
of covert roles that generalizations based upon prejudice may play, roles that make
them dangerous. Chapters 8 and 9 presented current views on how evidence may
be evaluated in various contexts. All of those views depend upon the evaluator’s
1 This chapter is based in large part on two articles (Twining, 1999, and Anderson, 1999). Some of
the themes are further developed in Bazaar, Chs. 12–16.

assessment of the strength (the degree of certainty) with which the generalizations
upon which the arguments being evaluated depend can be expressed.
In this chapter we integrate these materials and present a more comprehensive
analysis of the roles generalizations play. In the next section, we focus on how the
degree of certainty affects the use of generalizations in determining how evidence
should be evaluated. In Section 3, we examine the ways in which generalizations can
be classiﬁed and the differences that stem from those classiﬁcations. The legitimacy
of the common law adversary system of dispute resolution depends in some part
on an assumption that there is a cognitive consensus, an assumption that members
of society share a core of basic information and view the world in similar ways. We
describe and assess this view in Section 4. Section 5 identiﬁes the dangers that stem
fromtheuseofgeneralizations.Weconcludewithanexaminationofgeneralizations
from the practitioner’s standpoint.
2. Degrees of certainty
Perhaps all and certainly most inferences from particular to particular depend
upon an unstated generalization.2 When the usually covert generalization is made
explicit, the inductive reasoning upon which the proposed inference depends can
be translated into a quasi-deductive form, and that forces into prominence the
generalization being assumed as a major premise. However, generalizations are
usually hedged in some way:
In reasoning from E∗to E at the ﬁrst step, I might assert the following: If we have
evidence that an event occurred, this event usually (often, sometimes, frequently, etc.)
did occur. Thus I believe we have some degree of license to reason from evidence E∗to E,
the event(s) reported in the evidence. But notice that I have hedged this generalization
or warrant; I did not say: When we have this evidence that an event occurred, this event
necessarily occurred. If it is inconclusive, evidence about some event does not allow me
to say that the occurrence of the event is certain. Which hedge I choose depends upon
the strength of my own belief based upon experiences I have had in evaluating this kind
of evidence. At this stage I might say: If something like E happens then something like
F usually (often, sometimes, frequently, etc.) happens . . . (Schum, Foundations, 81–2)
If one were able to quantify the frequency of an event with reasonable conﬁdence,
one could formally convert a generalization that is hedged into the major premise
of a syllogism:
In all cases of X there is a 0.7 probability (70% likelihood) of Y
This is a case of X
Therefore Y is 0.7 probable.
2 Anderson and Schum are in the “all” camp (see pp. 100–101 above); Twining draws the line at
“certainly most.”

Analysis of Evidence
However, such estimates need to be treated with great caution: What is the basis for
the estimate? Who is making the estimate? Might it be biased, purely speculative or
otherwise unreliable? Is it an example of false precision? And so on.
However, an inference openly based on a fuzzy generalization is conspicuously
weak:
X and Y sometimes occur simultaneously
This is a case of X
Therefore Y may have occurred simultaneously.
It is important to distinguish between the strength of support for a generalization
and its probative force if it is accepted as true. Here we ﬁnd an interesting feature
of the operation of generalizations in the kind of argument with which we are
concerned: the more cautious a generalization, the more plausible it is likely to be,
but the weaker the support that it gives to the probandum.3 For example, using the
example of the disparity of age between Edith and Freddie, the generalization, “All
older women dominate all younger men in all circumstances,” would give strong
support to the probandum, “Edith dominated Freddie in all circumstances,” if it
were true. But it clearly is not true. On the other hand, a proposition such as: “In
intimate relationships the older partner tends to be the dominant partner” is more
plausible, but it is very vague and at best gives weak support to the probandum that
Edith incited Freddie to murder her husband.
Moreover, there are many other possible generalizations that might be imagined,
some pointing in the opposite direction. Consider again the differences in age
between Edith and Freddie. We could move by a number of different routes from
this fact to the intermediate probandum that Edith inﬂuenced Freddie. There are
several possible generalizations about the relations between an older woman and
a younger man. A lawyer might argue that in such relationships, for example:
(a) older women tend to dominate, (b) older women are insecure, (c) older women
are demanding, (d) older women are more inclined to take initiatives, (e) older
women play the role of a mother substitute, and so on. Each of these could provide
a signiﬁcantly different route to support or negate an argument concerning the
existence, extent, and effect of Edith’s inﬂuence over Freddie. Furthermore, each of
these generalizations could also lead to other intermediate probanda about motive
or intent or something else.
It appears from the argument that counsel for the prosecution in Bywaters and
Thompson selected (a). Why? Perhaps, because it provides stronger support for the
intermediate probandum “Edith dominated Freddie or Edith inﬂuenced Freddie.”
But upon reﬂection, perhaps backed by research, we might conclude that there is
stronger support for one of the other generalizations (b) through (e). To repeat: it
3 It is not quite correct to say that the probative force of a generalization varies inversely with
the strength of support for it, because some universal or near-universal generalizations are well
founded.

is important to distinguish between the strength of support for the generalization
and the probative force of the generalization, if it is accepted as true.
Therearefurthercomplexities.EdithandFreddiecanbecharacterizedingender-
neutral terms: as partners, lovers, persons, for example. The context can be char-
acterized in a way that hedges the generalization: in intimate relationships, in love
affairs, or more vaguely in relationships of this kind. Each of the elements could
be expressed in heavily loaded emotive terms. To give a crude example: An ageing
adulteress will manipulate a naive adolescent.
The important point here is that, for the lawyer, the choice of formulation is
crucial. The precise, speciﬁc formulation may set up an irrefutable syllogism com-
pelling the conclusion sought, if the decision-maker accepts the generalization in
that form as true. But in most cases, the generalization will not be that well estab-
lished nor that widely shared nor very precise. Probably no one believes that “All
older women dominate all younger men all of the time,” and some potential jurors
would probably reject such a generalization even in a much weaker form.
3. Types of generalizations
Generalizations can be categorized in different ways for different purposes. In
Chapter 3, we identiﬁed three axes that could be used in classifying generaliza-
tions – a generality (or level of abstraction) axis, a reliability (or degree of certainty)
axis, and a source (or basis) axis. There is a fourth axis that should also be viewed
as a part of that classiﬁcation scheme – what might be called a commonality axis.
The commonality axis refers to how widely the generalization would be accepted
or shared within the particular community in which a disputed question had to be
resolved.
At one end of the commonality spectrum are generalizations that are shared only
by a small number of people. Examples might be drawn for generalizations falling
along any of the other three axes – e.g., generalizations expressing the prejudice that
underlay the hatred that separated the Capulets and the Montagues; generaliza-
tions acquired by experience or study necessary to fully understand and accurately
evaluate the performances of world-class athletes; or the generalizations under-
stood only by astrophysicists trying to evaluate data being generated by the Hubble
telescope.
At the other end of the spectrum are generalizations that are universally or
widely shared within the relevant community. Examples clustering at this end of
the spectrum are similarly diverse – e.g., generalizations based upon prejudices of
thekindthathaveresultedin“ethniccleansing”inRwandaortheformerYugoslavia;
generalizations originally based upon scientiﬁc or mathematical principles that are
now shared generally in most communities – e.g., any object dropped will fall until
it reaches the ground or some other surface; generalizations derived from common
experience – e.g., all lighted stove burners are very hot.

Analysis of Evidence
byplacingthemalongtheaxesidentiﬁedabove.Asaresult,thecategoriescommonly
used to describe generalizations are overlapping, imprecise, and ambiguous, and
the descriptions employed often conceal, rather than disclose, differences that are
important. Nonetheless, lawyers and others who must work with generalizations
in constructing and critiquing arguments about disputed questions of fact must be
aware of the descriptions commonly used and of the roles that generalizations so
described have played and will play in such arguments and critiques.
Generalizations can be categorized in different ways for different purposes. In
the context of arguments about questions of fact, it is useful to categorize them
in terms of source and reliability. From the standpoint of a lawyer, it is useful to
distinguish between two main types: (a) case-speciﬁc generalizations contrasted
with (b) background generalizations, which in turn can be classiﬁed roughly in
terms of their reliability – scientiﬁc/expert, general knowledge, experience-based,
and synthetic-intuitive (or belief) generalizations. In the context of argumentation
in legal processes different considerations apply to each category. Generalizations
can be placed on a spectrum of reliability ranging from well-tested and generally
accepted propositions, such as those associated with the law of gravity, to largely
untested and sometimes untestable intuitions, such as the generalizations upon
which the view that running from the scene of a crime is evidence of guilt, to
unfounded biases based upon false stereotypes – such as prejudices based on gender,
race, class, or age.4
a. Case-speciﬁc generalizations
These may be used explicitly or implicitly in argument in a particular case. They
may include descriptions about personal habits or character, or local practices (how
newlybornbabiesarelabeledinthishospital),orallegationsofageneralnature,such
as “The employer-defendant in this case regularly discriminated against women in
its employment practices.”
Case-speciﬁc background knowledge may be a mixture of particular and general
information, such as Welt’s use of “local knowledge” in relation to bus time tables
and the Old Sumter Inn in “The Nine Mile Walk” (above, page 11). A composite
picture of Edith’s character as a successful businesswoman and a forceful person
might be used to bolster a generalization to the effect that she was the dominant
partner in her relationship with her lover.
Such generalizations may become operative in a speciﬁc case, although fre-
quently they remain in the background. They may be supported by explicit evidence
adduced, for example, in an employment discrimination case. But often they may

Court that women could not be admitted to the bar): “The paramount destiny and mission of
women are to fulﬁl the noble and benign ofﬁces of wife and mother. That is the law of the Creator.
And the rules of civil society must be adapted to the general constitution of things, and cannot be
based on exceptional cases” (Bradley, J., concurring at 141–42).

may have been true about sexual prejudices among jurors at the trial of Bywaters
and Thompson.5 They may be and frequently are a product of both.
Especially if they are supported by evidence, case-speciﬁc generalizations tend
to push out or trump background generalizations. For example, in Bywaters and
Thompson it was important for the prosecution to prove that Freddie’s attack on
Percywaspremeditated,forthatwouldsupportthepropositionthatheactedinpur-
suance of a conspiracy or because of Edith’s incitement. The main evidence in sup-
port of this was the highly ambiguous tea-room letter (Exhibit 60) and the fact that
he was carrying a knife. The probative value of this last fact would be considerably
weaker if it could be shown that Freddie was in the habit of carrying the knife wher-
ever he went. Freddie claimed this, but his credibility was weak. If Edith’s counsel
had called one of Freddie’s shipmates as a witness to support this case-speciﬁc gen-
eralization, that would have weakened the prosecution’s case very signiﬁcantly. In
the event, both sides had to rely on contradictory or divergent background gen-
eralizations. The prosecution argued that “Possession of a knife of this kind was
in itself suspicious,” and that “No reasonable man living in London carries a knife
like this in his pocket.” The defense argued: “It is not strange for a seafaring man
visiting foreign countries, to purchase a knife,” and “There are few sailors who do
not possess a knife.” (See Figure 10.1.) A witness-backed case-speciﬁc generalization
about Freddy’s habits in this respect would have been much more persuasive than
any of these background generalizations.6
The evidence necessary to establish many case-speciﬁc generalizations will ordi-
narily be admitted automatically. Edith was 28, Freddie was 20, and both sat before
the jury. It is difﬁcult to see how counsel for the defense could have prevented the
jury from learning that “Edith is older than Freddie.” In such a circumstance, coun-
sel must determine what generalizations this fact may evoke in the jurors’ minds
(e.g., “older women dominate younger men”) and how to enhance or diminish their
effect. Often important case-speciﬁc generalizations may have to be established by
evidence.
It is also possible that evidence might be adduced to enhance or diminish the
strength of generalizations that might otherwise be held or accepted by the triers
of fact. For example, psychologists might today be employed to examine Edith and
Freddie and, on that basis, might be able to express an opinion about whether
Edith did or could inﬂuence Freddie’s conduct in important matters. Similarly,
social science survey techniques might conceivably today enable lawyers to produce
evidence as to what proportion of seafaring men habitually carried knives in their
coat pockets. The attempt to prove such case-speciﬁc generalizations raises an array

commentators.
6 Anderson (1999) also uses the term “context-speciﬁc” generalizations to refer to background gen-
eralizations that have been made more concrete in the context of a particular case. This is different

of problems concerning availability, admissibility, and utility that are frequently
treated in standard texts on evidence and trial practice. However, it is quite unre-
alistic to expect to use experts for the great majority of propositions used in argu-
ments about judicial evidence, even when there is potentially applicable scientiﬁc
material.
b. Background generalizations
Karl Llewellyn wrote:
[W]hen Michael and Adler divided knowledge into two essential categories: “common
sense” and “scientiﬁc knowledge,” they overlooked . . . that the matter does not thus
cleave neatly into two signiﬁcant areas, but that it stretches out or sprawls instead
between two poles. At the one pole is ignorance and pure guess. At the other pole
is solid and thoroughly systematized scientiﬁc knowledge. “Common sense” is, so to
speak, in the South Temperate Zone. Uncommon sense, ordered, pondered on with
care, and tested out once and again in inconclusive but still illuminating corrective
careful tests – that is so to speak, in the North Temperate Zone. Knowledge does not
have to be scientiﬁc, in order to be on the way toward Science. Neither does it have to
be scientiﬁc in order to be extremely useful. (Llewellyn (1936) 22)
In the absence of experts or other direct evidence, we fall back on background
generalizations. In the Rationalist Tradition it is assumed that the triers of fact,
including jurors, come already equipped with a largely shared “stock of knowl-
edge,” which is the main source of warrants for making inferences in arguments
about questions of fact. This equipment is commonly described as “general experi-
ence,”“backgroundknowledge,”“commonsense,”or“society’sstockofknowledge.”
Again we need to ask, whose experience, sense, or knowledge? As we shall see, each
of these expressions is somewhat misleading if it is used to refer to the totality
of the individual and communal beliefs that are used as warrants for inferential
reasoning.
What is advanced as knowledge, common sense, or shared beliefs is too var-
ied to be susceptible to precise classiﬁcation. The bases for such generalizations
are as varied as the sources for the beliefs themselves – education, direct experi-
ence, the media, gossip, ﬁction, fantasy, speculation, prejudice, and so on. In legal
contexts it is useful to draw broad distinctions between different kinds of general-
izations according to their perceived reliability in a given society at a given time,
bearing in mind that there is a continuum that ranges from uncontested scientiﬁc
truths, through “knowledge” based on more or less established forms of expertise,
to largely uncontested general knowledge, to less established “common sense” gen-
eralizations, to beliefs that are based on limited experience, faith, speculation, myth,
or prejudice. Although these are quite rough categories, it is important to realize
that they can operate quite differently in arguments about questions of fact in legal
contexts.

Analysis of Evidence
c. Scientiﬁc knowledge and expertise
Scientiﬁc generalizations are based upon scientiﬁc knowledge and research. They
vary in terms of their reliability. There are those based upon the “laws of science”
(e.g., the applications of the law of gravity to prove how long it took the victim’s
body to strike the sidewalk after he was pushed out of the sixteenth-story window).
There are those based upon well-established principles (e.g., the body of scientiﬁc
knowledge upon which ﬁngerprint identiﬁcation is based). There are those extrap-
olated from research ﬁndings that are less well-established or are recognized as less
reliable (e.g., voice print identiﬁcation or the nature of the relationship between
prenatal smoking and birth defects). Typically, these are generalizations that are
established by expert witnesses who testify both as to one or more case-speciﬁc
generalization, that are relevant (e.g., to establish that the deceased died at 4:30
p.m.) and, if required, to the scientiﬁc generalizations that support that conclusion.
The courts have come to rely increasingly on scientiﬁc and other expert evi-
dence. This in turn has generated problems about the qualiﬁcations of experts,
the probative helpfulness of expert evidence, how to deal with novel and contested
“scientiﬁc” ﬁndings, the role of experts in testifying directly to ultimate and penul-
timate probanda (“the ultimate issue” problem), and the tensions between the
fallibilism of science and the need for ﬁnality in adjudication.7 It was estimated
that by 1990 over 70 percent of civil jury trials in the United States involved expert
evidence and the proportion has been growing. DNA and other advances in foren-
sic science and technology have already made a profound impact on the investi-
gation and prosecution of crimes and alleged miscarriages of justice. This trend
is bound to continue. The leading comparative law scholar, Mirjan Damaska, has
predicted:
Let there be no mistake. As science continues to change the social world, great transfor-
mations of factual inquiry lie ahead for all justice systems. These transformations could
turn out to be as momentous as those that occurred in the twilight of the Middle Ages,
when magical forms of proof retreated before the prototypes of our present evidentiary
technology.8

will simply appear in argument without any formal request that they be noticed.
Many will fall under the doctrine of judicial notice (see below). Others may require
some proof, but all share the characteristic that they will be accepted as largely
indisputable at the time and place of the trial.9
e. Experience-based generalizations
Sometimes people conﬁdently claim to “know” something on the basis of ﬁrsthand
experience. Some such experience-based generalizations may be widely shared in
a community. Some may be based on extensive ﬁrsthand experience (Llewellyn’s
idea of “horse sense”).10 Most Miami residents have learned from experience that
torrential rain showers may fall with little advance indication. Others are individual
generalizations, based on isolated events, sometimes involving unwarranted extrap-
olations from individual experiences. For example, someone who has been unfairly
treated by the police may, rightly or wrongly, conclude that all or most police ofﬁcers
are not to be trusted. If the individual is a juror, the generalization may affect the
outcome, irrespective of its validity. Someone who has had an unpleasant experi-
ence with someone from another race or class may develop negative views about all
members of that race or class. Such beliefs are best treated as unwarranted beliefs
or prejudices rather than as being genuinely based on experience.
f. Synthetic-intuitive generalizations (belief generalizations)
Many “common sense” generalizations can be usefully categorized as beliefs that a
person synthesizes or intuits from her stock of knowledge and beliefs. Sometimes an
individual can explain the sources from which she synthesized the generalization.
Frequently, however, the intuitive predominates – the individual cannot identify
the source of the generalization or explain why she believes that it is sound.
The generalizations necessary to support the inferences that ﬂight from the scene
of a crime is evidence of guilt are examples of “synthetic-intuitive” generalizations.
We are not aware of any tests that claim to have veriﬁed these generalizations.
Nonetheless, the generalization “persons who have committed a crime often ﬂee
from the scene of that crime” seems intuitively right – at least to some middle class
people.11 In its weakest form, we might accept the transposed generalization upon
9 Of course, what passes for knowledge in a given society at a particular time may later be shown
to be untrue. For example, in an earlier era, it was “generally known” that the earth was ﬂat.
In an appropriate case, evidence that a person was on a ship that was last seen sailing over
the horizon might have been sufﬁcient to establish that the person was dead. To talk of beliefs
“passing for” knowledge at different times involves no commitment to a strong relativist position
in epistemology. On “the passes for fallacy” (the fallacy that because what passes for the truth is
often no such thing, it follows that there is no objective truth), see Haack (1998) 93.
10 “Horse-sense is the kind of highly informed, distinctly uncommon, better-than-common, expert
but not scientiﬁcally demonstrable know-what and know-how which a David Harum had about
horses and other horse-traders” (Llewellyn, unpublished manuscript (1950) cited in Twining
(1973) 503).
11 Note that if someone sees another person running in the vicinity of an event, such as a ﬁght or
motor accident, to call it “ﬂight” involves an inference: the person could be running to somewhere

Analysis of Evidence
which ﬂight inferences depend, “persons who ﬂee from the scene of a crime are
sometimes persons who are guilty of that crime.” The generalization thus framed
could provide only weak support for an inference that the person seen ﬂeeing from
the scene of a speciﬁc crime was the person who committed that crime: “That
person may be the person who committed the crime.” There often seems to be no
clear basis for our acceptance of these generalizations, apart from a synthesis or an
intuition based upon our personal “stock of knowledge” or “common sense.” This
is clearly fallible, but it may be all that we have to rely on.12
One of the claims for Wigmorean analysis is that by making explicit what is
usually left implicit it readily exposes weak points in argument. In marking stu-
dents’ exercises in this kind of analysis, we regularly look for non sequiturs in their
arguments. Very often the non sequitur is based on a faulty generalization, like the
one in Figure 10.2.
X was carrying a weapon. 
X entered the victim's garage.
G: Persons/strangers who enter other 
persons' garages usually/often/frequently 
carry weapons.
Figure 10.2 Foolish generalizations
This generalization, once articulated, would seem absurd on its face to most
people. Constructing generalizations to show disconnects in chains of reasoning is
a very useful device when evaluating an argument.
(e.g. to summon help), running from the scene or running past it, for example, a jogger who
happened to be passing near the scene of the event when it happened. Some people might interpret
running from the police as good sense rather than an indication of guilt.
12 A fairly representative statement of the orthodox view is as follows: “More often assumed than
articulated is the premise that jurors must rely on common sense, or the knowledge and experience
which they share with the community generally. But ‘common sense’ is frequently wrong . . . Our
everyday experience of the world comes in crude, unrepresentative chunks, with causal relations
hopelessly obscured, and with prejudice, superstition, and self-interest inextricably intertwined
in perception” (Bitterman (1956) A-16). “This is no argument for not using common sense. We
operate in judicial institutions with the best we have and the inescapable necessity of making
concessions to the shortness of life” (Levin and Levy (1956) 141–42).
