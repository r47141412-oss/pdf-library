Analysis of Evidence
it specify with precision each step in each argument being advanced. This makes
it possible to appraise each argument rigorously. Third, it provides a method of
marshaling all the relevant and potentially relevant data in a complex case into a
single, coherent, and clear structure in the form of an argument.
The use of symbols and charting is, in our view, necessary to realize all three
advantages simultaneously and to realize the second and third fully. The chart is
a graphic depiction of the arguments in a case-as-a-whole (or of a complex set of
argumentsbearingonaparticularaspectofacase).Thespeciﬁcargumentsadvanced
and their support are shown in a form that makes it simple to see and appraise the
structure and content of the arguments being advanced. The chart also makes it
possible to specify the evidence and arguments likely to be advanced in opposition
or available for corroboration in a form that facilitates analysis and appraisal of the
parts and the whole of the speciﬁc argument under study and its relationship to
other arguments in the case-as-a-whole. In short, the chart and key-list are devices
that make it possible to present all the evidence and arguments in a form that
facilitates analysis, understanding, and appraisal.
Wigmore’s chart method of analysis, as we have modiﬁed it, serves the same
functions and has the same advantages as the symbols and related methods of anal-
ysis established in other ﬁelds.15 It facilitates understanding, analysis, and appraisal
precisely because it employs a format that focuses upon the precise steps in the
arguments advanced and makes it possible to depict the results of the analysis of a
complex problem in a concise form. In our view, a method that employs symbols
and charting is the only method that makes it possible to present all the arguments
in a case in a form and format that enhances clarity and understanding and that
best facilitates rigorous appraisal and critique.
Any system that satisﬁes the necessary conditions for analyzing and charting
the available evidence in a case will, in its nature, involve complexity and require
considerable effort for mastery and application. Computer drawing systems and
other systems under development may well reduce the now formidable mechanical
effort required to draw and revise the charts for a complex case in much the same
way that word processing software has reduced the mechanical effort necessary to
construct and revise complex documents. Those efforts will not, however, signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the amount of intellectual skill and energy necessary to conduct the
analysis and marshal the resulting arguments.

The chart method

The exercise continues: State v. Archer (III)
1. Defense counsel’s standpoint
Preparation of Archer’s defense to the charge he murdered Vern continues. [Review
the facts already developed and analyzed in the exercise on State v. Archer (II)
(page 109) above.] The statement made by Archer at his initial interview included
the following extracts:
On the Sunday on which Vern was murdered, I spent the day at home. It rained all day
so I worked around the house and read the Times. I went to dinner at a neighborhood
restaurant around 6:00 p.m. I returned shortly after 7:00 p.m. and watched television. I
went to bed after the 10 o’clock news. I slept till 7:30 Monday morning. Because it was
still raining, I did not arrive at work till 10:30 a.m. . . .
. . . I have never owned a brown Harris tweed jacket, and I don’t know how the jacket
Detective Paul found came to be in my closet . . .
. . . I invited two couples from my ofﬁce and my girlfriend to my house for dinner
on Saturday evening. The party lasted till about 11:00 p.m. No one visited me at home
on Sunday or Monday. Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Boswell, Uncle Vern’s former partner,
called. He said Detective Paul had interviewed him and had also interviewed Mr. Carl.
Carl and Vern had been friends until Carl’s sister committed suicide when Uncle Vern
refused to marry her. Boswell suggested the three of us should get together. I invited
them to stop by that evening after dinner for drinks. They came around 9:00 p.m. and
stayed till 11:00 p.m. I guess they just wanted to reassure me that, even though each of
them hated the old skinﬂint, neither had murdered him. We all felt vulnerable because
each of us had stayed home alone that Sunday . . .
. . . I don’t recall exactly what Boswell or Carl was wearing, but I do recall that it was
a crisp, chilly evening and that they were wearing coats and jackets when they arrived.
I think I would have noticed if either had left without his coat . . .
You have since received a copy of the coroner’s report, which ﬁxes the time of Vern’s
death between 11:00 p.m. and midnight Sunday.
For the moment, your analysis continues to focus upon the scrap of cloth and the
jacket and the circumstances in which each was found. The ultimate probandum
remains: “It was Archer who murdered Vern.” You obviously want to obtain and
present evidence that will preclude the jury’s ﬁnding that proposition to have been
proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
a Using the prosecution’s propositions developed for State v. Archer (II) (with any
amendments you now think appropriate), identify and frame the penultimate and
strategic propositions you think the prosecutor will attempt to support with the
evidential propositions relevant to the scrap of cloth, the jacket, and the
circumstances in which each was found. Again, with such revisions as now appear
necessary, do a preliminary chart showing the relationship between these
propositions. (Polishing the chart comes later.)

Analysis of Evidence
b As defense counsel, the rival probandum for the defense is: “It was someone other
than Archer who murdered Vern.”16 Archer’s statement read with Paul’s can be
analyzed from two standpoints: It suggests several hypotheses that should be
investigated, but it also provides certain facts to which Archer can testify directly.
Obviously, you must be concerned with both standpoints, but before planning the
further investigations, we must analyze the evidential data in hand.
i Formulate your standpoint as counsel for the defense. State and number the
ultimate probandum and penultimate probanda the prosecution must prove.
Formulate the strongest theory for the prosecution and for the defense. Add any
defense propositions that would directly undermine one or more of the
penultimate probanda that the prosecution must prove.
ii Identify and formulate a defense key-list of evidential propositions available from
Archer’s and Paul’s statements that appear relevant to explain away, deny, or rival
the inferences the prosecution may seek to establish. Identify and formulate as
simple propositions the circumstantial inferences your evidential propositions
suggest. Order these propositions as best you can and number each. (It may
simplify the charting task if you use different numbers from those used to label
the prosecution propositions you have identiﬁed and formulated – for instance, if
you have 25 prosecution propositions, start your defense list with number 50 and
proceed.) Label each proposition opponent’s explanation (OE), opponent’s
rivalry (OR), or opponent’s denial (OD).
iii Chart the propositions on the key-list, ﬁrst to depict the strongest argument for
the prosecution; then depict the strongest arguments for the defense to
undermine the prosecution’s argument and to develop a rival theory adopted for
the defense. Depict the additions to the prosecution chart made by adding
symbols for your propositions to the chart.
2. Defense investigation
Now formulate as hypotheses the additional intermediate probanda that will guide
your investigation. What, if any, additional questions do you have for Archer? Or for
Paul (assuming he would respond)? What information do you need from or about
Boswell? Carl? Assuming time and resources are limited, how would you organize
the investigation?
16 Evidence supporting this rival proposition need only make it a plausible hypothesis to demonstrate
that the evidence cannot be marshaled to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was Archer
who murdered Vern.

Outlines, chronologies, and narrative
The outline method of analysis and its variants are more familiar to practicing
lawyers. They have the advantage that they are easier to use than the chart method,
althoughitishardertomaintaintherigorthatthechartmethodrequires.Inaddition
to these two methods of analysis, there are two analytic devices in common use,
narrativesandchronologies,thatcomplementandfacilitatetheuseofbothmethods
of analysis. In Part A of this chapter, we describe and illustrate the outline method
of analysis. In Part B, we describe the analytic devices and discuss their utility. In
Part C, we discuss how and with what effect the methods and devices can be used at
various stages of a litigated case. In Part D, we describe the essential tools by which
the products of an analysis may be converted into forms useful to a lawyer at any
stage of a case.
A. The outline method of analysis
One of the strengths of the outline method is its utility in organizing the evidence
and arguments. In the outline, each of the penultimate probanda is a main heading
in the outline. For example in the Simpson case, the outline would begin:
I NBS is dead.
II NBS died as the result of an unlawful act.
III It was OJS who committed the act that caused NBS’s death.
IV The person who committed the acts that caused NBS’s death acted with malice
aforethought.
Given the prosecution’s provisional theory of the case, the central fact in dis-
pute was the third penultimate probandum. The outline under that heading might
continue:
III It was OJS who committed the act that caused NBS’s death.
A The Physical Evidence: OJS was present at the scene when the act was committed.
B Motive: OJS had motive to kill NBS.
C Opportunity: OJS could have committed the murder.
1 NBS was murdered at 10:15 p.m. or shortly thereafter.

Analysis of Evidence
a The plaintive wail of NBS’s Akita dog establishes that NBS and RLG were
murdered at approximately 10:15 p.m. on June 12.
i PF testimony, I heard the plaintive wail of a dog at 10:15 p.m. on June 12.
ii It was NBS’s dog that wailed.
(a) Other residents testiﬁed that they found a white Akita dog with blood
on its paws.
(b) Other witnesses testiﬁed that the Akita belonged to NBS.
iii Generalization: It is highly likely that a dog that discovers its owner’s
bloody body will begin wailing plaintively.
2 OJS had 35 to 40 minutes between the time NBS and RLG were murdered and
the time he emerged from his house for a limousine ride to the airport.
a The murder was committed at 10:15 p.m. (See III.C.1)
b OJS came out of his house to go to the airport at 11:00 p.m., dressed in
stone-washed jeans and a white-collared shirt with a black coat, with no
visible evidence of blood or other signs that he had been in a struggle.
c It takes about ﬁve minutes to drive at the speed limit from NBS’s townhouse to
OJS’s house (Vannatter).
3 Generalization: 40 to 45 minutes is almost certainly enough time for a murderer
who stabbed two victims to death to drive to his home ﬁve minutes from the
scene of the crime and to remove and pack the blood-stained clothing he had
worn at the scene, without leaving signiﬁcant trace evidence, and to shower,
dress, and compose himself for a trip.
a OJS could have driven from NBS’s condominium to his house, removed and
packed the blood-stained clothing he had worn at the scene, without leaving
signiﬁcant trace evidence, showered and dressed and composed himself for a
trip in less than 45 minutes.
The provisional outline of Point III is incomplete. The outline could be expanded
to account for all of the relevant evidential data and organized to show how it
supports the penultimate probanda in the case, and conventions could be adopted
that would make it possible to enter propositions that tend to explain away or rival
the inferences supporting proposition III. If the outline is started at the outset of a
case, it can readily be updated as new information is obtained by the insertion of
additional propositions. As a working tool it is far easier to maintain and update an
outline than it is to do and re-do a chart.
Exercise
In the Simpson case, Kato Kaelin testiﬁed he heard three loud thumps on the wall
outside his bedroom in back of the house at approximately 10:45 p.m. Alan Park
testiﬁed that he saw a six-foot African-American male weighing about 200 pounds
dressed in dark clothing enter the house 5 or 6 minutes before OJS emerged to go to
the airport. On cross-examination, Mr. Park acknowledged that the person he saw

might have been dressed in a black robe.1 How would you include these statements
and the inferences they support in the outline supporting proposition III.C?
B. Analytic devices: chronologies and narratives
Chronologies can be used to test completeness of an analysis at any stage of an
investigation. In most cases, it is useful to construct three kinds of chronologies –
witness-by-witness chronologies, document and other tangible evidence chronolo-
gies, and a master chronology. A witness chronology puts every event to which
a witness could testify in chronological order. This serves three purposes. It pro-
vides a basis for assessing the completeness and consistency of the witness’s likely
testimony. Are there additional facts that this witness should know? Are there ambi-
guities or inconsistencies that need to be clariﬁed and resolved? Second, it provides
a basis from which the lawyer can identify ways in which the witness’s testimony
can be presented in the most dramatically and strategically effective way. Where
does this witness’s testimony ﬁt in the story to be established (or refuted) at trial?
Can it be organized to present a coherent and dramatically effective chapter in that
story? Third, the witness (and tangible evidence) chronologies provide the basis for
constructing the master chronology.
In most cases the documents or other items of tangible evidence will be used
to establish or conﬁrm that an event occurred. The check Richard Able cashed on
December 20, 2001, establishes that Able received $25,000 income prior to the end
of the 2001 tax year. It also could be used to establish that Able was in Las Vegas on
that date. In some cases, the date on which a document or other item of tangible
evidence was prepared or discovered may be important. For example, the date on
which a deposition was taken or a letter written may be crucial, apart from their
contents, if either is offered as a prior consistent statement to rebut a charge of recent
fabrication or improper motive. The statements in such a document may be used
to establish the truth of the matter asserted only if the statement were made prior
to the date on which the motive to fabricate arose.2 The fact that Detective Paul
found the brown Harris tweed jacket in Archer’s closet only two days after Vern had
been murdered limits the period during which Archer could claim that the jacket
was left there by someone else. A tangible evidence chronology provides the other
basis for constructing the master chronology. It also may provide conﬁrmation for
an event to which a witness may testify, and it may identify gaps or inconsistencies
in a witness’s testimony that need to be ﬁlled or resolved.
The master chronology places all events that are or may be relevant to the case in
the order in which they occurred. At the early stages of a case, it enables the analyst
to identify gaps that require further investigation and hypotheses that should be

Analysis of Evidence
explored.Atthelaterstagesofacase,itbecomesadevicefortestingthecompleteness
of the chart or outline the analyst has prepared. Throughout, it is a device for
recording evidential propositions that should be considered in constructing a key-
list or an outline. At any stage, it provides the basis for identifying story possibilities
in the evidence.
The narrative, as an analytical device, can be used to construct logical stories
that could be supported by the evidence. A narrative is a device that complements,
but cannot substitute for, a detailed analysis. Once the analyst has identiﬁed and
reﬁned her ultimate and penultimate probanda and has developed her provisional
theory of the case and constructed a master chronology and a key-list and chart
or a detailed outline, the logical story possibilities for each side are ordinarily easy
to identify. In using the narrative as an analytical tool, the analyst is interested in
constructing stories that order the evidence so that it logically supports her theory
of the case.
In early stages of an investigation, the narrative further assists the analyst in
identifying gaps that must be ﬁlled in order to present evidence that supports the
narrative. It also further enables her to use the narrative to identify hypotheses to
be explored. In the later stages, the analyst will seek to construct a story that is
supported by and accounts for all of the evidence she intends to present to the
decision-maker and one that cannot be effectively undermined by the evidence she
anticipates her opponent will present. Ultimately, the objective is to create a story
that the fact-ﬁnder will accept as the most plausible (or, for the prosecution in a
criminal case, the only plausible) story of what happened that is supported by the
evidence.
The analyst must, however, be able to identify the logical weaknesses of the
narrative that she proposes to adopt and of the narrative that she anticipates her
opponent is likely to craft. The objective is to develop a persuasive narrative that
is not only consistent with and supported by the evidence, but that also minimizes
the possible points on which it is vulnerable to attack. She must also identify the
weaknesses of her opponent’s anticipated narrative account in order to plan how
she can persuade the fact-ﬁnder that it is ﬂawed or in any event less plausible than
the narrative she advocates. It is the atomistic analysis developed through the chart
or outline methods that makes this possible.
Exercise
1 In Simpson, the prosecutor’s narrative argued that the African American male in dark
clothing who entered the house ﬁve or six minutes before OJS emerged at 11:00 p.m.
was OJS returning from NBS’s condominium, the scene of the crime.3 Based upon the
analysis you developed for the preceding exercise, account for these facts in a narrative

that provides greater support for proposition III.C and that is less vulnerable to
attack.
2 From the evidence available in United States v. Able, it would be a simple matter for
the prosecution to develop a narrative that would support a headline statement of the
theory: “High Liver Comes on Hard Times; Lawyer Turned Law Professor Cheats on
Taxes to Maintain Exciting Lifestyle.” It would be equally simple for the defense to
develop a narrative that would support the headline: “Government Prosecutes
Innocent Taxpayer for Accountant’s Error.” Each has signiﬁcant weaknesses that
opposing counsel could use to attack it. Develop the narratives and then identify the
signiﬁcant weaknesses in each. Could the prosecution develop a revised theory of the
case and a different narrative that were equally strong, but that are less vulnerable to
attack? Could the defense? How?
C. The litigation context
The chart and outline methods of analysis are complementary. The initial analysis
is likely to employ the outline method. The penultimate probanda are the main
headingsintheoutline.Ifthequestionis,“Dowehaveenoughinformationtojustify
ﬁling a complaint?” an outline is frequently the most effective way to organize the
available and the anticipated data. As a device, the master chronology is a key-list
of evidential propositions ordered chronologically. The ordering makes it possible
to see conﬂicts and gaps without preparing a chart. It also makes it possible to
transform the evidence and possible inferences into a narrative account. Outlines,
chronologies, and narratives are ﬂuid; each can readily be updated and revised to
account for new evidence as it becomes available. The chart method, however, is
static: It is the most rigorous method for determining and assessing, at a particular
point in time, the extent to which the evidence can be marshaled to support or
undermine an ultimate probandum, but its products will remain the most time-
consuming to develop and revise. Against that background, we discuss the uses and
limits of the methods and the devices at various stages of litigation.
1. The stages of a case and the methods of analysis
Deﬁning the protocols for the methods of analysis does not answer three practical
questions of considerable importance. Which methods and devices are most useful
for recording the products of analysis over time as the case develops? At what stages
is a complete analysis worthwhile? Which method of analysis is likely to be most
useful at each of those stages?
Logical analysis is required at all stages from initial interview through settlement,
trial, or appeal. Most ofﬁce procedures used by lawyers have as one of their pur-
poses recording particular aspects of the analysis in a retrievable and usable form.
A memorandum documenting the results of an interview reports facts that the
lawyer thinks may be relevant. An outline for a deposition sets forth areas in which

Analysis of Evidence
the lawyer has concluded that the deponent may be able to testify or provide other
informationthatwillleadtoevidencethatisrelevanttofactsthatmustbeestablished
to support or confound the possible ultimate probandum that has been identiﬁed.
The memorandum of law is a device by which lawyers typically document the
research necessary to enable them to frame or revise the potential ultimate proban-
dum in a case. The case ﬁle itself is a device for compiling and maintaining such
products in an organized manner. Good lawyers have systems for maintaining case
ﬁles that are designed to organize the information in a form that facilitates ongoing
analysis. From this perspective, all these are subordinate devices for analysis.
An outline that organizes the available evidence by penultimate probanda is a
device that enables the lawyer to determine the state and sufﬁciency of the available
evidence at any stage. The form may differ, but the basic requirement for such a
device is that it serves as a precise index. It must identify each element that must
be proved under the theory provisionally adopted and each witness and exhibit
that is thought relevant to establishing or confounding that element. It should
also include a summary description of the evidence that the witness or exhibit
is expected to .provide that is relevant to that element. It should identify each
of the intermediate probanda, each item of evidential data that is, alone or in
combination, necessary to show the logical relation of the item to the penultimate
probandum it supports. Such an outline is an adaptable tool. Information provided
by new witnesses or documents can be inserted as discovered, and the lawyer can use
the device to identify particular necessary elements for which the evidence seems
inadequate or altogetherlacking and to determine where investigative efforts should
be concentrated.
At various stages, systematic analysis of the evidence for the case-as-a-whole
is also necessary. Most lawyers would probably agree that there are at least three
stages in a litigated case at which such systematic analysis is appropriate – before
the ﬁrst factual pleading is ﬁled, before the decision to forego further discovery
or investigation is made, and before the case is tried. In the ﬁrst stage, the outline
method is ordinarily sufﬁcient. The importance of the decisions that must be made
at the latter two stages may make it necessary that the chart method be employed.
We examine the ﬁrst two stages in some detail and describe methods of analysis that
seem appropriate for each. We comment upon ﬁnal trial preparation only brieﬂy
here, reserving a more detailed description for Chapter 12.
a. The pleading stage
Before the complaint or indictment is ﬁled, the lawyer for the plaintiff or the gov-
ernment should be satisﬁed that facts can be alleged that, if proved, would justify
a favorable judgment as a matter of law. The lawyer should also have a reasoned
basis for believing that she has, or is likely to be able to obtain, evidential data that
support each of the necessary allegations. These data should be at least sufﬁcient to
withstand a motion to dismiss the complaint or for judgment on the pleadings. In
order to frame the complaint, the lawyer must have a provisional theory or theories

Outlines, chronologies, and narrative
151
of the case. That is, the lawyer must have identiﬁed one or more propositions of
substantive law; in light of the information available, she must have framed one
or more ultimate probanda that would bring the case within the scope of the legal
rule or rules identiﬁed; and she must have a reasoned basis for concluding that the
available facts, if accepted, would logically entitle the plaintiff or the government
to the relief sought. Even under notice-pleading rules, the plaintiff or prosecuting
authority must, at a minimum, allege the ultimate facts necessary to justify the out-
come sought. These allegations are, in effect, the penultimate probanda necessary
to support the theory or theories of the case provisionally adopted. Cost-beneﬁt
analysis reinforces the professional standards that require the lawyer to have a good
faith basis for believing that there is evidential data available sufﬁcient to sup-
port each of the necessary allegations before suit is ﬁled or speciﬁc defenses are
asserted.
On the other hand, time constraints and inaccessibility usually combine with
cost considerations to make it impracticable to develop and analyze the evidential
data fully before ﬁling the ﬁrst pleading. Much of the potential evidence may be
obtainable only through discovery, and one function of the pleadings is to deﬁne
the disputed issues of fact, in order that the parties and the court do not devote
needless time to considering facts that are not in dispute. Nonetheless, at this stage,
the lawyer should have rather carefully articulated statements of the provisionally
adopted ultimate probandum or probanda and should have identiﬁed and articu-
lated the provisional penultimate strategic probanda for each. The questions then
become: What evidential data do I have that support the inferences necessary to
argue that each of the penultimate probanda has been proved? From what sources
do I reasonably think I can obtain the additional evidence necessary to establish or
strengthen the required inferences?4
Many lawyers use an outline format for this stage. The ultimate probandum, the
penultimateprobanda,andthesupportingintermediateandevidentialpropositions
are organized in outline form, albeit in a somewhat summary fashion. The concern
here is the sufﬁciency of the allegations and the existence of a good faith basis for
believing they are provable.
b. Before the close of discovery and investigation
Intheearlystagesofadisputeandthroughouttheinvestigativestages,abductiverea-
soning is at least as important as inductive and deductive reasoning. Like Kemelman
in “The Nine Mile Walk” (above, page 11) or the police cadet in “An investigation”
(above, page 40), the lawyer is a detective looking for possibilities suggested by the
evidence or the nature of the case. In the early stages, the real danger is that the
lawyer will settle too quickly upon a single theory of the case and, often for that
reason, will fail to identify or consider additional sources of evidence that might be
4 The lawyer should also have memoranda documenting the legal research and analyses that support
what have been identiﬁed as the controlling propositions of law from which the ultimate probanda
have been derived.

Analysis of Evidence
explored. No analytic devices can be a substitute for the creative thought needed
during this (or other) phases of a case, but they can aid the lawyer in seeing gaps
and weaknesses that may warrant further investigative effort.
These dangers indicate the need for a comprehensive and structured analysis
before the investigative phase ends or is abandoned. Is there sufﬁcient evidence with
respect to each necessary element of the ultimate probandum to withstand a motion
for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff’s, prosecutor’s, or defendant’s case?
Can the evidential data be organized to support a compelling argument that each of
the elements has been proven to the required standard? Have any possible sources
of important data been overlooked? The lawyer must have a means of answering
each of these questions in a rigorous fashion before the opportunity for further
investigation ends.
It is at this point that a comprehensive and detailed method is necessary. The
outline – expanded to include every signiﬁcant proposition that would appear on a
key-list – is a necessary device for responding to the ﬁrst question and may provide
signiﬁcant aid in responding to the second and third. The chart method is for some,
including the authors, a device for depicting the logical relationships among the
propositions in a manner that permits more rigorous analysis and appraisal. In
many cases, micro-charts of crucial points coupled with a detailed outline might
sufﬁce. For example, the evidential data bearing on OJS’s opportunity would have
been and still is a good candidate for a detailed charted analysis.
Application of one or both of these methods also provides the foundation for
a more rigorous use of narrative. A narrative, in this context, provides a method
for reorganizing the data in a form that enables the lawyers involved to make a
reasoned judgment concerning the second inquiry: Can the available evidential data
be organized and presented in a form that makes a compelling logical argument for
the result sought? A narrative forces the lawyer to organize and present the analysis
in a familiar form. Placing aside rhetorical devices and dramatic organization, the
narrative method is designed to organize the evidence into a coherent story that is
logically supported by the evidence, which will enable the lawyer to assess whether
a jury would be likely to understand and, more important, be persuaded by the
theory it is intended to illustrate.5
c. Final trial preparation
If the analysis justiﬁes a decision to end the investigative phase, the lawyer has
presumably prepared the analysis upon which she will rely at trial. All the data
have been analyzed, and the inferences have been organized in relationship to the
ultimate probandum. The data are as complete as possible or feasible. What remains

additional strategic and practical functions when the task is organizing the data
for trial or other use. These functions and the other devices typically employed in
trial preparation are sufﬁciently important that they are developed more fully in
Chapter 12.
A further point should be emphasized. The utility of the chronologies and nar-
ratives is not limited to ﬁnal trial preparation. They may be employed at any stage
for appraisal and to facilitate translating the current state of the analysis into a
statement that facilitates use in other aspects of a case – in counseling a client about
the strengths and weaknesses of the case; in stimulating imaginative reasoning at
the investigative stages of a case; in persuading opposing counsel that a favorable
settlement is in the best interests of the opposing party; in identifying additional
witnesses or other evidence that might strengthen a case; or in persuading a judge
that the case requires a trial on the merits. Moreover, the notion of “narrative” and
the related notions of “theory of a case,” “story,” and “theme” are featured today
in many contemporary discussions of litigation theory and practice. Consideration
of the methods and devices and their utility requires preliminary consideration of
these related ideas also.
D. Theories, themes, stories, and situation-types
In order to prepare or to present a case, counsel for each of the parties must develop
a strong logical theory of the case. In most cases, especially those to be tried by a jury,
counsel must develop recurring themes that will serve as points of emphasis and
reinforcement with respect to crucial parts of the case. In each case, counsel must
use the theory adopted and the themes identiﬁed to construct a compelling story
of what the evidence in the case shows. In most cases, counsel will be better able to
develop and test their theories, themes, and stories by identifying and describing a
general situation into which the case ﬁts as illustrated by the story that reinforces
the need to ﬁnd the facts in a way that supports the result counsel seeks. We discuss
these concepts in greater detail in chapters that follow. For present purposes, we
need to draw fairly precise distinctions between four notions and identify the ways
in which methods of analysis contribute to their development.
The theory of a case, in advocacy, is the logical statement of the case-as-a-whole
selected by counsel from the available alternatives, in light of opposing counsel’s
anticipated theory and in light of counsel’s choice as to theme and story. The theory
should be capable of statement in the form of a series of syllogisms that demonstrate
that the desired conclusion is necessarily true, given the controlling legal principle
and the available evidence and assuming the truth of the proposed inferences.
The theory of the case is a product of analysis. For the Wigmorean lawyer, the
key-list and chart enable her to test her provisional theories and revise those theories
until she has settled on the theory that provides strongest support for her client’s
position and is least vulnerable to attack by opposing counsel, the theory that will
enable her to marshal the evidence that provides the strongest support for the

Analysis of Evidence
conclusion that the ultimate probandum has (or has not) been proved. The theory
adopted must be capable of statement in logical form. The lawyer should be able
to organize the data and marshal the arguments in syllogistic form to demonstrate
that, if all of the generalizations upon which the required inferences depend are
valid, the ultimate probandum must be accepted as proven to a certainty (or as
incapable of being proven to the required degree of certainty). In that sense the
theory of the case is a matter to be tested by logic.6
Theme: An English barrister described the theme of a case better than we could:
Having decided on a theory, you must pick a theme to ﬁt that theory. You must have two
goals in mind: First, why the other side is responsible for what happened and second,
why your client is not. For example, big business at its intolerant and unimaginative
worst; on the other hand, no one is perfect; there is a limit to the care and foresight
which the ordinary man like your client cannot be expected to possess, etc.7
Frequently, the theme is announced as the headline at the beginning of the
opening statement. For example, counsel might begin her opening statement in
Sargent v. Southern Accident Co. (above, page 28) with the assertion: “This is a story
about a heartless insurance company that chose to prolong the agony of grieving
parents by refusing to pay the amount due under the policy for which they had paid
until they proved the obvious – that their son is dead.”
Sometimes a theme may be expressed in a sentence or phrase that is used repeat-
edly for emphasis. For example, in Simpson one of the prosecutors challenged OJS
to put on the bloody glove that had allegedly been worn by the murderer and found
behind his house. It did not ﬁt. Throughout his closing, defense counsel sounded
the theme, “If it doesn’t ﬁt, you must acquit,” every time he identiﬁed items of the
prosecution’s evidence that could plausibly be interpreted as not supporting OJS’s
guilt.
The same barrister described the relationship between analysis and the develop-
ment of theory and theme and emphasized their importance as follows:
A primary task in any litigation is to develop a cohesive theory and theme of the case.
The theory should be that explanation of the facts which shows logic requires your side
to win and the theme should be that explanation of the facts which shows the moral
force is on your side. This strategy should provide a framework for assimilating the
facts in a manner which is most advantageous to your client. Since there are generally
some harmful facts in any litigation, you should choose a strategy which does not rely
on these facts and which makes such facts irrelevant . . .

effective litigation. Without a coherent framework provided by a carefully considered
strategy, the most exhaustive preparation, the most cogent argument, and the most
sympathetic case will be unavailing. While a cohesive theory cannot take the place of

thorough preparation and a favorable set of facts, it is the glue which holds together
the other elements required for successful litigation.8
The selection of the best theory of the case and its conversion into a compelling
narrative account, however, require more than logical analysis from the standpoints
of the proponent and opponent. It requires an understanding of the human and
physical material available as witnesses and other autoptic proferences and of the
signiﬁcant generalizations likely to inﬂuence a jury in a case of this kind. These are
the materials by which the story of the case as a whole must be presented and from
which the necessary themes can be established.
A story is a narrative account of a succession of events, ordinarily presented in
the chronological order in which they occurred, presented as a meaningful whole.9
Three elements are essential to the usage adopted here – a story is a narration of
events arranged in a time sequence; the narrated events are abstracted from their
disposition in the evidence presented at trial; and they are presented as a meaningful
totality.
In this usage, the “story of a case” would be the advocate’s narration of events
abstracted from the evidence and arranged in a sequence to persuade the fact-ﬁnder
that the story told is the most plausible account of what “really happened” that can
be constructed from the evidence that has been or will be presented. In advocacy,
the story must not include elements that are logically inconsistent with the theory of
the case and must be a plausible account, the main elements of which ﬁnd support
in the evidence.
It should be clear that construction of stories from the available evidential data
may be useful at any stage of the analysis. The master chronology and the narrative
are independently useful analytic devices. Both can reveal gaps in the evidence at a
time when further investigation or discovery might enable the advocate to ﬁll them
before trial. More, however, is required of a story in the context of a trial. It must
be a story the fact-ﬁnder, judge, or jury will ﬁnd compelling. Typically the story is
ﬁrst told as part of the opening statement, and is retold and urged as the only or
most probable account in closing argument.
Situation: We shall use the term “situation” where what is being described or
depicted is a state of affairs at a given moment of time as contrasted with a sequence
of events. A description of a situation is like a still photograph; a story is like a
moving picture. Both may be included in a narrative account. In this connection,
we have deliberately avoided using “scene,” because it tends to be used ambiguously
in lawyers’ talk. A “scene” may refer to a place (as in “the scene of the crime”) or to an

9 Two deﬁnitions offered by literary theorists are useful in the present context. In one view, a story
is a narrative of particular events arranged in a time sequence and forming a meaningful totality.
Adapted from P. Ricoeur (1981) 278–79. In another, the notion of story is limited to “the narrated
events, abstracted from their disposition in the text and reconstructed in their chronological order,
together with the participants in the event[s].” S. Rimmon-Kenan (1983) 3. See Rethinking, Ch. 7,
“Lawyers’ Stories” (for a fuller discussion of the role of story in advocacy and adjudication).

episode or part of a story (as in a scene in a play) or to a static situation (as in “he set
the scene before outlining the plot”). Although when used with precision “scene”
is often a useful term, loose usage glosses over distinctions that are important for
purposes of analysis.
In using situation sense, the advocate or judge categorizes the facts of the present
case as a type of situation and describes it at a level of generality and using language
that makes it ﬁt some recognizable general rule or principle that will justify the
desired outcome in this case.10 Consider, for example, the persuasive force of this
famous passage from a judgment of Lord Denning:
Did the accountants owe a duty of care to the plaintiff? . . . They were professional
accountants who prepared and put before him these accounts, knowing that he was
going to be guided by them in making an investment in the company. On the faith of
these accounts he did make the investment whereas if the accounts had been carefully
prepared, he would not have made the investment at all. The result is that he has lost
his money.11
Similarly, an advocate, in presenting her client’s story in a case involving disputed
issues of fact, might seek to characterize it as creating a situation in which the theory
and themes come together in a pattern that compels the result sought. For example,
an advocate might characterize the situation as one involving a professional advising
a non-professional and that professional expecting the advice to be relied upon.
The relationship between constructing theories, telling stories, and describing
situations, on the one hand, and constructing and analyzing arguments about evi-
dence, on the other, raises an important issue concerning the relationship between
story telling and atomistic analysis. Many trial lawyers and decision theorists believe
that juries (and other fact-ﬁnders) make “holistic” judgments – that they are per-
suaded by stories. In this view, juries choose between the two stories presented
by the contending lawyers (or adopt a variant of their own) and decide the case
accordingly. We largely agree with this view.12
In our view atomistic analysis is fundamental to story construction in the adver-
sarial system because:
In principle, the adversarial system is designed to assure generally sound processing of
information and resolution of questions of fact because it assigns primary responsibil-
ity for atomistic analysis and evaluation to the contending lawyers and appropriately
restricts the amount of information and the manner of its presentation to the ultimate
decision maker, be it judge or jury.13
10 Situation in this usage is often similar to Karl Llewellyn’s notion of “situation sense,” which he
developed in the context of appellate arguments about disputed questions of law. K. Llewellyn
(1960) 121–32, 268–74 . Note that “situation” in this context is not necessarily conﬁned to static
states of affairs.
