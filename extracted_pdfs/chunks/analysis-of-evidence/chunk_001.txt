Analysis of Evidence
This is an enjoyable and rigorous introduction to the construction and criticism
of arguments about questions of fact, and to the marshalling and evaluation of
evidence at all stages of litigation. It covers the principles underlying the logic of
proof; the uses and dangers of story-telling; standards for decision and the rela-
tionship between probabilities and proof; the chart method and other methods of
analyzing and ordering evidence in fact-investigation, in preparing for trial, and in
connection with other important decisions in legal processes and in criminal inves-
tigation and intelligence analysis. Most of the chapters in this new edition have been
rewritten; the treatment of fact investigation, probabilities and narrative has been
extended; and new examples and exercises have been added. Designed as a ﬂexible
tool for undergraduate and postgraduate courses on evidence and proof, students,
practitioners and teachers alike will ﬁnd this book challenging but rewarding.

Law in Context
The series is a vehicle for the publication of innovative scholarly books that treat law and
legal phenomena critically in their social, political and economic contexts from a variety of
perspectives. The series particularly aims to publish scholarly legal writings that bring fresh
perspectives to bear on new and existing areas of law taught in universities. A contextual
approachinvolvestreatinglegalsubjectsbroadly,usingmaterialsfromothersocialsciences,
and from any other discipline that helps to explain the operation in practice of the subject
under discussion. It is hoped that this orientation is at once more stimulating and more
realistic than the bare exposition of legal rules. The series includes original books that
have a different emphasis from traditional legal textbooks, while maintaining the same
high standards of scholarship. They are written primarily for students of law and of other
disciplines, but most also appeal to a wider readership. Recent publications include books
on globalization, transnational legal processes, and comparative law. In the past, most
authors have come from, or been based in, Europe or the Commonwealth. In the future,
wealsoexpecttopublishauthorsfrom,orbasedin,theUnitedStatesorCanada,particularly
those who adopt a clear transatlantic perspective. The books will include subject areas
that have a transnational signiﬁcance, drawing on European as well as North American
scholarship.

Preface
The why, what, and how of this book
The why
Inferential reasoning, analyzing and weighing evidence, forming judgments about
what has happened in the past or what is likely to happen in the future are a
necessary part of coping with the problems of everyday living. They are basic human
skills that form part of ordinary practical reasoning. Historians, detectives, doctors,
engineers, and intelligence analysts have to develop and apply these skills with rigor
and precision in specialized professional contexts. So do lawyers.
These skills have not traditionally formed part of professional training. Perhaps
this is because they are perceived to be “mere common sense”; or because it has been
felt that they can only be learned by practical experience “on the job”; or because
of a belief that these are matters of “intuition” or that great lawyers or historians or
detectives or diagnosticians are “born and not made.”1
This book starts from a different premise. Building on the work of the American
legal scholar John Henry Wigmore (1863–1943), we believe that skills in analyzing
and marshaling evidence and in constructing, criticizing and evaluating arguments
about disputed questions of fact are intellectual skills that can and should be taught
effectivelyandefﬁcientlyinlawschools.Theyareasessentialapartof“legalmethod”
as legal analysis and reasoning about questions of law. Common sense, intuition,
and practical experience all have a part to play in exercising these skills, but they are
not adequate substitutes for a systematic grounding in what Wigmore called “the
principles of proof.” This book is designed to enable students to lay a foundation
and to develop the basic skills to a high degree before they enter practice as lawyers
or in other spheres of activity that involve practical reasoning.
Between us we have accumulated more than ﬁfty years of experience in teaching
analysis of evidence in a variety of courses in several different countries. This book
builds on that experience. It is designed as a ﬂexible tool to lay a foundation for
mastering a necessary set of basic intellectual and professional skills in fact anal-
ysis. They include techniques for structuring a problem and organizing a mass of
data (macroscopic analysis) and techniques for detailed analysis and evaluation of

Preface
particular data and phases of complex arguments (microscopic analysis). Our main
purpose is to present a vehicle for learning certain usable basic skills of analysis,
argument, and practical problem-solving. The primary audience is law students,
especially in courses on evidence and trial practice, but the early chapters and many
of the examples can be used to learn about and develop skills of inferential reasoning
in other contexts.
The what
Chapter 1, “Evidence and inference: some food for thought,” is a series of materials,
cases, questions, and exercises. These are designed to achieve three objectives. First,
to engage the interest of students and other readers, we have included some familiar
and not so familiar examples illustrating the range of contexts in which inferential
reasoning is necessary or useful. Second, we have provided examples that introduce
concepts and issues that are developed in the remainder of the book so that readers
can actively think about them from the outset. Third, these materials include con-
crete examples and exercises that are used as the basis for explaining and illustrating
materials presented in later chapters. We have deliberately presented a wide variety
of materials so that teachers can select which examples to use to introduce the sub-
ject and which can be studied later or omitted altogether. All of these examples have
been used in the classroom, none of the authors use them all in one course, and
each has his favorites. This is not a reading chapter; rather the idea is to encourage
readers to engage actively with some concrete examples before moving on to the
more abstract material that follows. Some teachers have used selected examples
to illustrate concepts in subsequent chapters that students have been assigned to
read later. Others may choose to recommend that their students begin by reading
Chapters 2 and 3, referring back to particular examples as they appear in the text.
Chapter 2, “Fact investigation and the nature of evidence,” introduces basic
concepts and considerations that apply to evidence and inference across many
contexts, with particular reference to the generation and testing of hypotheses in the
process of any kind of factual investigation. This is illustrated vividly by the problem
of “connecting the dots” in intelligence analysis. It deals speciﬁcally with the idea of
“a substance-blind approach,” which considers the basic inferential characteristics
orcredentialsofevidence(relevance,credibility,andprobativeforce)withoutregard
to the substance or content of the evidence or to the context of the inquiry. This
classiﬁcation of evidence allows us to say general things about evidence regardless
of its substance.
Chapter 3, “Principles of proof,” develops these ideas in a legal context. It
describes the “Rationalist Tradition” that has been the foundation of Anglo-
American evidence scholarship and explains why it is relevant to contemporary
legal practice. It identiﬁes the forms of logic that must be used in analyzing evidence
or in justifying conclusions based upon evidence and demonstrates how they can
be applied to legal disputes, using the ﬁnal exercise in Chapter 1, “An investigation.”

Chapter 4, “Methods of analysis,” introduces the main methods of analysis used
in preparation for trial and their relations to each other: chronologies, the outline
method, narrative, and the chart method. It presents a general seven-step protocol
that ﬁts all of them, using the material from the O. J. Simpson case from Chapter 1
to illustrate its application. We have included this generalized account as a separate
chapter for two reasons: ﬁrst, some teachers may wish to provide an overview
of approaches without going into detail about the chart method. Second, in our
experience we have found this an effective way of easing students into the rigors of
the chart method.
Chapter 5, “The chart method,” is the heart of the book for those who wish to
master the most rigorous method of analysis. It is a substantially revised version of
the method that Wigmore developed for the analysis of mixed masses of evidence
early in the last century. It is an intellectual procedure for analyzing and organizing
a complex body of evidential data and demonstrating precisely how the inferences
from that data can be marshaled in support of and in opposition to the ultimate
proposition that must be proved. It also makes it possible to subject selected phases
of a complex argument to rigorous microscopic analysis. Such analysis can be used
to identify and construct arguments about whether evidence should be admitted or
its use restricted, as well as to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the particular
phase of the argument based upon that data. Each step of the method is illustrated
using United States v. Able and the O. J. Simpson example from Chapter 1.
Chapter 6, “Outline, chronologies, and narratives,” considers other methods
of analysis in the context of litigation. The outline method is a familiar device.
Variations of it are common. It is, on its face, less difﬁcult to grasp and easier to use
than the chart method. Chronologies and narratives are other devices commonly
usedinpracticetoorganizetheavailableevidenceandtodevelopandtestarguments
based on that evidence. Part C of that chapter, “The litigation context,” describes
which of the methods is best suited to the various stages of a case.
Chapter 7 uses an edited version of the record of R. v. Bywaters and Thompson
to illustrate how the chart method can be applied to a complex decided case. The
questions at the end have been organized to reﬂect the seven-step protocol. In
our experience, if students immerse themselves in the detail and then are guided
through the case using these questions step by step they readily grasp the basics
of Wigmorean analysis. However, other cases involving mixed masses of evidence
about which there is scope for reasoned disagreement, such as Sacco and Vanzetti,
or O. J. Simpson, or the Lindbergh Baby (Bruno Hauptman), or any other complex
case, can also be used for this purpose, provided that a detailed record is available
and there is a historical doubt about the event.
Wigmore’s presentation of the principles of reasoning and methods of analysis
falls squarely within the mainstream of Anglo-American scholarship, but he did not
satisfactorilyaddressaclassofproblemsthatareimportantforlawyersandthathave
emerged in recent debates as central issues for scholars. How is the strength of an
inference to be determined? How is the net persuasive value of a mass of evidence

whether a mass of evidence, which logically supports the truth of the proposition
ultimately to be proved, satisﬁes the applicable standard of proof? What do we mean
when we say a proposition has been proven to be “more probable than not,” proven
by “clear and convincing evidence,” or proven “beyond a reasonable doubt”? We
confront these problems in Chapters 8 and 9.
Chapter 8, “Evaluating evidence,” ﬁrst presents the traditional vocabularies that
lawyers and others use in arguing about these issues in court. The next part,
“Standards for decision,” introduces the distinction between standards intended
to guide the decision-makers’ exercise of discretion, such as the standards deﬁn-
ing the burden of proof, and standards designed to deﬁne the limits of discretion,
such as the standards that appellate courts apply in deciding whether the decision
below exceeded those limits. That part moves beyond the familiar standards of
proof to consider standards for other decisions that are involved in the total process
of litigation from the ﬁrst interview of a client to pre-trial decisions, through the
trial process and beyond, including standards for lawyers’ decisions, decisions to
prosecute, and other standards for decision in litigation and adjudication.
Chapter9,“Probabilities,weight,andprobativeforce,”providesabasicintroduc-
tion to probability theory. It outlines the debates about the application of different
theories of probability in legal contexts and elucidates some basic concepts. These
debates mainly focus upon whether probability theory should be used in evaluating
evidence for cases-as-a-whole – i.e. arguments to a judge or jury. As a practical
matter, practitioners, judges, and most legal academics have rejected the use of
Bayes’s Theorem and other axioms of probability for these purposes, but have rec-
ognized that they should play a role in speciﬁc contexts – for example, in paternity
suits, or disparate impact cases, as the basis for many scientiﬁc or expert opinions,
or in wrongful death or total disability cases. There are further reasons why lawyers
should be familiar with these concepts. Probability assessments have an important
role as an aid to making many pre-trial decisions. The decision to prosecute or
to contest a case requires analysis of the probability that liability or guilt will be
established and, in a civil case, an estimate of the probable quantum of damages.
Negotiations to settle a case or to reach a plea agreement are often argued in terms
of probability assessments made by each of the parties.2 Lawyers also need to be
equipped to recognize fallacies and misuses of statistics that may be made by their
opponents.
Chapter 9 provides the theoretical background to the separate appendix on
Probabilities and Proof by Philip Dawid, which is included on the website for this
book.3 Theappendixisabasicpracticalintroductiontostatisticalmethodappliedto

legal examples. It explores the theoretical and practical problems posed by the use of
mathematical probabilities in evaluating evidence. It introduces some basic axioms
of probabilistic analysis and, through a series of problems and exercises, illustrates
their application in contexts such as DNA, paternity suits, discrimination cases, and
actuarial analysis.
Chapter 10, “Necessary but dangerous,” explores at greater length the roles of
generalizations and stories in argumentation about questions of fact and the rela-
tions between them. This is mainly a theoretical chapter, but it includes two simple
protocols that a lawyer might use in testing key generalizations or potential stories
in preparing for trial.
Chapter 11, “The principles of proof and the law of evidence,” explores the
intimate relationship between the principles of proof and the law of evidence,
recapping on points where the connections have been touched on previously, espe-
cially in relation to basic concepts and exploring these in more detail in relation to
hearsay.
Chapter 12, “The trial lawyer’s standpoint,” integrates the materials and methods
introduced in Chapters 2 to 11 into the practical context of preparation for trial.
This chapter includes two simple trafﬁc cases that have been adapted from exercises
used at the Inns of Court School of Law in London and two more complex problems
drawn from the oldest National Trial Competition in the United States. We have
found that these cases work well either as a basis for class discussion or as problems
for simulated mini-trials on either side of the Atlantic.
Changes in this edition
First, David Schum has joined us as a co-author. Trained in probability and psy-
chology, he has in recent years been concerned with evidence as a multi-disciplinary
subject. In Evidential Foundations of Probabilistic Reasoning (1994) he argued that
other disciplines had a lot to learn about evidence from law, but that lawyers could
also beneﬁt by considering those features of evidence that cross all or most dis-
ciplines. This “substance-blind” approach to relevance, credibility, and probative
force is introduced in Chapter 2, with particular reference to investigation and
inquiry in both legal and non-legal contexts.
Second, scientiﬁc evidence, such as DNA, and the bearing of probability theory
and practical statistics on evidence in legal contexts have increased in importance
in recent years. Chapter 9 contains a brief introduction to probability theory; the
Appendix provides a practical introduction to the application of statistical methods
to legal issues as an optional extra. Placing this on the website has made it possible
to shorten the hard copy of the book, while substantially expanding the treatment
of statistics.
Third, Wigmorean analysis has become much better known outside legal circles
as well as within law. Specialists in decision theory, artiﬁcial intelligence, and in
other areas have taken great interest in assisting intelligence analysts in “connecting

Preface
the dots” or trying to make sense out of masses of evidence. Wigmore’s methods
are now being routinely applied in such efforts. They have also been applied to
investigation of multiple crimes and insurance fraud (Schum (1987), Leary (2003),
Twining (2003)). We have expanded the scope of this edition to take account of
such developments, especially in relation to intelligence analysis post 9/11.
Fourth, there have been many developments in the law of evidence, civil and
criminal procedure, and in scientiﬁc evidence.4 Evidence scholarship has continued
to be a lively and pluralistic ﬁeld. It is now a well-established area in comparative
law. Evidence is becoming increasingly recognized as an exciting multidisciplinary
subject of great importance in many spheres of practical activity (Schum (1994);
Twining and Hampsher-Monk (2003); Twining (2003)). The ﬁrst edition did not
deal in detail with how the principles of proof and the law of evidence interact. We
have added Chapter 11 in order to make this relationship clear and to facilitate the
integration of the logic of proof and the rules of evidence in teaching.5
All of these developments have been taken into account in revising this edition.
However, the principles of inferential reasoning, the basic concepts, and the skills
involved in analyzing and marshaling mixed masses of evidence are quite stable. We
have retained examples that we have found work well in teaching, even though some
of them are quite old. We have dropped others and streamlined the presentation.
We have tried to make the book more ﬂexible and accessible to a variety of users,
by giving clearer signposts.
Throughout this period the authors have continued to think, write, and teach
in this area. Our ideas have continued to develop and we have learned from the
experience of using the ﬁrst edition in teaching and from the critical feedback of
hundreds of students and some colleagues. Almost all our students have found
the process of learning the method challenging and hard work (the motto of our
courses has been “tough, but fun”); nevertheless, the vast majority have succeeded
in mastering the basic techniques and many have produced work of outstanding
quality. Interestingly, the subject has worked best with ﬁrst year law students in
Miami, where it is a popular elective in the second semester. Many of our students
have reported that they have found the approach very helpful in practice, some
claimingthatitwasthemostusefulcoursethattheyhadinlawschool.Ofcourse,they
4 For England these developments are surveyed in Zander (2003), Dennis (2004), and Roberts and
Zuckerman (2004).
5 Throughout this edition we indicate important points of contact between the principles of proof
and the law of evidence. For this purpose, we have used the Federal Rules of Evidence (as amended
up to Dec. 1, 2002). This is a coherent, accessible, and important code that falls four-square within
the Rationalist Tradition. In respect of English law we make regular reference to Ian Dennis, The
Law of Evidence (2nd edn, 2002), especially Chs. 1–4, which is generally in tune with our approach.
So is Roberts and Zuckerman, Criminal Evidence (2004). Michael Zander’s Cases and Materials
on the English Legal System (9th edn, 2003) contains useful discussions of debates and reforms
concerning evidence and procedure in recent years. The main points of direct connection between
the principles of proof and the law of evidence concern matters such as the basic concepts, relevance,
standards of proof, and judicial notice, topics in respect of which there are not great differences
between common law jurisdictions.

do not spend time drawing elaborate charts in straightforward cases, but the basic
techniques of evidence marshaling and argument construction can become habits
of mind that are invaluable and efﬁcient in handling both simple and complex cases.
This is hardly surprising because Wigmore’s method is essentially a systematization
of the “best practice” of good lawyers.
Most of our students and some colleagues are converts. Moreover, the type of
analysis involved in the chart method has in recent years attracted interest in a
number of ﬁelds, including police investigation, intelligence analysis, and various
other spheres of practical decision-making (Schum (1987); Leary (2003), Twining
(2003)). There are, however, still some skeptics, not least among teachers of the
law of evidence (Roberts (2002), Murphy (2001); response by Twining (2005)). We
have tried to address their central criticism that the ﬁrst edition was too substantial
and complex to use in an ordinary law of evidence course, and we hope that this
edition is more accessible and user friendly.
How to use this book
Our main purpose is to present a vehicle for learning certain usable basic skills of
analysis, argument, and practical problem-solving; hence this book can be used
as core or supplemental material in a variety of ways and in a variety of courses.
Chapter 1 contains a number of concrete examples and exercises that can be used
selectively for different purposes.
First, the book can be used as the basis for a self-standing course on analysis of
evidence.Allthreeauthorshaveuseditinthiswayforoveradecadeinapostgraduate
course in London, in ﬁrst degree courses for lawyers and non-lawyers at George
Mason University, and, most successfully, as a popular ﬁrst year elective at the
University of Miami Law School.
Second, this edition has been designed so that it can also be used as part of
orthodox evidence courses. Anderson has regularly used it during the ﬁrst three
weeks of a standard four-credit course on the Law of Evidence in Miami; Twining
teaches it as the ﬁrst third of the year-long course on Evidence and Proof in the
London LLM, the second half of which is devoted to selected topics in the Law of
Evidence, the remainder being devoted to a brief introduction to statistical analysis.
Other law teachers who have tried to introduce this approach at the start of their
courses on evidence have tended to ﬁnd the ﬁrst edition too substantial and too
dense to use in three to four weeks. With this in mind we have reorganized the book,
shortened several chapters, and indicated more clearly how the principles of proof
underpin and are integrated into evidence doctrine. We have also provided some
guidance to teachers who wish to take some short cuts in order to ﬁt this subject
into a few weeks.
We would emphasize, however, that there are no short cuts to learning
the basic skills involved. If the learning objectives include mastering the basic
techniques of evidence marshaling and the construction and criticism of rigorous

Preface
arguments about disputed questions of fact, these can only be acquired by repeated
practice involving exercises that are inevitably time consuming for students.
However, it is our experience that a student who has acquired these skills can
much more rapidly and efﬁciently understand the law of evidence and its practical
applications. In short, studying analysis of evidence takes time, but it also saves
time. In our view, the basic approach can be taught in a minimum of eight to ten
contact hours together with at least two written exercises.
Third, while the obvious and tested uses are in basic or advanced courses in
evidence and trial or pre-trial advocacy, we believe that some chapters can also
be usefully employed in any skills course that seeks to develop the intellectual
component of practical lawyering skills (and indeed in pre-law and other under-
graduate courses concerned with rigorous reasoning about disputed questions of
fact). Handling evidence is a basic human skill and a neglected aspect of “thinking
like a lawyer.” Wigmorean analysis is beginning to feature in the training of intel-
ligence analysts, police investigators, and others. It deserves to be a regular part of
the curriculum of ﬁrst degrees in law.
