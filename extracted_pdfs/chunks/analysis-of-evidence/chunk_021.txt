accused for possession with intent to distribute. The current rationale for the rule
is that exclusion is required to deter police misconduct.32
The application of the constitutional exclusionary rule has always required anal-
ysis of the evidence bearing upon the circumstances in which the challenged evi-
dence was obtained. The party opposing admission of evidence on the ground that
it was unlawfully seized must produce evidence of the circumstances surround-
ing the search and marshal the available inferences to demonstrate that it was
an “unreasonable search.” The Supreme Court has enhanced the need for careful
analysis of the facts (and has diluted the rule) by decisions such as those creat-
ing special rules authorizing the search of an automobile,33 and those establishing
an impeachment exception to the exclusionary rule authorizing the use of unlaw-
fully obtained evidence to impeach the credibility of an accused who takes the
stand.34
The other principal source of rules excluding probative evidence are the rules
establishing privileged communications. Information provided by an accused to
her lawyer about what happened is likely to be highly probative or likely to iden-
tify sources from which dispositive evidence of guilt might be obtained. So too,
statements an accused might make to his physician in order to enable her to treat
her gunshot wounds would almost certainly have probative value in determining
whether she was a participant or an innocent bystander in a bank robbery in which a
number of bank employees and customers had been shot. Society has decided rules
prohibiting the discovery or use of communications between lawyer and client, doc-
tor and patient, priest and penitent are necessary to achieve other important ends,
notwithstanding the limits they impose upon the gathering and use of probative
evidence.Theapplicationoftheserulesalsorequiresanalysisoftheunderlyingfacts.
Did the communication occur during the existence of the privileged relationship?
Did it fall within the scope of that relationship? And so on.
4. A Wigmorean protocol for analyzing problems in the use and
admissibility of evidence under the Federal Rules and its application
Figure 11.2 describes a seven-step protocol for analyzing problems in the use and
admissibility of evidence. That protocol can be used to illustrate the relationship
between analysis of evidence and the rules prescribed by law to regulate the admissi-
bility and use of evidence. The admissibility and use problems presented by hearsay
evidence are among the most interesting and complex problems addressed by the
Federal Rules. We begin with a description of the problems from an analytic per-
spective. We conclude with an application of the protocol to a concrete hearsay
problem.
32 The rationale originally had a second prong. Exclusion was necessary to protect the integrity of
the courts, that is the courts should not be dealing in stolen evidence. The original rationale and
its evolution through the Court’s decision are described in LaFave (2004) §3.1(b).
33 The origin and development of the automobile rules are described in LaFave (2004) §3.7.
34 Id. at § 9.6. For an analysis of the impeachment exception, see Kainen (1992).

Analysis of Evidence
1 What is the ultimate probandum for the case in which the proffered evidence is being
offered? What are the penultimate probanda?
2 To what fact of consequence is the proffered evidence relevant? Specify the necessary
inferential steps.
3 Is there a rule of evidence that the opponent could invoke to challenge the
admissibility or use of the proffered evidence? If so, specify the rule, and make the
argument, initially in syllogistic form.
4 What, if any, are the arguments that the proponent of the evidence may make to avoid
the application or minimize the effect of the rule or rules? Begin by challenging the
opponent’s rule-based argument.
5 Unless it is clear (and it rarely is) that the evidence must be excluded under the rule or
rules invoked, what is the legitimate probative value of the proffered evidence? What
are its improper prejudicial effects?
6 What is the strongest argument that can be made to persuade the court that the
improper prejudicial effects (“PE”) substantially outweigh (or outweigh) the
legitimate probative value (“PV”)? That is that PE ≫PV? What is the strongest
argument the proponent could make to diminish the PE and enhance the PV in order
to persuade the court that the PE do not substantially outweigh the PV?
7 Should the proffered evidence be admitted? If admitted should its use be limited? Why?

a. The hearsay problem35
A rule preferring live testimony rather than hearsay ﬁnds strong support in the
logical principles of proof. In any case in which a statement made by a declarant,
otherwise than while testifying, is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted,
the number of steps in the inferential chain increases and the sources of possible
error multiply. Consider, for example, the testimony of William in a case in which
Sam is accused of murdering John: “I heard Donald say, ‘I saw Sam shoot John.”
In determining whether Donald said, “I saw Sam shoot John,” the decision-maker
must consider William’s credibility and the factors that might affect his veracity,
his objectivity, and his observational sensitivity. In doing so, they must answer four
questions creating at least four possible sources of error. Did William believe he
had heard Sam’s statement at the time at which William testiﬁed? Did William have
any expectations that might have caused him to misinterpret Donald’s statement?
(For example, Donald may have already suspected that it was Sam who murdered
John and, for that reason, he may have thought he heard “Sam” when in fact
Donald actually said, “I saw Pam shoot John.”) Given the lapse of time, did William
accurately remember what he heard John say? Was William’s hearing good and was
he close enough to hear what John said? Figure 11.3 depicts an investigative key-list
35 This section is based upon the more comprehensive account and analysis of the hearsay problem
developed in Schum (1992).

Analysis of Evidence
and chart that an attorney might use to guide her search for evidence upon which
to base her cross-examination of William.
The central distinction between live testimony and hearsay is the availability
of the right to cross-examine the live witness.36 The attorney for Sam can cross-
examine William to ensure that the jury is aware of any factors that might call into
questionWilliam’sveracity,objectivity,orobservationalsensitivity.Shecouldcross-
examine William to eliminate any ambiguities that might be created by his other
testimonial assertions. There is no ambiguity in William’s testimony reporting what
John said and, assuming counsel’s cross-examination did not develop reasons to
question William’s credibility, a jury might infer, but could only infer, that Donald
said, “I saw Sam shoot John.”
Donald’s statement, if admissible, would clearly be offered to prove the truth of
the matter asserted. From the statement the jury would be asked to infer that (a)
Donald saw Sam shoot John and from that inference that (b) Sam shot John and
from that inference, combined with inferences from evidence concerning the cause
of John’s death, that (c) it was Sam who committed the act that caused John’s death.
The logical foundation for a rule excluding hearsay or limiting its use stems
from the fact that the jury will not hear Donald say, “I saw Sam shoot John,” and
Sam’s attorney cannot cross-examine John to ensure that the jury is aware of any
factors that may call into question his credibility attributes that might raise doubts
about his veracity, the objective accuracy of his statement, or his observational
sensitivity.37 Any or all of these factors might have diminished Donald’s credibility,
but the jury must assess his credibility without knowing whether or which of these
factors existed. The sources of doubt about the truth and accuracy of William’s
testimony must be multiplied by the sources of doubt about the truth and accuracy
of Donald’s assertion, sources about which the jury lacks information necessary to
appraise their signiﬁcance. That is the logical problem created by the admission of
hearsay.Analysisoftheevidenceisnecessarytodemonstratethatthenumberofsteps
in the inferential chain necessary to establish relevance diminished the probative
value of the statement and how the inability to present factors that might affect the
jury’s appraisal of the declarant’s credibility creates, at a minimum, a substantial
prejudicial effect that is improper by dramatically increasing the likelihood that the
jury will overvalue or be misled by the assertion.38
Most deﬁned exceptions to the hearsay rule are also grounded in logic. These
exceptions are based upon the view that it is possible to identify circumstances
in which some statements are made that provide intrinsic indicia of reliability
36 Another distinction that is important is that the decision-maker is able to observe the demeanor
and reactions of the witness while she is being examined.
37 Rule806wasadoptedtodiminishthesesourcesofdoubtbypermittingtheopponentoftheevidence
to introduce some extrinsic evidence to attack the credibility of a declarant whose assertion has
been admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule.
38 The United States Supreme Court has decided that the Confrontation Clause, U.S. Const., amend.
VI, prohibits the admission of hearsay testimonial assertions such as William’s report of what John
said, Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).

sufﬁcient to justify their admission, notwithstanding the absence of the declarant.
These exceptions also reﬂect a policy that not only the indicia of reliability, but
also the necessity that the statement be admitted, are to be considered. As the need
increases, the indicia of reliability required are often reduced. For example, the need
for the admission of a dead declarant’s dying declaration concerning the cause of
her death is usually high. Unless someone else was present, there may be no other
evidence. The declarant is unavailable, and the statement, if true, has substantial
probative value. The indicia of reliability, however, are weak. The only apparent
indicia are based upon one or both of two generalizations:
1 People who fear God are unlikely to lie when they believe death is imminent.
2 The imminence of death concentrates the mind and diminishes the capacity to
fabricate.
Neither of these generalizations has been empirically justiﬁed, and both can be
rebutted by a counter-generalization:
3 A person who believes that death is imminent also believes that this is her last chance
to get even or bring down a person she hates.39
A similar analysis could be made of each of the other exceptions under Federal
Rules 803 (Availability of Declarant immaterial) and 804 (Declarant unavailable)
other than the exception for former testimony codiﬁed in Rule 804(b)(1) (where
admissibility is justiﬁed based upon indicia of accuracy and considerations of fair-
ness in light of necessity).
Exercise
Figure 11.4 is a graph on which the need for the admission of hearsay statements
and the intrinsic indicia of reliability can be plotted. The authors have depicted
their view of the need and indicia of reliability for two of the exceptions – Rules 806
(business records) and 804(b)(2) (dying declarations). Review the other exceptions
created by Rules 803 and 804, and use the graph to depict your view of need and
indicia of reliability that might be used to justify the exception.
b. The protocol applied
In United States v. Able (pages 23–28), the government gave Able’s counsel a three-
page memorandum prepared by FBI Agent Dawes stating that he had interviewed
Timothy Cooper in August 2004 and that, among other things, Cooper had told him
that Cooper had merged his accounting practice in July 2004 and that his secretary
had lost or thrown out some materials, such as notes and work papers, contained in
inactive client-ﬁles. According to the memorandum, Cooper told Dawes that Able
39 Even if Mrs. Shepard had believed that death was imminent, she may have stated that Dr. Shepard
had poisoned her in order to bring down her faithless husband so that he would not be able to
marry the mistress with whom he had tormented her. See Shepard v. United States, 290 U.S. 96
(1933), for a full account of her statements and the context in which they were made.

was listed as an inactive client at the time. Dawes’s memorandum reported that
Cooper could not tell from examining the ﬁle whether any materials from Able’s
ﬁle had been discarded.
Dawes’s memorandum also reported that Cooper had no recollection of how the
signing of Able’s return was handled, but Cooper said that he usually mailed two
copies of a return to his clients with an envelope addressed to the Internal Revenue
Service and a note instructing them to review, sign, and mail the completed returns
by April 15. The memorandum reports that Cooper could not ﬁnd a copy of such
a note with the copy of Able’s 2003 return in his ﬁles. Cooper reported that the
ﬁle contains no information about any income other than Able’s salary, and that
Cooper did not recall Able informing him that he had received any other income.
The problem included the following additional facts:
On cross-examination, Cooper testiﬁed that he did not recall seeing Able’s April 11
letter; that had his ofﬁce received it, it would have been in the client-ﬁle he maintained
for Able, and it is not; that his ﬁles were perfectly maintained; that he does not recall
discussing any papers being lost in his 2004 move; and that he has never seen Agent
Dawes’s memorandum and it does not refresh his recollection.

311
Are Agent Dawes’s memorandum and the statement it reports that Cooper made
admissible?
How the protocol set out in Figure 11.2 could be used to develop an answer to
this question is illustrated below.
1 What is the ultimate probandum for the case in which the proffered evidence is
being offered? What are the penultimate probanda?
The ultimate and penultimate probanda in Able were formulated in Chapter 5 (at
page 126). The ultimate probandum was:
1 Richard Able (“RA”) knowingly ﬁled a false federal tax return for the year 2003
(“the 2003 return”) with intent to defraud the government of income tax due and
owing on not less than $45,000.
This was partitioned and repartitioned into seven penultimate probanda.
2 RA knowingly ﬁled a false income tax return for the year 2003.
3 RA ﬁled a tax return for the year 2003.
4 The tax return that RA ﬁled for 2003 was false.
5 RA knew his 2003 tax return was false when he ﬁled it.
6 At the time RA ﬁled his 2003 tax return, he intended to defraud the government of
income tax due and owing on not less than $45,000.
7 RA owed the government taxes on an additional $45,000 at the time he ﬁled his
2003 tax return.
8 RA intended to defraud the government of the taxes due and owing at the time he
ﬁled his 2003 tax return.
2 To what fact of consequence is the proffered evidence relevant? Specify the
necessary inferential steps.
a Cooper’s statements that papers were lost from his inactive client ﬁles when he
moved his ofﬁce and that Able was an inactive client at that time are relevant to
two facts of consequence. First, these statements support an inference that the
April 11 letter might have been lost during the move. That inference supports an
opponent’s explanation that accounts for the fact the letter was not in Cooper’s ﬁle
at the time the FBI approached him. That explanatory proposition is relevant
because it makes the inference that Able’s letter was not delivered to Cooper’s
ofﬁce, an inference that was supported by evidence that the letter was not in
the ﬁle and by Cooper’s assertion that his ﬁles had been perfectly maintained.
For that reason, the explanatory proposition increases the probability that Able’s
letter was delivered to Cooper’s ofﬁce, which in turn makes it more probable that
Able intended to disclose and intended that Cooper include the additional
$45,000 in his tax return and thus makes it less probable that: “2. RA knowingly
ﬁled a false income tax return for the year 2003,” or that: “8. RA intended to
defraud the government of the taxes due and owing at the time he ﬁled his
2003 tax return,” two of the penultimate probanda the government must
prove.
Second, the statements are also relevant to Cooper’s credibility because they are
prior statements that are inconsistent with the testimony he gave on the witness
stand. Since both statements cannot be true, the probability that his testimonial

Analysis of Evidence
assertions are true is diminished. Since the credibility of a witness who has testiﬁed
is also a fact of consequence, both statements are relevant.
b The Dawes memorandum. The assertions made in Dawes’s memorandum are
relevant to show that Cooper in fact made the statements which the memorandum
reported he had made. Because Cooper’s statements are relevant to three facts of
consequence, evidence that he made those statements is also relevant to those facts
of consequence.
3 Is there a rule of evidence that the opponent could invoke to challenge the
admissibility or use of the proffered evidence? If so, specify the rule, and make the
argument, initially in syllogistic form.
Both statements ﬁt squarely into the deﬁnition of hearsay.
a Cooper. Under Rule 801(a) a statement that is an oral assertion made by a
declarant other than while testifying that is offered to prove the truth of the matter
asserted is hearsay. Here Cooper is a declarant who made two assertions to Agent
Dawes during an interview, each of which is being offered to prove the truth of the
matter asserted, i.e., that papers from Cooper’s inactive client ﬁles were lost during
a move in 2003 and that Able was an inactive client at that time. Both statements
are hearsay and hearsay is not admissible under Rule 802.
b The Dawes memorandum. The two relevant written assertions made in the Dawes
memorandum (identiﬁed above) are only relevant if they are offered to prove the
truth of the matter asserted, namely that Cooper made the statements during the
interview that the memorandum reports that he did. Dawes is the declarant and
each of the written assertions that Dawes made prior to trial is being offered to
prove the truth of the matter asserted. Each is hearsay and Rule 802 prohibits their
admission.
4 What, if any, are the arguments that the proponent of the evidence may make to
avoid the application or minimize the effect of the rule or rules? Begin by
challenging the opponent’s rule-based argument.
Rule 802 does not prohibit the admission of any of the statements.
a Cooper: Rule 613(b) authorizes the admission of extrinsic evidence of a prior
inconsistent statement of a witness if the witness has been afforded an opportunity
to explain or deny the existence of the same. The Dawes memorandum is extrinsic
evidence that Cooper made the two prior inconsistent statements. Cooper was
confronted with and afforded an opportunity to deny or explain those statements
when he was cross-examined. The statements are offered to undermine Cooper’s
credibility, not to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and for that purpose, they
are not hearsay. They are relevant, and Rule 402 requires that they be admitted. If
the assertions made by Dawes in the memorandum are admissible then the
assertions attributed to Cooper are also admissible.
b The Dawes memorandum: The assertions made by Dawes in his memorandum
are not hearsay. Under Rule 801(d)(2)(D)(2), a statement offered against a party is
not hearsay if the statement was made by the party’s agent concerning a matter
within the scope of the agency made during the existence of the relationship. The
statement is being offered by the defendant against his party-opponent, the United
States.

At the time he interviewed Cooper, Dawes was an FBI agent employed by the
United States. Conducting and documenting interviews in a criminal investigation
is within the scope of an FBI agent’s employment. Dawes has testiﬁed that he wrote
the memorandum. Any statements made in that memorandum are excluded from
the deﬁnition of hearsay by Rule 801(d)(2)(D)(2).
Moreover, the statements made in the memorandum would in any event be
admissible under Rule 803(5) (recollection recorded). Assuming he followed FBI
procedures, Dawes will testify that he dictated the memorandum immediately after
the interview with Cooper and that he reviewed and corrected the draft no later
than the following day. The substance of the memorandum was made when it was
fresh in his memory and, given his training and the procedures he followed, there
is ample evidence to show that the memorandum reﬂects his knowledge correctly.
Thus the memorandum could in any event be read to the jury, and the jury could
consider the statements Dawes made as evidence of the truth of the matters he
asserted.
5 Unless it is clear (and it rarely is) that the evidence must be excluded under the rule
or rules invoked, what is the legitimate probative value of the proffered evidence?
What are its improper prejudicial effects?
The only legitimate probative value of the statements is the probative value of
Cooper’s inconsistent statements with respect to the credibility of the assertions he
made while testifying. The primary improper prejudicial effect stems from the fact
that the jury is likely to use these statements as evidence of the truth of the matter
asserted, notwithstanding any instructions the court may give telling them that they
are not to consider them for that purpose.
6 What is the strongest argument that can be made to persuade the court that the
improper prejudicial effects (“PE”) substantially outweigh the legitimate probative
value (“PV”)? That is that PE ≫PV? What is the strongest argument the proponent
could make to diminish the PE and enhance the PV in order to persuade the court
that the PE do not substantially outweigh the PV?
a The government. The jury is likely to consider the statements for the truth of the
matter asserted and infer that Able’s letter may have been one of the papers lost.
Apart from the fact that the rules prohibit consideration of Cooper’s assertions for
the truth of the matter they assert, the jury has no foundation upon which to
accurately appraise the value of these statements for three reasons. First, it is likely
that Cooper learned of the alleged loss from his secretary, in which event the jury is
basing its assessment of hearsay within hearsay within hearsay – and so extending
the inferential chain to its breaking point. Second, the support that these
statements provide for an inference that Able’s letter was one of the papers lost is
both weak and ambiguous. The jury will have no evidence indicating the extent of
the problem. If ﬁve pieces of paper were lost during a move of 5,000 ﬁles, the
likelihood that Able’s letter was among them is remote. If the boxes containing the
inactive client ﬁles fell off the truck and the papers in those ﬁles scattered with the
wind, the likelihood that Able’s letter was among the papers lost would be high.
But without any evidence to place the problem in context, it is almost certain the
jury will misvalue this evidence.

Analysis of Evidence
b Able. Cooper’s credibility is central. If the jurors accept his testimony about the
perfection with which he maintained his ﬁles, the likelihood that they will ﬁnd
Able guilty will increase dramatically. If they have evidence before them showing
that he either lied or has a seriously defective memory, they are likely to discredit
all his testimony and the likelihood they would ﬁnd Able guilty will decrease
accordingly. The probative value of this evidence is high. The government’s
cynicism about the ability and willingness of the jurors to follow the instructions
the court gives them is hardly ground for penalizing the defendant. There are no
irremediable improper prejudicial effects and certainly none that could
substantially outweigh the probative value of this evidence.
7 Should the proffered evidence be admitted? If admitted should its use be limited?
Why?
This could well be the ﬁrst question in the protocol. Most lay persons can make a
sound judgment about whether certain evidence should be admitted. Those trained
in analysis have a more developed “common sense” and basis for their “gut feelings.”
But most of the time, most of us would get it right even if we did not know the
intricacies of the rules of evidence and their application. In that context, the answer
here is easy: Yes, the evidence should be admitted.
That conclusion can easily be justiﬁed under the policy upon which the hearsay
rule and its exceptions were based. Given that the source of the information about
Cooper’s statement is an FBI agent, it is almost certain that Cooper made the
assertions attributed to him and that those statements were true. FBI agents do not
reach out to gather evidence that will make the prosecutor’s task more difﬁcult. If they
report evidence that favors the defense, it is almost certain their report is accurate or
understates the evidence. Cooper should not be permitted to lie with impunity and, if
his memory is that bad, the jury should have that information in deciding how much
reliance they may fairly place on any testimony he gives that implicates Able in the
alleged crime. Having made that assessment, defense counsel’s task is to ﬁgure out
how to get in under the rules and the prosecution’s task is to decide whether and how
strongly she wishes to oppose the admission of the evidence.
Exercise
Apply the protocol to determine whether proposition 6 in “An investigation” – “W3
says that he overheard X on Christmas Day say angrily to Y, ‘I shall not forget this’” –
could or should be admissible if X is tried for the murder of Y. Would the trial judge
have to consider the limitations imposed by Crawford v. Washington in resolving
that issue? Why or why not?

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
A. A Wigmorean lawyer prepares for trial
The purpose of this part of the chapter is twofold. First, we want to set Wigmorean
analysis in general and the chart method in particular in the context of trial prepa-
ration and practice in the United States.1 All competent lawyers use and apply the
principles of proof in preparing a case and all use one or more devices to consol-
idate the results of their analysis. The chart method is simply an additional and a
more methodical and rigorous device, one that requires making explicit what might
otherwise be left implicit. Second, we want to describe the processes and devices
lawyers commonly use to translate and reorganize the products of their analysis of
the law and facts into a form suitable for use at trial. We start by describing some
such devices and conclude with a brief discussion of ways in which the products of
analysis are translated into the tools of advocacy.
1. Of charts and other analytic devices
All phases of the trial lawyer’s work involve two fundamental and related processes:
analysis of law and analysis of fact. At all points from the initial interview onward,
the lawyer uses her existing legal knowledge to probe for facts that may be relevant
to the case at hand. These facts in turn suggest further inquiries: the potentially
applicable legal principles may be expanded, narrowed, or reﬁned by research and
analysis. The facts known and the products of the legal research and analysis may
suggest additional lines of factual inquiry. The process is reﬂexive and continuous.
The analytic component of this process continues through closing argument
(and beyond). The evidence is in and closed. Given this ﬁnite body of evidential
data and given the law the trier of fact will apply, how can the evidence be most
effectively organized and marshaled to support the inferences the lawyer advocates
that the trier should accept? In theory, however, the investigative process ends as the
trial begins. The lawyers for each of the parties have a common set of legal principles
to work with – in the jury trial context, the jury instructions. Each of the lawyers
1 We chose the United States for two reasons. First, jury trials are more common in the United States
than in England, especially in civil cases. Second, preparing for a jury trial calls upon all of the
analytic and other skills that this book seeks to develop.

has a deﬁned and relatively settled body of evidential data. There may be variables
to be resolved: Which of the contending legal principles will be adopted or applied?
Which of the evidential data will be admitted? Which excluded? But in theory, the
available chips are all on the table. And the theory comes close enough to reality to
make the model useful.2
Under this model, a lawyer trained in the chart method of analysis would have
identiﬁed the available evidential propositions; charted the possible inferential rela-
tionships; and prepared a set of strategic charts, each reﬂecting her judgments on
how to maximize the probability that her theory of the case will be accepted and to
minimize the risk that opposing counsel will achieve their objectives.3 Collectively,
the ﬁnal product would be designed to account for all the foreseeable variables.
If these legal principles are accepted, take this road; if that evidence is excluded,
fall back to this position and follow this alternative path. The extent to which real-
ity falls short of the theory merely increases the number of possible variables that
counsel must anticipate and for which she must plan. Although few lawyers fully
chart their cases, all use other devices to facilitate their analysis and organization of
the data. For example, most lawyers analyze and cross-reference the evidential data
each witness can supply. What precise testimonial assertions can this witness make?
To what allegations in the pleadings or to what fact required to be proved under
the jury instructions is each relevant? What other assertions or evidential data exist
to corroborate or discredit such allegations or facts? Are they or can they be made
admissible?
From this witness-by-witness and exhibit-by-exhibit analysis, every lawyer must
develop a composite which she can use to analyze the case as a whole. Where the
dispute involves past events, one of the most useful analytical tools is the master
chronology. Set every event described in the testimonial assertions and documents
in the sequence in which they are alleged to have occurred. Such a chronology makes
two objectives possible. It presents the events in the order in which they supposedly
occurred, the order in which most people think, and thus makes it possible to
construct stories that the evidence supports. It also makes it easier to identify gaps
and conﬂicts in the evidence. Similarly, in a criminal or personal injury suit, the
physical setting where the central events occurred is often critical, and most lawyers
will reconstruct the events through diagrams or models. Both kinds of composites
are nothing more than devices to ﬁx the alleged events in time and space and to
2 In theory, through meticulous investigation and use of discovery mechanisms, both lawyers should
have a ﬁrm idea of the data available for presentation. In fact, the theory can never be fully realized
and sometimes not even approached. Not all facts are ever discovered in civil cases, and legal as well
as practical limitations leave much to be learned during trial on the criminal side. (See discussion
below.)
3 Lawyers rarely use the chart method fully in practice because it requires too much time. Less rarely,
lawyers use the method to chart particular phases of an argument. Lawyers who have been trained
in the chart method, the most rigorous method of analysis, develop skills that are useful in any
method of analysis. Two of the authors have taught law students the chart method of analysis for
more than 20 years, the other for more than ﬁve years. Almost all students have enthusiastically
acknowledged the beneﬁts of the course.

make them concrete. Both are necessary tools for organization and analysis. Both
are common tools. Both are compatible with Wigmore’s general approach.4
The chart, as a method of analysis, does not replace other devices; it simply
provides an additional and rigorous method for analyzing facts and constructing
and testing arguments at any point in the process. The Wigmorean lawyer will
have his or her witness-by-witness proposition lists cross-referenced to each other
and to the pleadings and law; an exhibit-by-exhibit proposition list similarly cross-
referenced; and, where appropriate, a series of diagrams and other composites. One
point merits emphasis: All such devices require application of the principles of
proof.
As ﬁnal preparation for trial begins, every lawyer uses one or more of the com-
pilation devices: A master chronology, a model, a map; an index of the evidential
facts by legal principle and allegation in the pleadings; and so on. Such systems have
long been commonplace among competent trial lawyers. For example, Elihu Root is
reported to have developed a seven-document system in the late nineteenth century
that, with some adaptation, is similar to those in use today. Under the Root-Stimson
system, lawyers assisting in trial preparation were required to prepare seven docu-
ments: (1) a pleadings chart to identify, allegation by allegation, which facts alleged
in the pleadings had been admitted, denied, stipulated, etc., in order to identify
the material facts-in-issue for trial; (2) a master chronology organizing the facts in
chronological order and identifying the witnesses or documents by which each will
be proved; (3) an abstract of the documents to be used, arranged chronologically
or, where appropriate, by subject matter; (4) a preliminary analysis in outline form
that identiﬁed every proposition to be proved at trial and identiﬁed the witnesses
and documents by which each was to be proved; (5) the trial book developed from
these documents; (6) a memorandum of law for the court outlining counsel’s view
of the central facts in issue and controlling law to be applied; and (7) the proposed
jury instructions counsel will ask the court to give. Although developments, such
as the move to notice pleading, the expanded scope of discovery, and the intro-
duction of new technologies, require some modiﬁcation, the description of that
system makes it clear that the basic approaches are timeless. Then to apply the chart
method simply provides the Wigmorean lawyer with an additional device and skills
for rigorously ordering the available data and precisely analyzing their relationships
to the ultimate propositions to be proved.
2. The trial book: an organizational device
None of these devices, however, organizes the available data in a form suitable
for presentation at trial. The ﬁnal pre-trial step must be to reorganize the data
4 Complex cases may require additional or different devices. For example, many cases require expert
analysis and testimony. The data must be collected and organized to facilitate this analysis and
presentation for the speciﬁc case at hand. The point, however, should be clear: All competent
lawyers use appropriate devices to organize the facts at various stages in the preparation of a case
for trial.

Analysis of Evidence
in a manner that will facilitate its use at trial. The most common device used
for this is the lawyer’s “trial book.” The “trial book” is simply a lawyer’s device
for organizing what he or she needs to try a particular lawsuit. Typically, it will
include pleadings, checklists, copies of documents to be introduced and statements
or depositions to be used, outlines for opening and closing, outlines or anticipated
“scripts”fordirectandcross-examinationofwitnesses,juryinstructions,andmem-
oranda of law addressing signiﬁcant problems likely to arise during the particular
trial.
The trial book serves three kinds of functions. First, preparation of the book
is a systematic way to prepare for trial. The lawyer is forced to analyze what she
needs for each segment of the trial from voir dire through closing and verdict. The
lawyer is also forced to organize the materials into a whole. Like the production
book for a play, the trial book enables the participants to see the parts and the
whole and to visualize concretely whether the whole makes sense. Second, during
the trial, the trial book is a ready reference. The trial book has everything the lawyer
needs in one place, organized to facilitate easy use. Finally, also during trial, the
trial book serves as a checklist and an organized vehicle for keeping track of what
has been and what needs to be done. Counsel (counsel’s partner) can check off
that essential questions have been asked, that items of documentary evidence have
been not only identiﬁed but also admitted into evidence. The lawyers can keep
notes on particular witnesses and for reference in closing argument. This section
describes the components typically included in a trial book and the relationships
between each component, the other analytic devices, and the actual phases of the
trial.5
1. The preliminary memorandum: an overview of theory, theme, and strategy. The
lawyer must go into trial with a theory of the case. In this context, the theory of the
case must combine the legal theory, the factual theory, and a strategic theory on
how the evidence and arguments should be presented at trial. In preparing the ﬁnal
chart, the Wigmorean lawyer either knows the legal principles the trier of fact will
apply or has made judgments about those the trier can be persuaded to apply.6 He
or she has identiﬁed the central facts-in-issue, the penultimate probanda that are
in dispute, that must be proved (or challenged). The charts have made it possible
5 The trial book may take many forms: An indexed notebook, a series of folders, or in a complex
case, an entire ﬁle cabinet or several boxes, today, the portable computer into which documents,
deposition transcripts, and other material have been loaded with programs that make it possible to
search and ﬁnd particular items almost instantaneously. Many trial advocacy manuals have sections
that describe the author’s view of how a trial notebook should be organized. See for example Mauet
(2005) 34–37 or Haydock and Sonsteng (1999).
6 This presentation focuses on preparing a case in which the outcome hinges on disputed questions
of fact. Many cases, especially in public law areas, hinge upon how disputed questions of law will
be resolved. Some cases, of course, depend upon the resolution of questions of fact and of law,
which occasionally remain unanswered as the trial begins. The structure of the trial book and its
components vary with the function to be served, but the lines of attack and organization are always
similar to those described here.

to identify the plausible logical theories that appear to offer sound opportunities to
persuade the trier of fact that the ultimate probanda have (or have not) been proven.
The rules of admissibility have been analyzed to determine the evidential data that
is likely to be admitted and how it may be used at trial. This analysis provides the
material from which the lawyer must choose the theory of the case (and perhaps
alternative and fall-back theories) that will be used at trial. The objective must be
to choose the theory most likely to maximize the probability of a successful (and to
minimize the risk of an adverse) outcome for the client.
The lawyer must also know by that time the characters and materials she must
use to present the facts at trial and must have made judgments on the relative
plausibility of the stories that could be developed to make the theories dramatically
coherent and effective. With this background, the lawyer must also decide what
themes can be established and used to develop the available theories and reinforce
the stories. In this context, themes make explicit the concept of persuasive pre-
sentation. Who are the good guys? The bad guys? What ideas need emphasis to
create an impression that will enhance the jury’s willingness to accept the story
chosen?
In preparation for trial, the lawyer must consider and make strategic judgments
in choosing among the available theories, the possible themes, and the plausibility
of the resulting stories as a whole. The lawyer at this stage must choose a theory and
themes that are consistent with each other and that reinforce the desired story and
then must organize the evidence so that it can be presented at trial in a manner that
will make themes and theory come together as a dramatically effective and plausible
story-as-a-whole. The preliminary memorandum is a device to document and test
the choices made and to provide an overview of the parts that follow.
Components of a preliminary memorandum typically include:
a The introduction. A short summary and outline: Who is suing whom for what on what
basis? What does the “whom” want and on what basis? What are the one or two
central facts, the jugular facts, or legal questions upon which the case hinges? How
will these be addressed? How is the memorandum organized?
b The facts. The facts distilled to those essential to the theory and presented to tell the
story and illustrate the chosen themes.7 (The uses of stories and themes are
addressed in Chapters 6 and 10.) The task here requires skills similar to those
necessary for the art of preparing the statement of facts in an appellate brief.8
Typically, these are the intermediate probanda that counsel believes will be
7 Many courts require a pre-trial memorandum designed both to identify and narrow the facts and
legal questions in dispute and to establish the parameters of the evidence to be offered. Because it
is “published” to the court and opposing counsel, the strategic considerations differ; otherwise, its
functions are similar.
