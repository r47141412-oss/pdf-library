will be debated in the future. They represent “ﬁrst principles” that can usefully be
employed by an advocate in urging that a speciﬁc rule of procedure or of evidence
should be construed in a manner that favors the outcome she seeks – that is, they
provide a basis for constructing arguments to persuade a court that the advocate’s
position is consistent with the assumptions upon which the system is based and
that her opponent’s is not.
An understanding of these assumptions serves further purposes for law students.

1. The tradition described
The central tenet of the Rationalist Tradition is that the primary objective of adjec-
tive(orprocedural)lawistheachievementof“rectitudeofdecision”inadjudication,
that is to say the correct application of law to facts proved to be true. That tenet has
threecorollariesthatbearuponthepresententerprise.First,withrespecttodisputed
questionsoffact,thetenetassumesthatrealizationofthatobjectiveinvolvesthepur-
suit of “truth” through rational means.2 That corollary requires assumptions of two
kinds – epistemological assumptions concerning the possibility of making accurate
present judgments about past events and reasoning assumptions concerning the
principles to be applied to maximize the likelihood that present judgments about
past events will be accurate. Second, the Rationalist Tradition reﬂects a persistent
recognitionthatpursuitoftruthhasahigh,butnotoverriding,priorityasameansto
secure justice under law (expletive justice). Third, the model of adjudication is itself
instrumentalist in that the pursuit of truth through reason is only a means to achiev-
ing the end of expletive justice viewed as the implementation of substantive law.
Given this central tenet, the characteristic assumptions of discourse about evi-
dence within the Rationalist Tradition can be succinctly stated: Epistemology is
cognitivist rather than skeptical; a correspondence theory of truth is generally pre-
ferred to a coherence theory of truth;3 the mode of decision-making is seen as
2 Critical theorists, postmodernists, and others argue that this is not how judges or juries, in fact,
resolve disputed questions of fact. See, e.g., Graham (1987); cf. Twining (1988); see also Nicolson
(1994), Siegel (1994). The main “strategies of scepticism” are discussed in Rethinking, Ch. 4. Even
they, however, would acknowledge that established rules require that decisions resolving such
questions must be rationally justiﬁable.
3 In the view of the authors, philosophical debates about coherence and correspondence theories of
truth are not crucially important in this context as the model is ﬂexible enough to accommodate
both kinds of theory. Historically most Anglo-American writers on evidence seem to have assumed
some correspondence assumptions (Bentham’s theory of ﬁctions being a notable exception). Our
own position approximates more closely to the “foundeherentism” of Haack (1993).

Analysis of Evidence
“rational,” as contrasted with “irrational” modes such as battle, compurgation, or
ordeal; the characteristic mode of reasoning is induction; and the pursuit of truth,
as a means to justice under the law, commands a high, but not necessarily an over-
riding, priority as a social value.
The basic assumptions that underlie the Rationalist Tradition are summarized
in the form of two models in table 3.1.
The ﬁrst model, Model I, reconstructs a “Rationalist Model of Adjudication”; the
second model, Model II, articulates the main epistemological and logical assump-
tions of standard evidence discourse to be found in specialized secondary writings
about evidence in the Anglo-American tradition. Part A of Model I is prescriptive:
It states an aspiration and a standard by which actual rules, institutions, procedures,
and practices may be evaluated. Acceptance of such standards involves no necessary
commitment to the view that a particular system, or some aspect of it, at a particular
time satisﬁes these standards either in its design or in its actual operation. Part B
of the model is intended to represent typical claims or judgments of the kind “on
the whole the system works well.” None of the leading theorists in the Rationalist
Tradition were perfectionists who expected one hundred per cent conformity with
the ideal. Some were highly critical of existing arrangements and practices.4
Ifthepropositionsofthesecondmodelrepresentstandardelementsinrationalist
theories of evidence, it should be clear that it is artiﬁcial to make a sharp distinction
between theories of evidence and theories of adjudication: Generally speaking, the
former presuppose or form part of the latter. Although there appears to be less of
a consensus in the relevant literature about the ends and the achievements of the
Anglo-American system of adjudication than about the logic and epistemology of
proof, it is possible to postulate a rationalist model of adjudication as an ideal type
that both ﬁts a rationalist theory of evidence and is recognizable as a reasonably
sophisticated version of a widely held, if controversial, view. The ﬁrst model is a
modiﬁed version of a Benthamite model of adjudication, presented in a way that
suggests a number of possible points of departure or disagreement. Although not
all leading evidence scholars have been legal positivists and utilitarians, a rationalist
theory of evidence necessarily presupposes a theory of adjudication that postulates
something like Bentham’s “rectitude of decision” as the main objective. There is
scope for divergence on a number of points of detail, but not from what might be
called the “rational core.”
It is reasonable, and sufﬁcient for present purposes, to assert that by and large
the leading Anglo-American scholars and theorists of evidence from Gilbert (1754)
to Wigmore (and, for the most part, until the present) have either implicitly or
explicitly accepted assumptions such as these, although not in this particular for-
mulation. Two ideas were shared by all. First, they accepted as given the view that
4 Indeed Bentham, whose Rationale of Judicial Evidence (1827) is the main source of the model,
made his theory of adjudication the basis for a radical and far-ranging critique of English (and, to
a lesser extent, Scottish and continental) procedure, practice, and rules of evidence in his day. See
Rethinking at 71–92.

the Anglo-American system has adopted a “rational” mode of determining issues of
fact in contrast with older “irrational” modes of proof. Second, a particular view of
“rationality”wasadoptedortakenforgranted.Thisviewfounditsclassicexpression
in English empirical philosophy in the writings of Bacon, Locke, and John Stuart
Mill.
ThisaccountoftheRationalistTraditionhasananalytical(aswellasanhistorical)
aspect. Analytically, it is an attempt to reconstruct in the form of an “ideal type”
an account of a set of basic assumptions about the aims and nature of adjudication
and what is involved in reasoning about disputed questions of fact in that context.
The test of success of this ideal type is its clarity, coherence, and usefulness as a
tool of analysis of evidence discourse and doctrine. But in applying this test, it is
important to distinguish between aspirational and complacent rationalism in respect
of adjudication. The claim that the modern system of adjudication is “rational” is a
statement of what is considered to be a feasible aspiration of the system; it does not
necessarily involve commitment to the view that this aspiration is always, generally,
or even sometimes, realized in practice. It is commonplace within the Rationalist
Tradition to criticize existing practices, procedures, rules, and institutions in terms
of their failure to satisfy the standards of this aspirational model.
It is also useful to differentiate a third category, which might be referred to as
optimistic rationalism. In invoking prescriptive standards, one often makes some
judgment about the prospects for attaining or approximating such standards in
practice in a given context. In the case of many writers on evidence and judicial
processwhoacceptedsomevariantofPartAoftherationalistmodelofadjudication,
it is reasonable to attribute to them the view that its standards represent a feasible
aspiration rather than a remote or unattainable Utopian ideal. Even virulently criti-
cal writers such as Bentham and Frank can be shown to have believed that their own
favored recommendations would in practice lead to signiﬁcant increases in the level
of rationality in adjudication. They were optimistic rationalists. In brief, almost
all the leading writers in the mainstream of Anglo-American evidence scholarship
were aspirational rationalists; most were optimistic rationalists most of the time;
and many, but by no means all, were fairly complacent about the general operation
of the adversary system in their own jurisdiction in their day.5
2. Principles of proof, rules of procedure and evidence,
and the Rationalist Tradition
Contemporary rules of procedure and evidence make it clear that the assumptions
identiﬁed in the Rationalist Tradition remain dominant today. Although a detailed
analysis is beyond the scope of this book, the importance of those assumptions in
understanding contemporary rules can be usefully illustrated here. We offer the
illustrations that follow for two reasons – to suggest perspectives that students
may wish to consider in studying the formal rules regulating procedure and the

available stock of knowledge about the common course of events; this is largely a
matter of common sense supplemented by specialized scientiﬁc or expert
knowledge when it is available.
7 The pursuit of truth (i.e. seeking to maximize accuracy in fact-determination) is
to be given a high, but not necessarily an overriding, priority in relation to other
values, such as the security of the state, the protection of family relationships, or
the curbing of coercive methods of interrogation.
8 One crucial basis for evaluating “fact-ﬁnding” institutions, rules, procedures,
and techniques is how far they are estimated to maximize accuracy in
fact-determination – but other criteria such as speed, cheapness, procedural
fairness, humaneness, public conﬁdence, and the avoidance of vexation for
participants are also to be taken into account.
9 The primary role of applied forensic psychology and forensic science is to
provide guidance about the reliability of different kinds of evidence and to
develop methods and devices for increasing such reliability.
Note: Prescriptive rationalism: acceptance of A as both desirable and reasonably feasible. No commitment to B.
Complacent rationalism: acceptance of A & B in re a particular system.

Analysis of Evidence
admissibility and use of evidence in the courts, and to aid students in understanding
the role that the principles of proof play in contemporary trial practice.
Contemporary rules clearly reﬂect the central tenets of the Rationalist Tradition,
although recent developments reﬂect a greater concern for ﬁnality and efﬁciency
with concomitant reduced concern for establishing the truth. Consider, for exam-
ple, the standards speciﬁed in the United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
Criminal Procedure, and Evidence. The rules governing civil cases are “to be con-
strued to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.”6
The rules governing criminal proceedings “are intended to provide for the just
determination of every criminal proceeding” and are to be “construed to secure
simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and the elimination of unjusti-
ﬁable expense and delay.”7 The rules regulating the admission and use of evidence
in both kinds of proceedings are to be “construed to secure fairness in administra-
tion, elimination of unjustiﬁable expense and delay, and promotion of growth and
development of the law of evidence to the end that truth may be ascertained and
proceedings justly determined.”8
In England, the contemporary rules of civil procedure reﬂect a similar shift. They
have been substantially reformed following the recommendations of Lord Woolf’s
Final Report on Access to Justice (1996). The main concern underlying these reforms
wastoreducecost,delay,andcomplexity;theprincipaloutcomehasbeentotransfer
the main responsibility for case management from the parties and their lawyers to
the courts. Some consider that the rules will have the tendency to sacriﬁce concern
for rectitude of decision to efﬁciency. Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1999)
(CPR) states:
Rule 1(1) These Rules are a new procedural code with the overriding objective of
enabling the court to deal with cases justly.
Rule 1.1(2) Dealing with a case justly includes, so far as is practicable: (a) ensuring that
the parties are on an equal footing; (b) saving expenses; (c) dealing with the case in ways
which are proportionate (i) to the amount of money involved; (ii) to the importance
of the case; (iii) to the complexity of the issues; (iv) to the ﬁnancial position of each
party; (d) ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously and fairly; and (e) allotting to it an
appropriate share of the court’s resources, while taking into account the need to allot
resources to other cases.9
A detailed study of these US Federal Rules would raise interesting questions.
Each suggests or states that the ascertainment of truth and the correct application of

8 Fed. R. Evid. 102. The position in England is similar. For example, Professor Ian Dennis writes:
“Part of the aims of the law of evidence is therefore to articulate the constraints on the principle of
free proof which would be logically entailed by the rationalist model of adjudication. Some of the
criteria for constraint and their rationale are a matter of considerable and continuing controversy,
but certain points seem reasonably plain” (Dennis (2002) 27). Dennis then usefully considers these
constraints under four heads: (a) Expense and delay; (b) Procedural fairness; (c) Avoidance of error;
(d) Pursuit of other values (id. 23–29).

substantive law is an important objective. Each, however, also states that potentially
conﬂicting values, such as speed and the elimination of unjustiﬁable delay and
expense, are also to be taken into account. None says how the balance is to be struck
generally or in speciﬁc cases. Nor is it clear why the formulations in the three general
codesadoptedintheUnitedStatesthroughsimilarprocessesbythesameauthorities
are different or whether and to what extent the differences in language are intended
to have any practical consequences in application.
Partial answers to the questions that might be raised would require consideration
of the kinds of aspirations the rules reﬂect and the reactions generated by current
dissatisfaction with the seeming inability of the bench and bar to achieve them.
There are few complacent rationalists in modern society. No one seriously claims
that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have promoted “speedy and inexpensive
determinations in every action” that comes before the American federal courts.
Quite the contrary, many of those who now vigorously urge a turn to methods of
alternative dispute resolution can fairly be characterized as pessimistic rationalists
who think the aspirations of Model I can no longer be realized in the traditional
model of adjudication. The extent to which plea bargaining is the principal means
of resolving criminal proceedings reﬂects similar dissatisfaction on the criminal
side.
Another part of the answer, a more important part for those who expect to prac-
tice in the system, may emerge from an understanding that the process through
which the Federal Rules were formulated was political and the interests represented
in that process reﬂect divergent views as to how the balance should be struck.10 As
a practical matter, the rules ultimately adopted reﬂect political compromises, not
articulations of principles viewed as theoretically correct. In this context, two points
should be noted. First, ambiguity is a form of political compromise – the conﬂict
that cannot be resolved is deferred and left for case-by-case resolution in the courts.
Second, and perhaps related, the modern trend has been to expand the discretion
of the trial judge and to restrict the scope of review on appeal from decisions on
procedural or evidentiary matters. Thus, the political battle is legitimated and pro-
ceeds in the courts on a day-to-day, case-by-case basis. How discretion is exercised
in construing a rule may largely be a function of the social views of the particular
judge, tempered by the persuasiveness of counsel.
These points suggest some perspectives that students may ﬁnd useful in studying
procedural and evidentiary rules. First, modern rules of procedure and formal
rules of evidence are relatively recent phenomena. The very lack of complacency
10 The proceedings that led to the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence are described in the
Senate Judiciary Committee Report that accompanied the bill proposed to enact the rules. S. Rep.
No. 1277, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1974 U.S. Code, Cong. & Admin. News 7051–7052,
7054–7055. The political aspect of the history of the Federal Rules of Evidence is emphasized in
Wright & Graham (1977) §§5001–5006. Section 5006 deals directly with the drafting history. The
legislative history, including the statements of those who appeared at the hearings in the House and
Senate, is reproduced in Bailey and Trelles (1980). Amendments to the rules since their adoption
are listed in Federal Rules of Evidence (House Judiciary Committee Print 2003) at v–x available at
http://www.house.gov/judiciary/committee documents.

is reﬂected in the frequency with which these rules are amended. Anyone studying
such rules at a particular time should pay as much attention to the history of a
rule and the political processes by which it reached its present formulation as to
the text currently in force. The goal should be to understand the interests and
the compromises reﬂected in the rule. The rules are likely to change during any
practitioner’s career to reﬂect changes in the relative political power of those whose
interests are affected. In this view, the notes of the advisory committees, the Federal
Judicial Center, and the legislative committees concerning rules that were rejected
or amended at various stages and the proposals that were rejected may be more
revealing than the rule that was actually adopted. In England, both criminal and
civil evidence have been a recurrent focus of attention in the past thirty years.11
Second, something very similar to the prescriptive norms expressed in Model
I remain the norms that deﬁne the range within which contemporary debates are
conducted.Thosewhoargueforchangeordinarilyframetheirargumentstodemon-
strate that the changes they seek will enhance the likelihood that truth will be ascer-
tained without imposing further or undue costs or other burdens or, alternatively,
that the change will reduce the costs or other burdens or will promote fairness
in administration without signiﬁcantly diminishing the likelihood that truth will
be ascertained. Some contemporary theorists argue that the assumptions underly-
ing the model are ﬂawed and are merely political camouﬂage used to legitimate the
status quo and that changes are designed to protect or enhance it. Nonetheless, these
critics have yet to propose a serious alternative model.12 For that reason, proposals
for change and arguments for construction and application are likely to proceed
within the framework of the Rationalist Tradition for the foreseeable future. Thus,
as a practical matter, lawyers should develop the ability to use the prescriptive norms
effectively in argument.
Contemporary rules of procedure and evidence also make clear the centrality of
the principles of inductive reasoning and argument. The Federal Rules of Evidence
governing relevance may be fairly viewed as an attempt to codify the assumptions
underlying the rationalist theories of evidence and proof. For example, evidence
is relevant if and only if it has some “tendency to make the existence of any fact
that is of consequence to the litigation more probable or less probable than it
would be without the evidence.”13 That rule can only be viewed as mandating a
demonstration that requires the application of the principles of inductive logic to
persuade a judge that the evidence under consideration, alone or in combination
with other evidence, supports an inference or a chain of inferences that increases or
decreasesthelikelihoodthatafactofconsequenceistrue.Therulethatmandatesthe
admission of relevant evidence unless there exist speciﬁed grounds for its exclusion
assumes that truth is an objective that can be achieved through rational means and
establishes a base for assessing its priority in particular situations.14

Principles of proof

From that perspective, most of the remaining rules of evidence can be viewed
as falling into three categories – rules that justify the exclusion of evidence on the
ground that it has improper prejudicial effects that outweigh its probative value,15
rules that mandate or reﬂect a cost-beneﬁt analysis to prevent undue delay or con-
sumption of time,16 and rules that reﬂect extrinsic policies viewed as overriding the
ascertainment of truth as an objective.17 It should be clear that rules in the ﬁrst two
categories also typically require application of the principles of inductive reasoning
to identify the particular improper prejudice that evidence may generate and to
frame the arguments that bear upon a comparison of the legitimate probative value
and the illegitimate prejudicial effects in the particular case.
We develop the speciﬁc uses of the principles in constructing such arguments
later. For the moment, it should sufﬁce to note that the principles of practical
reasoning and the assumptions upon which they are based will remain central to
the common law model of adjudication, notwithstanding any changes that may be
made in the formal rules. For that reason, the ability to apply them in analysis and
argument is and will remain an essential lawyering skill.
C. Rationale
Wigmoreprovidedthestarting-pointofourwork,anditisimportanttounderstand
his conception of the subject of evidence in law and how its two main parts (the
principles of proof and the trial rules) are related. The following is his opening
statement at the start of The Science.
§1. What Is the Science of Judicial Proof? The study of the principles of Evidence,
for a lawyer, falls into two distinct parts. One is Proof in the general sense, – the part
concerned with the ratiocinative process of contentious persuasion, – mind to mind,
counsel to judge or juror, each partisan seeking to move the mind of the tribunal. The
other part is Admissibility, – the procedural rules devised by the law, and based on
litigious experience and tradition, to guard the tribunal (particularly the jury) against
erroneous persuasion. Hitherto, the latter has loomed largest in our formal studies, –
has, in fact, monopolized them; while the former, virtually ignored, has been left to the
chances of later acquisition, casual and empiric, in the course of practice. Here we have
been wrong; and in two ways.
15 The general principle is stated in Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Rules often have characteristics
that reﬂect justiﬁcations from more than one category. Rules 404 and 609, for example, may fairly
be viewed as codiﬁcations covering recurring situations where the improper prejudicial effects
presumptively outweigh the legitimate probative value, but these rules also reﬂect values unrelated
to the pure search for truth, such as the values expressed in the idea of judging “the act not the
actor.” See Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172 (1997); R. v. Sang [1980] A.C. 402 (Eng.).
16 See Rule 403 (the general principle); see also, e.g., Rules 405 (methods of proving character),
701–704 (opinions and expert testimony), 902 (self-authenticating documents).
17 The clearest examples are the rules protecting privileged communications, now reﬂected in
Rule 501, and the constitutional exclusionary rules adopted to regulate improper conduct by
law enforcement ofﬁcers without regard to the often dispositive probative value of the evidence
thereby excluded.

Analysis of Evidence
For one thing, there is, and there must be, a probative science – the principles of
proof – independent of the artiﬁcial rules of procedure; hence, it can be and should be
studied. This science, to be sure, may as yet be imperfectly formulated. But all the more
need is there to begin in earnest to investigate and develop it. Furthermore, this process
of Proof represents the objective in every judicial investigation. The procedural rules
for Admissibility are merely a preliminary aid to the main activity, viz., the persuasion
of the tribunal’s mind to a correct conclusion by safe materials. This main process is
that for which the jury are there, and on which the counsel’s duty is focused.
And, for another thing, the judicial rules of Admissibility are destined to lessen
in relative importance during the next period of development. Proof will assume the
important place; and we must therefore prepare ourselves for this shifting of emphasis.
We must seek to acquire a scientiﬁc understanding of the principles of what may be
called “natural” proof, – the hitherto neglected process . . .
The principles of Proof, then, represent the natural processes of the mind in dealing
with the evidential facts after they are admitted to the jury; while the rules of Admis-
sibility represent the artiﬁcial legal rules peculiar to our Anglo-American jury-system.
Hence the formershouldbestudiedﬁrst.Theybringinto play those reasoning processes
which are already the possession of intelligent and educated persons. They familiarize
the practitioner with the materials most commonly presented in trials at law, and thus
prepare him to take up more readily the artiﬁcial rules of Admissibility devised by
judicial experience for safeguarding legal investigations of fact.
Moreover, this process of Proof is after all the most important in the trial. The trial
culminates in either Proof or non-Proof. When the evidence is all in, the counsel sets
himself to his ultimate and crucial task, i.e. that of persuading the jury that they should
or should not believe the fact alleged in the issue. To do this, he must reason naturally,
as all men reason and as juries can be shown how to reason. He must have familiarized
himself with the logical processes which men naturally use, and with general experience
as to the classes of inferences commonly called for in legal trials. Here he has no use for
the artiﬁcial rules of Admissibility. Those have been disposed of, at the outset, by the
judge.Theevidenceisin,andthequestionnowis,Whatisitseffect?Alltheartiﬁcialrules
of Admissibility might be abolished; yet the principles of Proof would remain, so long as
trials remain as a rational attempt to seek the truth in legal controversies . . . (Wigmore,
Science §1 and 2)
Notes and questions on rules of evidence concerning relevance
1. The deﬁnition of relevance is the law’s codiﬁcation of the principles of logic.
Consider the following provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence:
Rule 401. Deﬁnition of “Relevant Evidence.” “Relevant evidence” means evidence having
any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the deter-
mination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the
evidence.18
18 Strictly speaking, the only facts of consequence in a case are the penultimate probanda (including
any probanda asserting an afﬁrmative defense) and probanda undermining or reinforcing the
credibility of evidence that is relevant to a penultimate probandum.

Rule 402. Relevant Evidence Generally Admissible: Irrelevant Evidence Inadmissible. All
relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the
United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the
Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Evidence which is not relevant is not
admissible.
To what extent are the foregoing provisions a codiﬁcation of principles of
“proof”? Are any of the provisions rules of “admissibility”? Would archeologists,
historians, and scientists accept the law’s deﬁnition of relevance for application in
their ﬁelds? What provisions of the rule deal with problems that are peculiar to
courts?
2. Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is central. It provides:
Rule 403. Exclusion of Relevant Evidence on Grounds of Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of
Time. Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading
the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation
of cumulative evidence.

misleading, or other improper prejudicial effects (PE) of the proffered evidential
data must be identiﬁed and appraised. The legitimate probative value (PV) must
be determined and weighed. Then the court must determine whether the improper
prejudicial effects substantially outweigh the legitimate probative value – whether
PE ≫PV.
a What effects are improperly prejudicial? How should we measure the legitimate
probative value?
b Consider propositions 11 and 21 from the exercise at pages 41–43 above. The ultimate
proposition to be proved is that “It was X who murdered Y.” The prosecutor wishes to
offer evidence to show that:
11 X has two convictions for shoplifting; the most recent occurred ﬁve years ago.
21 Z [an alibi witness for X] is a prostitute.
Is evidence that supports either proposition relevant? If so, to what “fact that is
of consequence” in an action to determine whether “It was X who murdered Y”?
Be precise. Would a scientist or an historian consider either proposition relevant?
Should either or both propositions be admissible under Rule 403? State the analysis
in support of and in opposition to admission precisely.

Rule 404. Character Evidence Not Admissible to Prove Conduct; Exceptions; Other Crimes
(a) Character evidence generally. Evidence of a person’s character or a trait of his
character is not admissible for the purpose of proving that he acted in conformity
therewith on a particular occasion, except;

Analysis of Evidence
(i) Character of accused. Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an
accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same; . . .
(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not
admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in
conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as
proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or
absence of mistake or accident.19
Is Rule 404 a codiﬁcation of a principle of proof or a rule restricting admissibility
and use of logically relevant evidence? If it is a rule of admissibility, what values are
served by this departure from the goal of “truth ascertainment”? Consider again
propositions 11 and 22 set out above. Would Rule 404 require the exclusion of
evidence offered to prove either or both propositions? Does Rule 404 suggest a
policy that might enhance an argument that either or both propositions should in
any event be excluded under Rule 403?
D. Notes on terminology and inferential relationships
In any inquiry that seeks to determine what happened based upon evidence, the
person conducting the inquiry must have or develop a hypothesis to be tested (some-
times framed as a question to be answered). Although the hypothesis will often be
reﬁned during the investigation and analysis, a meaningful analysis can not be taken
without a preliminary hypothesis. In determining whether evidence is relevant, the
analyst must answer the question, “Relevant to what?” The “what” is the hypothesis.
In legal contexts, the hypothesis is established by the governing law. In other
words, assuming the applicable rule of law is clear, the proposition to be proved is a
proposition that includes each of the material facts that must be proved in order to
satisfy the conditions speciﬁed by the rule. Wigmore adopted and adapted the Latin
term “factum probandum” (or simply “probandum”) to designate a proposition to
be proved.
If one views the applicable rule of law as the major premise in a deductive
argument,thentheultimateprobandumistheminorpremise.Forexample,atypical
statute deﬁning murder might read, “Murder is the unlawful killing of a human
being . . . with malice aforethought.” That statute might be restated as the major
premise of a syllogism as:
If a human being (a victim) is dead, and the victim died as a result of an unlawful
act, and it was the accused who committed the act that caused the victim’s death, and
the person who committed the act acted with malice aforethought, then the accused is
guilty of murder.
In a murder case, the ultimate probandum would be the proposition that satisﬁed
the requirements of the rule as restated. In “An investigation” presented in Chapter 1

at pp. 40–43, the ultimate probandum the prosecution would have to prove might
be stated as:
UP:
Y is dead; and Y died as a result of an unlawful act; and it was X who
committed the act that caused Y’s death; and X acted with malice afore-
thought in committing the act.20
The illustrations that follow draw upon propositions given in that exercise. To limit
the need to refer back, propositions used here have been renumbered.
In almost all instances, an ultimate probandum that is stated in formal terms
is a compound statement, a statement containing more than one simple proposi-
tion. Under any method of analysis one of the ﬁrst steps requires that the analyst
divide (and sometimes subdivide) the ultimate probandum into simple proposi-
tions, what Wigmore called and we will refer to as the “penultimate probanda.” Thus,
the penultimate probanda in “An investigation” were that:
1 Y is dead.
2 Y died as the result of an unlawful act.
3 It was X who committed the act that caused Y’s death.
4 X acted with malice aforethought in committing the act.
A penultimate probandum is a synonym for familiar terms used in other legal
contexts. A penultimate probandum is a material fact. (The terms fact-in-issue and
ultimate fact are synonyms in this context.) A penultimate probandum is also a
fact of consequence, but the term fact of consequence includes more than just the
penultimate probanda in a case. For example, when a witness takes the stand her
credibility becomes a fact of consequence. So too, inferred propositions, such as the
accused had motive or had opportunity, are often called facts of consequence.21
All evidential data presented at trial must be presented in a form that the triers
of fact can perceive with their senses. This evidence consists of only two types: testi-
monial assertions made by a witness from the witness stand, that is, oral statements
the triers of fact actually hear, and physical objects displayed to the triers of fact or,
rarely, other forms of evidential data that can be perceived by one or more of the
senses.22
To avoid confusion, it is important to have terms that enable us to distinguish
evidential data that the jurors (or other decision-makers) will perceive with one
of their senses – will hear, see, smell, taste, or touch – from the propositions that
the jurors will be asked to infer from those data. Specialized terminology is helpful
20 In that problem, the police cadet had an assigned standpoint. He was a police cadet assigned, at
the outset of the investigation, to analyze information as it was developed. One of the hypotheses
the evidence suggested was, “It was X who committed the act that caused Y’s death.” (Standpoint
is an important concept that is developed fully in Ch. 4.)
21 See above, n. 18.
22 Stipulated, admitted, or judicially noticed facts might be considered a third class, but these facts
are actually inferences that triers of fact are instructed to accept as proven.

Analysis of Evidence
because the terms “fact” and “evidence” have many overlapping and imprecise
meanings. For example, a lawyer might properly argue that:
a
the fact that X had a motive to murder Y is evidence that X did murder Y.
b
the fact X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m., the time and place of Y’s murder, is evidence
that X had opportunity to murder Y.
c
W3’s testimony that he saw X running out of Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. is evidence that
W exited Y’s house at 4:45 p.m., which in turn is evidence that X was in Y’s house at
4:30 p.m.
Most listeners would understand each of these assertions notwithstanding the fact
that the words “fact” and “evidence” had a different meaning in each.
In a trial, W3’s testimonial assertion about X’s departure would be an evidential
datum – an assertion the trier of fact would hear. The existence of an evidential
datum cannot be contested. For example, if a witness testiﬁed, “The moon is made
of green cheese,” the fact that the statement was made could not be disputed. But
no one would accept the inference that the moon is in fact made of green cheese.
Instead, most would infer that the witness was lying or was crazy or had a strange
sense of humor.
Wigmore adopted the term autoptic proference to describe an evidential datum
that the decision-makers will perceive with one of their ﬁve senses.23 In the chapters
thatfollow,theterms autoptic proference or evidential datum areusedtoidentifyevi-
dence that the fact-ﬁnder will hear or see or otherwise perceive through their senses.
An autoptic proference is only relevant if it makes a fact of consequence more
or less probable than it would be in the absence of the autoptic proference. A fact
of consequence is always a proposition to be inferred, a factum probandum. It is
rare, however, that a penultimate probandum can be directly inferred from an
autoptic proference. In almost all instances, there are one or more intermediate
propositions, probanda, that must be accepted in order to demonstrate the logical
relationship between the evidential datum and the penultimate probandum it is
offered to support.
Wigmore also used the term “factum probans” to describe an inferential propo-
sition that is offered as support for a further inference, a factum probandum. It is
important to note the terms “factum probans” and “factum probandum” can refer
to the same proposition. Using this terminology, an autoptic proference is offered
to support a factum probandum, which then becomes a “factum probans” offered to
supportafurther“factumprobandum.”Wehavedroppedtheword“factum,”butthe
terms “probans” and “probandum” are used throughout the remainder of the book.
The point can be illustrated using propositions presented in “An investigation.”
For example, from proposition 2, renumbered proposition 5 here, we may assume
that at trial:
23 This admittedly awkward term is more precise and broader than the commonly used “real
evidence,” which is ambiguous.

5 W1 will testify, “I saw a person with characteristics a, b, c, and d enter Y’s house at
4:15 p.m. on January 1.”
From this autoptic proference, we must ﬁrst infer the truth of the matter asserted:
6 A person with characteristics a, b, c, and d entered Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1.
Standing alone, neither the testimonial assertion, an autoptic proference, nor the
inferred proposition is relevant to the provisional penultimate probandum:
3 It was X who murdered Y.
But there is another autoptic proference, the appearance of X, that the decision-
maker would see,
7 X
From which she might infer,
8 X has characteristics a, b, c, and d.
The decision-maker might then combine inferred proposition 5 and 6, now each a
probans, to support a further probandum:
9 It was X who entered Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1.
An advocate might urge that proposition 9 supports a further inference:
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.
based upon a generalization:
11 People who enter a house usually remain for more than ﬁfteen minutes.
That advocate could then argue that the assumed proposition 12 (based on propo-
sition 1 in “An investigation”),
12 Y died in his home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1 as the result of an unlawful act
committed by another person,
combines with inferred proposition 10 to support a further inference,
13 X had an opportunity to commit the act that caused Y’s death,
which in turn makes the fact of consequence, penultimate probandum 3 above,
3 It was X who committed the act that caused Y’s death,
somewhat more probable than it would in the absence of the autoptic proferences
set out in propositions 5 and 6.
It may be easier to understand the relationships among these propositions if they
were depicted in charted form. This can be done using three of the symbols used in
the “Chart method of analysis” which is presented in the next chapter. A testimonial
