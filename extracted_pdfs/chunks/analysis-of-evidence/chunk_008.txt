Analysis of Evidence
assertion that the tribunal will hear from the witness stand is always depicted by a
square –
. All other propositions are depicted by a circle –⃝.Autopticproferences,
as opposed to inferred propositions, are identiﬁed by placing an inﬁnity symbol –
∞– beneath the square or circle representing an assertion the fact-ﬁnder will hear
or a circle depicting an item of evidence that the fact-ﬁnder will see or perceive with
one of her other senses.
The distinction between “inference” and “proof” also needs to be clariﬁed. An
“inference” represents an argument or a claim that there is a logical relationship
between two propositions, that one proposition supports the other. In the chart pre-
sented below, the relationships depicted show the inferential relationships among
the propositions in the keylist. “Proof” (or non-proof) is the result – the con-
clusion to be reached after the inferences have been evaluated.24 If we accept the
claim that, reasoning from the “bottom up,” each of the propositions depicted in
the chart makes the proposition above it in some degree more probable than it
would be in the absence of the supporting proposition, then we have to concede
that the chart accurately depicts the inferential relationships among the charted
propositions. That commitment does not entail any commitment to the conclusion
that the charted propositions “prove” the penultimate probandum to any speci-
ﬁed degree of probability, such as more probable than not or beyond reasonable
doubt. Inferential reasoning and argument is the process; proof or non-proof is the
result.
A preliminary exercise: State v. Archer (I)
A murder has just been reported and the investigation just begun. You are the
prosecuting attorney. The murdered man was named Vern. Detective Paul was
the investigating ofﬁcer. Detective Paul’s preliminary report contains the following
assertion: “I found a scrap of brown Harris tweed cloth clutched in Vern’s right
hand.”Thescrapofclothhasbeenproperlytaggedandpreservedforuseasevidence.
1 Why are Paul’s assertion and the scrap of cloth relevant? Formulate as simple
propositions the testimonial assertions Detective Paul might make. Formulate the
propositions that must be inferred to demonstrate that the autoptic proferences are
relevant to a fact of consequence. Using the preliminary charting scheme suggested
above, chart the tentative inferences that you would make from this assertion and
from the scrap of cloth to guide Detective Paul’s investigation.
2 As a matter of logical process, does the analysis of the available evidence from the
investigator’s standpoint differ from that of the lawyer immediately before trial? If so,
how? If not, why not?
24 There are standards of proof that are to guide the fact-ﬁnder in deciding in whose favor the verdict
or judgment in a case should be returned, and there are standards that deﬁne the limits of the
fact-ﬁnder’s discretion in making that decision. These subjects are addressed in Ch. 8 below.

Analysis of Evidence
E. Probative processes and logical principles
1. Probative processes
Wigmore categorized the main relations between evidentiary propositions in terms
of the probative processes for which they might be offered – proponent’s assertion
(PA),opponent’sdenial(OD),opponent’srival(OR),opponent’sexplanation(OE),
and proponent’s corroborations (PC). These categories establish a vocabulary that
is frequently useful in identifying, advancing, and appraising claims that evidence
or factual arguments are relevant in particular phases of a case.
When a party offers an autoptic proference at trial, she is a proponent claim-
ing that proffered data support an assertion that is relevant. That is a proponent’s
assertion (PA). In most instances, the proponent must also claim that that ini-
tial assertion supports a further assertion (an interim probandum), which in turn
supports a further assertion and so on, until the logical basis for the claim that
the proffered datum makes a fact of consequence more or less probable has been
demonstrated. In the illustration developed above, the prosecution would offer, as
autoptic proferences, propositions 5 and 7 to support proponent’s assertions 6, 8,
and 9. See key-list and chart 3.1 above.
There are three, and only three, ways that the opposing party, the defendant,
could challenge these assertions. He may deny one or more of them, opponent’s
denial (OD); he may offer evidence supporting a conﬂicting rival proposition (OR);
or he may offer alternative explanations for the proffered datum and inferences,
opponent’s explanation (OE).
If the investigation begun in “An investigation” proceeded to trial, X might, for
example, testify,
14 I did not enter Y’s house at any time on January 1,
supporting an inference,
15 X did not enter Y’s house at any time on January 1.
Such a testimonial assertion would be classiﬁed as an opponent’s denial (OD)
because it denies the truth of the inference based upon the testimonial assertion
that would be made by W2 based upon proposition 4 in “An investigation,”
16 W2: I saw X leave Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. on January 1,
supporting a proponent’s assertion offered by the prosecution,
17 X departed from Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. on January 1,
providing additional support for
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.
X might also offer autoptic proferences supporting an opponent’s rival assertion
(OR) based upon proposition 12 in “An investigation”:
18 X: I was in a house ﬁve miles from the scene of the murder from 2 p.m. until 5 p.m.,

supporting an inference, whose strength would depend upon an assessment of X’s
credibility,
19 X was in a house ﬁve miles from the scene of the murder from 2 p.m. until 5 p.m.,
which would rival the proponent’s inferred assertion,
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.
Finally, X might offer one or more alternative explanations that weaken the pro-
bative value of the proponent’s assertion, an opponent’s explanation (OE). There
are two types of opponent’s explanations. The ﬁrst calls attention to alternative
inferences that the proffered datum would also support. For example, in “An inves-
tigation,” W3 would testify (P6),
20 On Christmas Day, I heard X say angrily to Y: “I shall not forget this,”
which the prosecutor might assert supports the inferred assertion,
21 X was angry with Y on Christmas Day,
supporting a further inference,
22 X’s anger with Y continued until January 1,
supporting a further inference,
23 X’s anger gave him a motive to murder,
supporting the penultimate probandum,
3 It was X who committed the act that caused Y’s death.
However, without further evidence, it is clear that there are a number of plausible
alternative explanations for X’s assertion that are too trivial to support a claim of
motive, e.g.,
24 Y may have forgotten to send X a Christmas card, or
25 Y may have embarrassed X at a party or a business meeting,
and so on – and thus tending to explain away and weaken the prosecutor’s claim.
Opponent’s explanations of this kind are implicit in the content or the context from
which the proponent’s assertion arises and require no other evidential support.
The second kind of opponent’s explanation requires further evidence. For exam-
ple, if the charge that X murdered Y proceeded to trial, counsel for the defense might
undermine the probative value of W1’s assertion (P2) that she saw a person with
characteristics a, b, c, and d enter Y’s house through cross-examination. If that
examination forced W1 to admit,
22 W1: I have poor eyesight and was not wearing my glasses on January 1, and
23 W1: It was dark and it was foggy at 4:15 p.m. on January 1,

Analysis of Evidence
counsel could argue that this ancillary evidence supported an opponent’s explana-
tion that W’s assertion should be discounted because W’s observational sensitivity
was impaired.
As Wigmore summarized them, the ﬁve probative processes applicable to any
piece of evidence are:
PA = proponent’s assertion of a fact to evidence a probandum;
OE = opponent’s explanation of other facts taking away the value of this inference PA;
OD = opponent’s denial of the evidentiary fact on which the inference PA is based;
OR = opponent’s rival fact, adduced against the probandum, without any reference to
the inference PA;
PC = proponent’s corroborative facts, negating the explanations OE.
(Science (1937) 46)
2. The logical principles
In the adversarial system, all decisions resolving disputed questions of fact must be
rationally justiﬁable. This requirement has two necessary corollaries:
1 The principles of logic – abductive, inductive, and deductive – can be applied to any
mass of data that constitutes evidence from which we wish to reconstruct past events
in order to resolve disputed questions of fact.
2 The propositions established by these data and those proffered as possible inferred
propositions can be articulated and can be organized and marshaled as arguments
bearing upon the resolution of such disputed questions of fact.25
Some of the principles underlying abductive logic and their application in the
investigative phase of any process were presented and illustrated in Chapter 2. They
are developed and illustrated here in the context of their application in the legal
process.
a. Abductive reasoning. The lawyer must use abductive reasoning in various situ-
ations. Early in a case, for example, a lawyer is typically confronted with sparse data
or with data supplied by a biased source, the client. The lawyer must ask questions
of the data: What hypotheses might account for these data that would be consis-
tent with a result that would advance (or protect) the client’s interests? Given the
plausible hypotheses, what additional data should be available to conﬁrm or negate
them? Frequently, the answers are not apparent. Similarly creative speculation and
testing is frequently required when the lawyer is thinking about data that cannot be
accounted for by any of the provisional theories under consideration or about data
that will support the opposing side’s case unless it can be otherwise explained. What
the lawyer needs to do in such situations is imagine or construct new hypotheses
or possible solutions that may satisfactorily account for the data and then discover
25 For a fuller discussion of the principles and their signiﬁcance to the adversarial model of adjudi-
cation, see Anderson (1991).

sources from which additional evidence to test these hypotheses or solutions might
be obtained. This is creative lawyering.
The materials in Chapter 1 included illustrations of abductive reasoning. The
“Intelligence analyst” was designed to illustrate abductive reasoning (see pages
3–8). In one interpretation, Solomon employed abductive reasoning in identi-
fying the sword as a useful tool to generate additional evidence that would aid
him in deciding the question before him (see pages 2–3). Kemelman and Welt
were engaging in abductive reasoning throughout their analysis in “The Nine Mile
Walk,” especially when they searched for ways to set up and test the hypothesis
that the statement concerning a “nine mile walk” reﬂected events that had actually
occurred (see pages 11–18). The exercises in “An investigation” were designed to
require the police cadet to engage in abductive reasoning at several stages (see pages
40–45). Although not the focus, each of the other exercises in Chapter 1 contains
illustrations of abductive logic or requires its use to “solve” the problem presented
or both.
After discovery is over26 and all planned investigations have been completed, the
lawyer is confronted with the task of analyzing the available evidence to identify,
construct, and appraise arguments that can be used to persuade the tribunal that
the necessary ultimate probandum has or has not been proved with the degree of
certainty required by the applicable standard of proof.27 In theory, the evidence
is as complete as it can be, and the lawyer is only required to analyze a ﬁxed and
deﬁned mass of data. The primary method of reasoning required at this stage is
inductive reasoning: Can the data be marshaled to provide compelling support for
the inferred propositions necessary to the client’s success in the case at hand?
There is, however, a continuing need for abductive reasoning in preparing for

to identify an opponent’s explanations that she may use to explain away assertions
based upon evidential data the opposing party is likely to offer and to identify
explanations that she must anticipate opposing counsel may suggest to weaken or
undermine assertions based upon evidential data she will offer. At the trial stage,
the lawyer can invoke the process of opponent’s explanation (OE) to suggest to the
tribunal alternative hypotheses that might explain away damaging evidence offered
by her opposing counsel. After the trial has begun, however, it is ordinarily too late
to seek new evidence that might support one or more of those explanations and
make it a true rival that might more effectively undermine the proponent’s case.
Abductioniscriticalintheearlystages,whenthereremainstimeforinvestigatingthe
possibilities before committing to a speciﬁc theory on which the case will be tried.
Induction becomes central when the possibilities have been identiﬁed and explored
and the data are as complete as is feasible. The unexamined possibility ﬁrst seen
and raised at trial is ordinarily a sign of desperation or inadequate preparation.

Analysis of Evidence
b. Deductive reasoning. Deductive logic is the process by which we apply a univer-
sal major premise to a particular factual proposition, a minor premise. The classic
illustration is: All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore, Socrates is a mortal.
If the major and minor premises are true, it necessarily follows that the conclu-
sion is true. In a legal case, the applicable rule of law is the major premise and the
ultimate probandum is the minor premise. In the last section, we presented a rule
of law deﬁning murder, a major premise, and the ultimate probandum that must
be proved to satisfy that rule, a minor premise (at pages 90–91). If the ultimate
probandum was true, then it would necessarily be the case that the accused is guilty
of murder.
c. Inductive reasoning28 In analyzing the available evidential data and identify-
ing and marshaling the inferences that those data support in preparing for trial,
the lawyer relies primarily on inductive reasoning. The examples drawn from “An
investigation” developed in the preceding section (at pages 96–98) illustrated the
process of inductive reasoning. The nature of that form of reasoning is developed
further in the discussion of generalizations that follow.
d.Generalizations.Thereisanecessaryrelationshipbetweendeductiveandinduc-
tive reasoning that every lawyer should understand.29 The primary mode of rea-
soning in analyzing the relationships between a speciﬁed mass of evidential data
and a proposition to be proved may be inductive, but effective analysis of those
relationships requires the application of a form of quasi-deductive reasoning.
Wigmore noted the essential point:
[E]very inductive inference is at least capable of being transmuted into and stated in
the deductive form, by forcing into prominence the implied law or generalization on
which it rests more or less obscurely. (Science (1937) 21)
The point requires further development.
i. The importance of generalizations.30 “Generalizations . . . represent the glue that
hold our arguments together” (Schum (1994) 82). Every inference is dependent
upon a generalization. The inductive form of an inference can be converted to a
quasi-deductive form by identifying and articulating the generalization upon which
it depends. Thus, classically, Descartes’s “I think; therefore I am” depends on the
generalization that might be formally stated as “All persons who think are persons
who exist” and converted to a syllogistic form:
All persons who think are persons who exist.
I am a person who thinks.
Therefore, I am a person who exists.31
28 We follow Wigmore and John Stuart Mill in using “induction” to refer to inferential reasoning
that, in this context, is mainly concerned with reasoning towards and justifying conclusions about
particular past events. See generally Walton (1989) and (2002).
29 This is also true of abductive logic. See above at pages 56–58.
30 The roles generalizations play in analysis and argument are explored in greater depth in Ch. 10.
31 Or, to parallel Descartes’s elegant simplicity: All who think are; I think; therefore, I am.

In practice, it is rare that the generalization upon which the justiﬁcation for an
inference depends is a universally true proposition. Usually they have fuzzy quan-
tiﬁers such as, “people who enter a house usually remain for more than ﬁfteen
minutes.”
In most contexts, inductive reasoning operates intuitively. The reasoner does
not consciously identify the generalizations upon which her inferences depend,
unless she is required to justify her conclusions. Even then, she will often ﬁnd
it hard, probably impossible, to articulate the precise generalization upon which
an inference relied, as opposed to articulating an after-the-fact generalization that
she believes justiﬁes her conclusion. For example, a student might report to her
teacher that her friend John did not attend class today because his car would not
start, urging the teacher to conclude that John’s absence should be excused because
it was caused by circumstances beyond his control. The teacher might inquire,
“How do you know his car would not start?” The student might reply, “Because
John told me so.” The teacher might continue the inquiry: “Why does the fact
that he told you his car would not start justify the conclusion that his car, in fact,
would not start?” Forced to justify her inference, she might claim, “Based upon my
past experience with John, I believe John’s assertions are almost always true and
accurate.”
In a legal context, it is frequently important to identify the generalization upon
which an inference depends to determine the strength or the plausibility of the
inference and to identify potential fallacies. Both the importance and the potential
dangers can be simply illustrated.
Many people would accept the generalization, “In most instances, a person who
has committed a violent crime will ﬂee from the scene of that crime.” In “An inves-
tigation,” the cadet learns (P4): “W2 says that he saw X, who was known to him,
running out of Y’s home at 4:45 p.m. on January 1.” Y was murdered in the house at
4:30 p.m. and proposition 4 supports an inference that X was ﬂeeing from the scene
of that crime shortly after it was committed. If the generalization identiﬁed above
were applicable, the cadet might argue that this shows it is likely that X murdered Y.
But that argument would be fallacious. The generalization so framed cannot log-
ically be applied to justify that inference. The only basis upon which an inference
from X’s “ﬂight” to X’s guilt can be justiﬁed is by the far weaker generalization: “In
some instances, a person ﬂeeing from the scene of a serious crime is the person who
has committed that crime.”32 Given the number of plausible explanations, other
than guilt, why someone might ﬂee from the scene of a violent crime, the evidence
provides, at best, only weak support for the inference that X murdered Y.
32 The more detailed “ﬂight” chain of inferences is: “Analytically, ﬂight is an admission by conduct,
and its probative value as circumstantial evidence of guilt depends on the degree of conﬁdence
with which four inferences can be drawn: (1) from defendant’s behavior to ﬂight; (2) from ﬂight
to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the
crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to actual guilt
of the crime charged.” U.S. v. Myers, 550 F.2d 1036. 1039 (5th 1977) (noted as leading case in
McCormick on Evidence, §263 (1999)).

Analysis of Evidence
ii. A note on the nature of generalizations. Generalizations can be classiﬁed using
three axes – a generality axis, a reliability axis, and a source axis. The end points
of the generality axis are marked by generalizations in the most abstract form and
generalizations that have been made speciﬁc to the precise case or context in which
they are to be applied. For example, the abstract, “In some instances a person seen
ﬂeeing from the scene of violent crime may be guilty of that crime,” as opposed to
the context speciﬁc, “It is possible that a person dressed in a suit and tie who was
seen emerging from a ten-unit apartment building and walking rapidly toward a
bus stop 100 yards from the building shortly after a victim had been brutally beaten
with a hammer in that building may be guilty of the crime.”
At one end of the reliability axis are scientiﬁc laws (such as the law of gravity);
well-founded scientiﬁc opinions (such as the conclusions of a qualiﬁed forensic
expert based upon comparison of specimens of handwriting alleged to have been
writtenbythesameindividual);andwidelysharedconclusionsbaseduponcommon
experience (for instance, everyone knows that a driver must stop for a red light). In
the middle are commonly held, but unproven or unprovable, beliefs (for instance,
ﬂeeing the scene of a crime is evidence of a guilty conscience). At the other end
are biases or prejudices that may be strongly held irrespective of available data (for
instance, women do not make good trial lawyers; men are generally poor single
parents; whites cannot fairly sit as jurors when a black is on trial, etc.) and less
strongly held but still operative beliefs (for instance, a person’s actions usually
conform to her motives).
Finally, the source axis may range from generalizations based upon repeated
personal experience to those based on acquired knowledge to “synthetic/intuitive”
generalizations33 whose source the person formulating the generalizations cannot
identify. Based upon personal experience, the authors believe that, “In Miami,
Florida,thesunshinesforsomeperiodoftimeonmostdaysoftheyear.”Basedupon
their studies the authors believe, “Gravitational force is proportional to the masses,
and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.” Although
none of the authors could identify its source, each accepts the generalization, “In
some instances a person seen ﬂeeing from the scene of a violent crime is the person
who committed that crime.”
Wigmorean analysis provides a technique for identifying and making explicit the
generalizations involved at each step of an argument. At the same time, that analysis
maycumulativelyseemlikeaninvitationtoextremeskepticism.Itregularlyprovides
strong ammunition for attacking an opponent’s argument and for questioning one’s

ever be strong. However, after doing some exercises they usually conclude that it is
possibletoconstructcogentargumentsthatcanevensatisfythestandardof“beyond

A good lawyer must be able to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of
his or her own case as well as those of an opponent’s case. For present purposes
it is sufﬁcient to note that, in legal contexts, reliance upon generalizations that fall
far short of certainty is an inevitable aspect of even the strongest case. The com-
mon law model of adjudication assumes as much, and rarely will an argument be
of any value if it is limited to demonstrating that one’s opponent’s case falls short
of perfection. The skepticism of the disappointed perfectionist has little value in
a system that is explicitly based upon standards that require only less than perfect
proof. In litigation, the question is not “Is it certain?”, but rather, “Does it con-
form to the best available judgment that can be reached based upon the evidence
provided in light of the stock of knowledge and beliefs commonly held in the par-
ticular society at the time the case is tried?” In that context, Wigmorean analysis
simply provides analytic tools for identifying and analyzing background general-
izations. The capacity to use those tools effectively is an essential part of sound
lawyering.
3. Application of the principles in legal disputes
An offer of evidence always involves one (or more) of the probative processes Wig-
more described – assertion, explanation, rival, denial, or corroboration. But the
logical structure of the argument from evidential data to proposed conclusion will
differ in ways unrelated to the probative process being invoked. These structures
are important in two respects. First, they are central to questions on how speciﬁc
arguments, or the arguments in a case-as-a-whole, should be evaluated in reach-
ing a judgment. These are questions that Wigmore did not address in any detail.
They have become prominent in the current debate over the nature and role of
probabilistic reasoning in forensic contexts. Second, the structures have consider-
able practical importance for the lawyer who must analyze evidence to identify and
appraise the arguments that can be made in any case. We have largely deferred the
problems associated with evaluation and probabilistic reasoning to chapters 8 and
9 and the appendix on probability.34 But it is important to identify and explain
ﬁve central concepts and their signiﬁcance in analysis before proceeding – conjunc-
tion,compound (andcomplex)propositions,convergence,corroboration,andcatenate
inferences.
a. Conjunction. In order to succeed in a civil or a criminal case, a party may have
to establish each of several facts in issue or merely to establish one of a number of
facts in issue in the alternative. Thus, in a standard murder case, the prosecution
typically has to prove (A) that the victim is dead, (B) that the death was caused

Analysis of Evidence
by an actus reus, (C) that the accused committed the actus reus, and (D) that the
accused acted with criminal intent. Each of these is a necessary element in the
prosecution’s case. On the other hand, it is sufﬁcient for the defense to establish
reasonable doubt by undermining the probability of any of these penultimates or
by offering credible evidence in support of any one of a series of defenses, such
as (E) self-defense, (F) insanity, or (G) provocation. To put the matter formally, to
succeed in a typical murder case, the prosecution has to establish beyond reasonable
doubt that A and B and C and D are true, each of which is a necessary condition,
and it is sufﬁcient for the defense to show either that one of these conditions has not
been established beyond reasonable doubt or that defense E or F or G has not been
negated beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution. In a civil case, the ultimate
probandum may include alternative conditions, disjunctive penultimate probanda,
such that the proponent need only establish one of the alternatives in order to
recover – for example, that the equipment that caused the plaintiff’s injury was
either negligently designed or negligently manufactured.
In every case, a lawyer must ﬁrst determine, at least provisionally, the ultimate
probandum that must be established (or avoided). Thus, counsel for the plaintiff
in Sargent v Southern Accident Company (pages 28–31) would have identiﬁed that
she must ﬁnd evidence sufﬁcient to establish that it was more probable than not
that: (A) Upham Sargent is dead, and (B) he suffered an accidental injury, and
(C) the accidental injury was the sole cause of his death, and (D) he died within
90 days of the accidental injury, and (E) Upham Sargent was the insured under
a $500,000 insurance policy issued by the Southern Accident Company, and (F)
Porter Sargent is the sole beneﬁciary under that policy. Each of the component
propositions is, to some degree, analytically, but not statistically, independent of
theothersandmustbesupported,ataminimum,byevidencesufﬁcienttowithstand
a motion for a directed verdict. Parsing the ultimate probandum into its individual
elements is a necessary ﬁrst step in the analysis that a lawyer must perform in any
case.
b. Compound (or complex) propositions. Sometimes an intermediate probandum
may also contain a number of elements, each of which is supported by separate
evidence. In such instances, the question arises, how should one assess the strength
of the proposition as a whole? Although similar to conjunction, in legal contexts
different considerations apply to assessing the strength of compound propositions
that are intermediate probanda as opposed to assessing the strength of the ultimate
probandum for a case-as-a-whole.
Initially, the analytic task for the lawyer is to identify and to parse such inter-
mediate propositions into their component parts and to reduce each component
to a simple proposition. This task has two aspects. In the abstract, the task must
be performed in order to analyze with precision which evidence bears upon which
component, so that the support for each may be properly appraised. There is also a
strategicaspect.Howthecompoundpropositionandeachofitscomponentsshould
be framed typically is a function of strategy as well as logic. Logic speciﬁes neces-
sary, but rarely sufﬁcient, conditions that must be satisﬁed. For present purposes,

however, it is enough to note that the division of any compound or complex propo-
sition into its simplest constituent parts is necessary to sound analysis.35
The kind of analysis required in dealing with compound intermediate proposi-
tions ordinarily differs from that required to identify and separate the elements in
an ultimate probandum in ways that are signiﬁcant. Once the lawyer has identiﬁed
a potential ultimate probandum in a case, the task of subdividing it into its sepa-
rate elements and reducing them to simple propositions is primarily a task similar
to the task of parsing the holding in an appellate decision. Identifying compound
intermediate propositions that may be necessary or possible steps in an argument
requires more.
The distinction and its importance can be illustrated with the example developed
above (pages 94–98). In that example, the prosecution alleged,
3 It was X who committed the act that caused Y’s death,
and has offered evidence supporting two intermediate propositions:
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.
12 Y died in his home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1 as the result of an unlawful act
committed by another person.
Neither proposition 10 nor 12, standing alone, supports (or is even relevant to)
proposition 3. If they are combined to form the proposition “X was in Y’s house
at 4:30 p.m., and Y died in his home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1 as the result of an
unlawful act committed by another person,” the resulting compound proposition
supports proposition,
13 X had an opportunity to commit the act that caused Y’s death,
which in turn supports proposition 3.
Itisimportantthatlawyersrecognizethepartsofanargumentwheresuchcombi-
nations are necessary because doubts about proposition 10 and about proposition
12 must, in some manner, combine to increase the doubt about proposition 13.
Putting aside questions concerning how such doubts should be combined in reach-
ing a judgment about that proposition, it is clear that the presence of independent
sources of doubt creates possibilities for effective argument that no lawyer should
overlook. This requires careful analysis.36

until we turn explicitly to problems of evaluation in Chs. 8 and 9. As used here, complex propo-
sitions are compound propositions in which the truth or falsity of each component element is
independent of the truth or falsity of the others.
36 The difﬁculty of the analytic task is enhanced by the fact that the presence of a compound proposi-
tion in argument is often concealed (intentionally or unintentionally) by the language commonly
used in argumentation. The prosecutor, for example, might argue, “The evidence shows that X was
in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m., when the murder occurred.” Counsel for the defense must have foreseen
the likely argument and have identiﬁed that it involves the combination of two simple propositions
in order to plan a response that effectively illustrates the need to consider and combine any doubts
that exist as to each of the component propositions. See also note 38 below (for an illustration of
how the seemingly simple proposition, “Y was murdered in his house at 4:30 p.m.,” might usefully
be divided into three further simple propositions).

Analysis of Evidence
Propositions developed through investigations are often complex propositions.
For example, based upon proposition 4 in “An investigation,” the prosecutor can
anticipate that W2 would testify,
28 W2: I saw X, whom I know, running out of Y’s home at 4:45 p.m. on January 1.
This testimonial assertion needs to be broken down into three component propo-
sitions because each is relevant for a different reason.
29 W2: I know X (relevant to credibility of identiﬁcation).
16 W2: I saw X leave Y’s home at 4:45 p.m. on January 1 (relevant to presence in home at
4:45 p.m. and thus to opportunity).
30 W2: X was running when he left Y’s home at 4:45 p.m. on January 1 (relevant to
ﬂight).
The importance of this kind of analysis should be clear.
c. Convergence. A logician provided a useful deﬁnition of convergence: “Two
items of circumstantial evidence converge when both facts, independently of the
other, [support the] probability [of] the same conclusion.”37 For example, consider
two propositions:
9 It was X who entered Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1, and
17 X departed from Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. on January 1.
Either proposition, if accepted as true, would support the inference,
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.
The two converge to strengthen this inference.
Again putting aside questions concerning the degree of additional strength pro-
vided when two propositions converge, it should be clear that convergence raises
analytical issues, in addition to credibility, that are different from those raised by
testimonial corroboration. In the illustration, the lawyer may and should examine
possible explanations unrelated to the credibility of the witnesses – for instance,
32 X may have left Y’s house before 4:30 p.m. to run an errand and returned sometime
after 4:30 p.m. and before 4:45 p.m.
It is also important to note that an argument that is strengthened because two
propositions converge to support a third is an argument that can never be strength-
ened and must ordinarily be weakened because two propositions combine to form
a compound proposition that is a necessary step in the arguments in a case. For
example, if accepted as true, propositions 6 and 16, and the assertions made by W1
and W2, support inferences that converge to strengthen proposition 10, “X was in Y’s
house at 4:30 p.m. on January 1.” That proposition combines with the proposition
12, “Y died in his home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1 as the result of an unlawful act

committedbyanotherperson,”tosupportproposition13,“Xhadanopportunityto
commit the act that caused Y’s death,” which provides a necessary step in the pros-
ecution’s argument that the evidence establishes X’s guilt. The resulting compound
proposition, can, however, be no stronger than its constituent parts and must, in
some sense, be weaker where the evidence leaves ground for doubt about each of
the parts.38
d. Corroboration. The same logician considering the concept in the context of
judicial disputes gave it a narrower meaning that, for present purposes, is useful:
“At its simplest testimonial corroboration occurs when two witnesses both testify,
independently of one another, to the truth of the same proposition.”39 For example,
if a new witness, W6, testiﬁed,
31 W6: I also saw a person with characteristics a, b, c, and d enter Y’s house at 4:15 p.m.
on January 1,
that would corroborate W1’s testimony,
5 “I saw a person with characteristics a, b, c, and d enter Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on
January 1,”
and, in some degree, strengthens the inference,
6 A person with characteristics a, b, c, and d entered Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1.
It is important to recognize the distinction between convergence in general and
corroboration in particular. Corroboration in this narrow sense focuses the analysis
oncredibility.Thelawyerwhowishestochallengeaproponent’sassertionsupported
by the independent testimony of two witnesses must begin by examining possible
sources of error that may diminish the credibility of either or both witnesses – such
as that the conditions under which the observation took place were not suitable for
accurate perception (lighting, distance, eyesight, etc.); the witness’s memory is not
reliable (lapse of time, reliability of the witness with respect to other events, etc.);
or the witness has a motive to lie (animosity toward X, fear of prosecution, etc.).
By limiting corroboration to this narrower meaning, the starting-point for analysis
is clariﬁed. That limitation also makes it possible to maintain an analytically useful
distinction between corroboration and convergence.
e. Catenate inferences. Catenate inferences are “chains” of inferences, a condition
that exists when there is more than one step in the reasoning necessary to show
38 In theory, the strength of a compound proposition can never be greater than the strength of the
weakest of its constituent parts. If I am absolutely certain that Y was murdered in his house at
4:30 p.m., but I think it only slightly more probable than not that X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.,
I can at most conclude that the compound proposition is slightly more probable than not. If I
also have doubt about (i) whether Y was, in fact, murdered, or (ii) whether his death occurred
in the house, or (iii) whether the time of death was 4:30 p.m., my doubts must in some manner
combine to diminish the degree of certainty with which I could accept the compound proposition
as proven. We address problems of this kind in Chs. 8 and 9 and the appendix on probability.

Analysis of Evidence
the relationship by which a probans supports a probandum. An argument from an
autoptic proference to a fact of consequence almost invariably involves (and can
always be restated to involve) catenate rather than simple inferences. For example,
the ﬁrst step in any inferential chain from a testimonial assertion must always be
the truth of the matter asserted – e.g., from the fact that W2 testiﬁed,
16 W2: I saw X leave Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. on January 1,
we infer that,
17 X departed from Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. on January 1,
and then infer that,
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m on January 1.
Two points follow from this that should be noted. First, sound analysis requires
that the lawyer identify and articulate each step in the chain of inferences necessary
to reason from an autoptic proference to a fact of consequence. The step omitted
is the possible source of doubt not identiﬁed, the “weak link” unseen, the possible
point of attack unnoted. Second, creativity and judgment are required in analyzing
and articulating the steps in an inferential chain. The best practical guide in this
context is that the lawyer should seek to identify every condition that may give
reason for doubt about the claim that probans A supports probandum B. Each
ground that raises a plausible basis for doubt indicates that there is a necessary step
in the inferential chain that should be examined.
f. Combining Evidentiary Propositions: Integration. Most factual arguments
involve the use of different logical structures – inferences that are corroborative,
convergent, or catenate, or the product of a combination of two (or more) simple
propositions – in demonstrating the proposed relationships between discrete evi-
dential data and the probandum urged. As a practical matter it is important to be
able to recognize the distinctions and their signiﬁcance.
The simple inference from each testimonial assertion to the truth of the fact
asserted focuses attention on credibility as the most signiﬁcant source of possible
doubt. The presence of two or more testimonial assertions that are corroborative
may diminish the likelihood that credibility can be plausibly attacked (perhaps to
a point where further explorations are not justiﬁed), but it cannot eliminate it.
Where two circumstantial propositions converge to strengthen a third, the lawyer
must consider possible explanations unrelated to credibility and possible sources of
evidence that might support one of these explanations or support a rival inference.
Where two propositions combine to support a further inference, the lawyer must
recognize that the support cannot be stronger than the weaker of the two and must
look for further possibilities that may explain or rival the proposed probandum –
for instance, that X was present in the house at the time of the murder, but a
third party intruder, acting independently, was the person who committed the act
that caused Y’s death. She should focus her investigations accordingly. The fact

that multiple steps are required in an argument from evidential data to proposed
conclusion signals the need for further investigation before the case is tried and
makes it possible to identify and eliminate or cumulate sources of doubt that can
be used in argument at trial.
Those distinctions make it possible to frame more clearly some issues of con-
siderable importance – namely, questions about how doubt at each stage of an
argument should be considered in reaching a judgment whether a probandum has
been proven to the required degree of certainty. If there is any ground to doubt
credibility of W1 (proposition 5) or W6 (proposition 31) or their ability to identify
accurately the characteristics of the person they say they saw enter Y’s house at
4:15 p.m. in the circumstances present, there must be some ground to doubt the
inferences they support, that a person who had the same characteristics as X entered
at 4:15 p.m. Assuming there is some doubt, how should these doubts and the addi-
tional doubt created by limiting qualiﬁcations on the generalization, proposition
11, “People who enter a house usually remain for more than ﬁfteen minutes,” affect
the assessment of the likelihood that proposition 10, “X was in Y’s house at 4:30
p.m.,” is true? How then should those doubts be combined with any doubts about
the time, place, or cause of Y’s death in evaluating the strength of the inference that
Y had an opportunity to commit the act that caused Y’s death and how can they be
accumulated in reaching a judgment about the penultimate probandum, “It was X
who murdered Y”?
These are important questions. They have been the subject of extensive (and
sometimes heated) debate among scholars holding different theories of probability.
They are obviously signiﬁcant to a lawyer in a criminal case who must argue to a
jury that ultimate probandum in that case has or has not been proved “beyond a
reasonable doubt.” Those questions are addressed in Chapters 8 and 9.
The chart and other methods of analysis presented in this book do not address
these questions. The principles of proof developed in this chapter and the chart
method of analysis presented in the next chapter can be used and applied to any
case because they are independent of any of the contending theories of probability.
With a few adjustments, probability theorists from any of the schools may use
the principles and the method to analyze and organize the evidence in a case in a
manner that facilitates the development of their ideas on how the particular parts
and the whole should be evaluated. As a practical matter, the principles and the
methods Wigmore presented, as reﬁned and developed here, can readily be adapted
to facilitate the analysis, construction, and appraisal of arguments about disputed
questions of fact that are the concern of the analyst.
