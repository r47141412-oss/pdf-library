Analysis of Evidence
established by testimonial assertions and real evidence admitted at trial, presented
in a narrative form that hopefully compels the conclusion that the ultimate
probandum has been proved or not proved. Each assertion is typically indexed to the
witness(es) or exhibits from which the evidential data will be drawn. The function of
the statement is to provide a touchstone of relevance in planning and conducting the
trial; not a comprehensive regurgitation of the evidence, but also not so abstract a
compilation that neither theory nor theme is clear.
c The law. The summary articulation of the law the lawyer expects the court to apply or
instruct the trier-of-fact to apply to the facts. Here again, the focus is upon the
lawyer’s theory of this case, not simply a persuasive regurgitation of the law for all
possible theories or a summary of the jury instructions. Typically, both parties in their
pleadings have articulated a variety of theories of liability and defense. If pre-trial
preparation has not eliminated or ordered the signiﬁcance of most of those theories,
the lawyer’s job has not been done. Here the lawyer is setting out his or her considered
judgment as to what will constitute the law of this case – the legal assumptions against
which the trial is to be organized and presented.
d Strategy, problems, and solutions. The theory, story, theme, facts, and law have been
organized, not only in light of what the lawyer has to work with, but also in
anticipation of what opposing counsel has and how she can and will use it. Here
counsel presents the major strategic judgments made, the critical challenges
anticipated, the possible solutions identiﬁed, and the fall-back positions selected. For
example, in the prosecution of Archer for the murder of Vern, if the prosecution has
determined that Archer stood to inherit considerable wealth as a result of Vern’s
death, that fact plus the scrap of cloth and the jacket may be the central facts in the
prosecution’s theory and theme. (Review the facts in State v. Archer [III],
pages 142–44.) If the defense counsel has determined that evidence is available to
suggest that Baker believed he had been cheated when Vern broke their partnership or
that Carl thought Vern caused his sister to commit suicide by breaking off the
engagement, those facts plus the Tuesday visit may be central to the defense theory
and theme. The admissibility of the evidence supporting these inferences on either
side may be open to challenge, in which event the entire strategy of each side might
hinge upon how the court will rule on these admissibility questions. Here, counsel
would identify the problems, how each is to be resolved, and, where necessary, what
the best fall-back position would be.
In sum, the preliminary memorandum presents the lawyer’s best judgment on
how the case can and should be presented. Prior to trial, it constitutes his or her
touchstone in organizing the other components of the trial: Is this testimony consis-
tent with the theory, story, and theme? Consistent with the strategy? Is it necessary?
What function does it serve? During the trial, it is the ready reference that enables
the lawyer to revisualize the forest after a day of cutting trees and wandering down
unexpected paths. How do I get back on the main path tomorrow?
2. The trial components. The trial lawyer will have outlines and checklists for
every component of the trial, typically organized in the sequence they will be used.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
321
The following notes describe the kinds of materials that might be included in each
segment of a trial book and how the pre-trial devices might be used in developing
them.
a Jury selection. If the case is tried to a jury in the United States, each lawyer will need a
checklist, charts, and questions to guide him or her in jury selection. The
development of the materials will depend upon the particular jurisdiction’s and
judge’s (i) rules and attitudes about the function and scope of voir dire questioning
and about the lawyer’s role in the process and (ii) procedure for exercising challenges.
Given these, the lawyer must make judgments about the characteristics and
backgrounds of the “best” and “worst” kinds of jurors for the particular case. The
lawyer wants jurors who will understand the theory, respond to the themes, and be
governed by the generalizations upon which both depend. The lawyer’s judgments on
prospective jurors may be guided by scientiﬁc inquiry, past experience, or biases and
“lore” (lawyers’ generalizations). Of course, while the manifest function of voir dire is
to select a jury, it is often used in practice to serve other functions, such as to educate
or establish rapport with the potential jurors.
b Preliminary matters. In almost all complex cases and in some jurisdictions, all
pre-trial motions and other matters are resolved before the trial begins. In some
jurisdictions, counsel may make pre-trial motions and address “housekeeping”
matters – e.g., to invoke the rule excluding witnesses from the courtroom until they
have testiﬁed or to ask how freely may counsel move about the courtroom – before
opening statements. Indeed, where permitted counsel may wish not to disclose her
position on some issues until the last possible moment for strategic reasons. Often,
such motions seek to resolve an evidentiary issue where counsel does not want her
opponent to mention the evidence in opening statement – e.g., motions to exclude
evidence of a prior crime or bad act under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of
Evidence. This section of the trial book would identify the matters to be addressed or
that may be raised by opposing counsel before opening statements and would include
summaries of the arguments to be made and the supporting authorities and, to the
extent possible, opposing authorities counsel may have to address.
c The opening statement. There are many views about the signiﬁcance of an opening
statement and what it should include. But its content is ordinarily a function of two
variables: the central facts (as identiﬁed in the preliminary memorandum) and the
lawyer’s strategy. Rarely would a lawyer include facts not identiﬁed as central to her
theory of the case; often strategy will dictate holding back some of these. The object is
to present the facts necessary to understand the theory of the case and to establish the
central themes to be developed, but it may be necessary to avoid areas where counsel
is uncertain how the trial will develop.9 But ordinarily the opening is where the
foundation for theory and theme are established. Within the limits imposed by
9 At the extreme are those occasional criminal defenses where the nature of the defense depends
largely upon how the prosecution develops its case or where counsel is seeking to keep the defense
cards concealed. There the defense opening may be little more than a peroration calling upon the
jurors to keep open minds and reminding them that the burden is on the government to prove its
case beyond any reasonable doubt and that the defendant need not even take the stand.

Analysis of Evidence
strategic and ethical considerations, the opening statement is also when the lawyer
tells the story and establishes the themes she expects to develop through presentation
of evidential data and to emphasize in closing argument. Its structure and delivery are
functions of these objectives, plus rhetorical and communication considerations. In
addition, the opening statement ordinarily lays out the program and storyline for the
“play” to follow; for example, who will be witnesses and what they will contribute.
The trial book will, at a minimum, include a checklist of points to be covered and an
outline for counsel’s speech.
d The Evidence. The evidence sections of the trial book ordinarily follow the order in
which witnesses and exhibits will (or in which counsel anticipates they will) be called
or used.
i The opening party (plaintiff or prosecution) will typically have for each witness:
a A statement of objectives to be achieved through this witness and a checklist.
(What components of the theory must be established through this witness?
Which evidential assertions on the key-list must be adduced here? How can this
witness contribute to establishing the planned themes?)
b A “script” of proposed questions and anticipated responses or, more likely, an
outline of the testimony to be elicited from each witness, organized to bring out
the central points in a dramatically effective way and structured to place
emphasis on the propositions essential to the theory in a manner that develops
the themes,10 including questions sufﬁcient to establish the necessary
foundation for each exhibit to be introduced through that witness.
c Copies (or abstracts) of any documents or other real evidence to be introduced,
identiﬁed, or used through the witness.
d A set of notes addressing various objections or other points of law likely to arise
with references to cases or other authorities that counsel will use or anticipate
her opponent will use with reference to the folder containing copies of those
cases.
e Copies (or abstracts) of any prior statements or transcripts of depositions that
the witness gave at an earlier time.
ii Opposing counsel’s trial book will contain for each of those witnesses:
a A statement of counter-objectives. (Is the witness to be discredited? Can this
witness be compelled to make assertions that are on the defense key-list or that
will place the testimony on direct in a different context? And so on.)
b A “script” of questions for anticipated cross-examinations or, more likely, a
point outline indicating the lines of questioning that may be developed.
10 Few experienced lawyers “script” the anticipated dialogue. For that reason and because “scripting”
may raise serious ethical concerns, many trial practice teachers do not require it and some do not
permit it. In the context of teaching the art of questioning, however, scripting can be a valuable
exercise for students because the art of direct examination is far more difﬁcult than most young
lawyers perceive. To present a dramatically effective and coherent conversation without using
leading questions while assuring that the proper foundations are laid to establish the competence
of the witness does not come naturally. Anderson and others teaching practice skills have found
that the development of the necessary skills is accelerated if a proposed “script” is actually written
out in advance of the examination and is available for pre- or post-performance critique.

c Documents or exhibits that the witness may be called upon to identify or that
may, if permitted, be introduced during cross-examination.
d Law notes for objections, with references to authorities.
e Prior statements or deposition transcripts that may be used to refresh the
witness’s recollection or impeach his or her credibility.
iii For the defense case, the sections of the trial book are the same, but the roles are
reversed. Counsel for the defense are concerned with direct examination of
witnesses and introducing exhibits; counsel for the plaintiff or the government are
concerned with cross examination of witnesses and blocking.
iv The roles again shift for any rebuttal. The notes and copies for planned motions,
stipulations, and other problems are interspersed appropriately.
Interspersed in the witness-by-witness sections, the trial book will ordinarily contain
copies of documents to be admitted and published and facts to be introduced by
stipulation or by judicial notice with appropriate notes on the objectives to be
achieved and the legal problems to be confronted in each instance. Finally, both
sides will have outlines for motions to be made (or anticipated) at the close of
the plaintiff’s or prosecution’s case (or at earlier stages) with supporting
authorities.
e The closing statement. For the trial book, an abstract and a speaking outline: But
here the theory, theme, and law must be interwoven; the plausible story told. Based
upon the evidential propositions established and the lawyer’s assessment of the best
theory and theme now available, the closing argument is developed. The analysis
developed in the Wigmorean chart and developed as the outline for the plausible
story must, at the close of trial, be adjusted (mentally) for surprises that occurred
during the trial. The task is translating the analysis into a persuasive story and
argument.
f Miscellaneous. Every trial book will also contain other materials that may be necessary,
but will not be presented at trial – e.g., (i) a checklist of exhibits with space to record
whether each was identiﬁed, admitted (with or without objection), or rejected (and
on what basis); (ii) a master checklist to keep track of all the evidence to be introduced
or opposed to assure that the essential data have been included; (iii) copies of any
pre-trial papers that may be necessary at trial; (iv) the pleadings or pre-trial order, as
a touchstone for relevance; the admissions, as the basis for introducing facts without
testimony; (v) the objections or other law problems the court ruled upon before
trial; and (vi) the jury instructions tendered (or to be tendered), approved, and
rejected.
3. The trial book: an art form
Master chronologies, diagrams, key-lists, and charts are all devices for organizing
and analyzing the available data. The skills required to prepare each go beyond the
mechanical, beyond the logical analysis; art and judgment are required for each. So
too, the trial book. The trial book should be a central organizational and analytical
device.Itistheﬁnalpre-trialvehiclethroughwhichthelawyerputsthecasetogether.

Analysis of Evidence
During the trial, it constitutes the lawyer’s “bible.” But a trial is more than a mere
presentation of facts and legal principles; judges and juries are neither computers
nor logicians. The trial is an art form.
The dramatic play and the theater provide useful artistic metaphors for the
trial and courtroom. In this metaphor, the trial book is the producer-director’s
masterproductionbook.Thelawyer’srolesareawesome.Sheistheeditor-producer-
director.Thefactsavailabletoeachplayermustbeeditedandorganizedfordramatic
effect as well as logical relevance. The actors must be rehearsed or prepared. The
sequence in which each will appear and in which the story is to unfold must be
planned and determined. The conventions of the “theater” must be analyzed to
determine how to protect and enhance the one play and restrict and limit the
options available to the other. All this must be planned before trial. During the
trial, the lawyers take on additional roles as stage managers and major actors. And
only rarely is there an opportunity to test the production on the road – the ﬁrst
performance is typically the last. Two plays are competing on the same stage for
one audience. One play (deserved or not) will get rave reviews; the other will be
consigned to oblivion.11
The metaphor can be carried too far. The conventions are ethical as well as
legal. The system depends on the players observing established norms of con-
duct whose violation might not be noticed by the judge-critic, but on whose exis-
tence the entire system relies. But even so limited, the metaphor illustrates the art
required in preparing the trial book and presenting the evidence and argument at
trial.
The trial book is central. It identiﬁes the theory, story, and themes to be
developed at trial and the plan for their development. It creates and deﬁnes the
sequence in which witnesses and other evidence will be presented to maximize their
dramatic effect in relation to the theory, story, and themes chosen. But it also estab-
lishesthedetail:planning,sometimesscripting,thedialogue(witnessexamination);
outlining, sometimes scripting, counsel’s soliloquies (opening and closing); iden-
tifying the physical exhibits (a scrap of cloth, a coat, a wheelchair, a map, a model,
etc.); and specifying the manner in which each will be presented and used. The more
complete the book, the less the stage manager has to carry in her head during the
trial.
And it should be clear that during the trial, the lawyer as actor, producer, and
stage manager will have enough to do and is likely to lose the theory and theme and
fail to present the story unless the production book is at hand and is a competent
work of art as well as a complete reﬂection of the mechanics. Logical analysis and
organization are always necessary conditions; never sufﬁcient.
11 The metaphor should not for a moment obscure ethical responsibility of the lawyer. Not only
is the trial a play with real consequences in terms of just and unjust outcomes, but also at every
stage the lawyer must remember that the law and the profession impose obligations intended to
advance the ascertainment of truth. Nonetheless, with that admonition, the dramatic metaphor
is useful.

B. Two simple cases
1. Suggested format
Two mini-trial problems that are the basis of this exercise were developed for use
in the Inns of Court School of Law in London for training would-be barristers.
They take the form of a modiﬁed solicitor’s brief to a barrister. They also represent
compact exercises by which the course-to-date can be put together.
The problems are designed so that, where appropriate, a class can be divided into
two-person law ﬁrms, for example, Law Firms A, B, C, and D. In an eight-person
exercise, the Law Firms would be paired in the following manner. Law Firms B and
D would represent the prosecution (or supply the prosecution witness); Law Firms
A and C would represent the defendant (or supply the defense witness). The trial
pairings would thus be:
Police v. Weller
Police
v.
Weller
Counsel Firm:
B
C
Witness Firm:
A
D
Police v. Twist
Police
v.
Twist
Counsel Firm:
D
A
Witness Firm:
C
B
The full exercise would have three parts:
1 Each ﬁrm would prepare a complete key-list and chart for the case it is to present.
2 Each ﬁrm would prepare a trial book.12 An entire trial book should be less than ten
typewritten pages doublespaced.
3 Each case would be tried using the following rules:
a Time allowances: (i) opening statements – two minutes each; (ii) direct and
redirect – ﬁve minutes per witness; (iii) cross – three minutes per witness;
(iv) closings – ﬁve minutes each. (The total time consumed by each trial should not
exceed 30 minutes.)
b Division of responsibility: One member of each ﬁrm would open and conduct the
cross-examination of the opposing side’s witness; the other would conduct the
direct and will close.
c The law: The statutes deﬁning the alleged offenses are set out at the end of the two
problems. Students should assume the law governing trafﬁc offenses and
negligence is otherwise the same as that in their jurisdiction. Students outside the
United Kingdom should remember that the law in England requires drivers to
drive in the left lane and that the “near side” is the passenger side on the left, and
the offside is the driver’s side on the right.
The trial can be conducted as a jury trial in the United States or before a
bench of magistrates in England and Wales. The non-participating members of

Counsel has herewith:
1. Statement of P.C. 21X Heep.
2. Police Plan
The Defendant is charged with (a) driving without due care and attention contrary
to section 3 of the Road Trafﬁc Act of 1972 and (b) failing to comply with a trafﬁc
signal (give way sign) contrary to section 22 of the Road Trafﬁc Act 1972. The
Defendant has the following previous convictions:

Counsel is instructed accordingly.
P.C. 21X Heep will say:13
At 12.05 hours on December 28 last I was standing on the corner of Acacia Drive
South and Sussex Road in North Woodford. Sussex Road is the major road, and
there are “give way” signs 15 yards from the junction of Acacia Drive South and
North and Sussex Road. There are markings on the road surface at the junction.
I saw a Singer Gazelle motor car being driven along Acacia Road North towards
the junction. I estimated its speed to be 30 m.p.h. The driver made no attempt to
slow down until he was about 8 feet from the junction when he appeared to brake
heavily. The vehicle stopped with the front about 8 feet onto the north carriageway
of Sussex Road. A Jaguar motor car travelling east on Sussex Road was forced to
swerve violently to its offside in order to avoid the Singer. I went over to the driver
of the Singer who identiﬁed himself to be Samuel Weller aged 19, of 24 Marine

careless driving and failing to obey a trafﬁc sign. At the time of the incident the sun
was shining, but the road surface was wet from recent rain. Counsel should assume
that this is a statement made by Ofﬁcer Heep.

say:
On Sunday, December 28, last,14 I was driving in my Singer Gazelle motor
car on my way home from Epping where I had stayed the previous night with
friends. At Woodford I lost my way and found myself driving through side roads.
This was about midday. It had been raining but had stopped and the sun had
come out. The roads were wet. At one time I was driving due south – the sun
was low in the sky and was being reﬂected off the road surface so that it was
difﬁcult to see ahead. When I reached the junction of Sussex Road and Acacia
Drive, I did not notice the cross roads ahead – it seemed to me that the road
went straight ahead. I was travelling about 25 m.p.h. When I was about 20 yards
from Sussex Road, I noticed the road and braked heavily. I stopped at the line,
although my bumper may have been over the line. A car went by from my right
at that stage, and swerved. That was an unnecessary action because my car pre-
sented no obstacle or danger. I did not notice the give way sign or the markings
on the road, but I was half blinded by driving into the sun. A police ofﬁcer who
apparently had been standing at the corner, came over and told me I would be
reported for reckless driving. I told him I had been blinded by the dazzle from the
road.
I have two endorsements within the last year:

Yeading Lane. At the same time the defendant Oliver Twist was driving his Austin
1100 YMP 100A north along Yeading Lane towards the junction. There is a stop sign
and a double line on Yeading Lane. He failed to stop at the double white line and a
collision took place between the front offside of the Austin and the front nearside of
the police car. There are no other witnesses. Visibility from the centre of the mouth
of Yeading Lane east in the direction of Ealing is 60 yards.
On 8th December, I was driving police car PVR 207E west along Boundary Road,
Hayes in Middlesex on an emergency call. As I approached the junction of Yeading
Lane (which was to my left) an Austin 1100 motor car YMP 100A suddenly drove
into my path. I applied my brakes, skidded and stopped 60 yards from the junction
on the wrong side of the road. Damage to my vehicle was to the front nearside,
with scrape mark along the whole nearside. I returned to the scene of the accident
where 1 saw Oliver Twist (aged 21). He agreed he was the driver of the vehicle which
collided with my car. I cautioned him and he said “I’m sorry. I never saw you.”
Damage to his car was to the front offside. I noticed the rear offside tyre was bald.
Notice of intended prosecution was sent to the Defendant by recorded post on 20th
December. I have since returned to the scene to check the relevant distances.
Twist has 2 previous convictions:

occurred. Instructing solicitors understand that the visibility from the centre of the
mouth of Yeading Lane east in the direction of Ealing is 60 yards. Counsel is asked
to appear for the Defendant.
Oliver Twist of 203 Uxbridge Road, Ealing, W5 will say:
I am aged 21 and work at the Ace Motors Garage in Ealing as a salesman. It
is essential for my job that I keep my licence. On 8th December I drove along
Yeading Lane to the junction with Boundary Road. I was going home from a party
at the garage. The weather was bad – pouring rain. The sun had set and it was
dark. I stopped at the junction but could not see clearly to my right. The view
was obscured by (a) a large tree and (b) a bend in the road. I began to edge care-
fully out looking both ways. Suddenly a police car came tearing from my right
and hit me. I saw the police car before it hit me and I had stopped. I was half
out in the nearside lane of Boundary Road when the collision occurred. I don’t
remember what the policewoman said, but she was very annoyed and discourte-
ous. She told me she was going to throw the book at me when I tried to explain
what happened. She scrutinised my car and found that the offside rear tyre was
bald.
I admit the tyre is bald. I do not admit I was guilty of any other summonses
and I wish to plead NOT GUILTY to all the others. I did not receive the notice of
intended prosecution until the day after Boxing Day. I do not remember the police
ofﬁcer giving me verbal notice of intended prosecution.
I have two previous convictions for driving offences:
21 December (two years prior to event)
Ealing Magistrates Court. Excess Speed
£10 L.E. (Licence endorsed)
15th July (one year prior to event)
Harrow Magistrates Court. Excess Speed
£25 L.E.

(1) Where a constable is for the time being engaged in the regulation of trafﬁc in
a road, or where a trafﬁc sign, being a sign of the prescribed size, colour and type,
or of another character authorized by the Secretary of State under the provisions in
that behalf of the Road Trafﬁc Regulation Act of 1967, has been lawfully placed on
or near a road, a person driving or propelling a vehicle who –
(a) neglects or refuses to stop the vehicle or to make it proceed in, or keep to, a

C. The art of plausible proof: theory, story, and theme revisited
1. Introduction
1. Some questions. What are the central facts in dispute in Weller? Is it possible
to develop a theory which, if accepted, would compel both the conclusion (a) that
Weller was not driving without due care and attention, and the conclusion (b)

Analysis of Evidence
that Weller did not fail to comply with the give way sign? From the standpoint of
counsel for the prosecution, if the court had directed you to proceed on only one
of the charges which would you have chosen? Would counsel for defense have been
pleased by your decision? Are the same disputed facts central to both charges? What
difference would it have made if either the events had occurred on July 28 or they
had occurred in Nairobi, Kenya? These are questions that can be answered only by
analysis. In the context of Weller, the analysis necessary to respond requires creative
analysis, abductive as well as inductive reasoning.
Analysis of the evidence in Twist should have yielded similar questions with one
exception. Presumably, the analysis would not be as dramatically affected had the
events occurred in July or in Nairobi. An analysis of Twist is likely to lead counsel
to focus more attention on evidence that bears upon the credibility of the two
witnesses than was appropriate in Weller. Why? Again these are questions that fall
primarilywithinthedomainofanalysis.Acomparisonbetweenthekindsofanalysis
needed in Twist with that needed in Weller should make it clear that technical skill
and deﬁned protocols provide necessary tools but do not eliminate the need for
creativity and judgment.
Analysis that identiﬁed and yielded answers to questions such as those posed
above should have enabled counsel to deﬁne the plausible theories available for each
side in either case. Those theories in turn may have suggested, but did not dictate,
thewayinwhichtheevidentialdataandargumentscouldbepresentedtodevelopan
effective story consistent with the theory chosen. Does the story that either counsel
in Weller might properly have chosen have as strong or dramatic a plot as the stories
that might appropriately have been developed in Twist? Did you anticipate that the
story presented by counsel for the police was likely to be signiﬁcantly different from
that developed by counsel for Weller? How similar did you expect the competing
stories to be in the trial of Police v. Twist ?
The choice of a theory and a story in the two cases also illustrates the importance
of theme. Does counsel for Weller have to attack the conduct and motives of Ofﬁcer
Heep in any signiﬁcant way? Did the record provide material suggesting that such
an attack could have been successfully mounted? Would the attack have been con-
sistent with a sound defense theory or story? What were the appropriate themes in
Weller? Contrast your responses to these questions with the responses you would
give concerning the themes that counsel for Twist should try to establish in the
cross-examination of Ofﬁcer Abbott and should emphasize in opening and closing
arguments. If you participated in the full exercise, review your own performance
and those of your colleagues in light of your responses. How would you do the job
differently next time?
2. Some notes. The materials that follow illustrate theories and stories that might
have played an important role in famous (or in one instance ﬁctional) trials. For the
most part, these materials are more interesting as literature than prose in presenting
principles of proof and methods of analysis. As you read each, however, ask yourself

how extensive and detailed an analysis of the evidence would have been necessary
to enable a lawyer to select and develop themes and stories for cases in which real
interests of real parties were at stake.
2. More food for thought
a. K. Llewellyn: Who are these men?15
Who are the two men whose names recur, whose lives and honor are the immediate
stake in all this story?
Nicola Sacco, an Italian, resident in Massachusetts from his eighteenth year. A
solid workman, who learned his trade outside of hours, a shoeworker, a “good
cobbler” and “edger.” A simple-hearted devoted husband and father. A lover of
nature – who in prison found difﬁculty writing to his friends unless blue sky heart-
ened and cheered him through the bars. An idealist, bent on improving the lot of
working-men, so strong, so unafraid in his convictions that on trial for his life,
before a jury whom he knew to be prejudiced against such views, he preached his
beliefs, prepared to be a martyr to his faith.
Nicola Sacco (the same Nicola Sacco?), a foreigner discontented with our insti-
tutions, yet content to abide among them. One who forsook all decent views for
Socialism, even for Anarchism. Living and earning here, yet ﬂeeing to Mexico in fear
of being drafted to defend the country. The user of a false name. A man who would
lie lightly to his employer to cover up a morning on leave that he had spent in talk
and not on business. A gun-toter. An agitator. A man too indifferent to American
ways to seek during 12 years of freedom to learn English decently, too stupid to
learn English decently during seven years in jail. An associate of that Vanzetti whom
we know to have been convicted of an attempted holdup in Bridgewater.
Bartolomeo Vanzetti, a man who had forsaken his home in Italy and a good living
with a farmer-family whom he loved, because his conscience would not let him be a
party to exploiting men. A man who, though without wife and children, astonished
his neighbors by his steadiness and effort at his work. A man who, ready to throw
himself into the place of danger in defense of his fellows, was chosen to go up to New
York to discuss the further defense of Salsedo, a radical held incommunicado by
the Federal authorities in their wild deportation drive of 1920; that Salsedo whose
“questioning” is suspected of having driven him to seek relief in suicide. Vanzetti,
a man whom person after person, of judgment, insight, and sensibility, learned to
know after the time of his imprisonment; and whom each of those who learned to
know him came to honor, respect, admire, even love. A man framed up before the
15 Llewellyn (1962) Ch. 20. This was originally prepared as part of an unpublished study of the Sacco-
Vanzetti case. The present portion has been published in Michael and Wechsler (1940) 1085, and
in Joughin and Morgan (1948). The Michael and Wechsler notes [hereinafter designated “Michael
& Wechsler”] have been retained. See Commonwealth v. Sacco, 255 Mass. 369, 151 N.E. 839 (1926),
259 Mass. 128, 156 N.E. 57 (1927), 261 Mass. 12, 158 N.E. 167 (1927). The full record of all the
proceedings has been published as The Sacco-Vanzetti Case (1929). For discussions of the case, see
Frankfurter (1927); Kadane and Schum (1996).

Analysis of Evidence
present trial (on a charge made against Sacco, too, until for Sacco an unshakable
alibi was proved) in order to make easy the conviction in the case in hand.
Bartolomeo Vanzetti (the same Bartolomeo Vanzetti?), a radical leader, a speech-
maker, an anarchistic agitator; closely concerned with that Salsedo who was dan-
gerous enough to induce the Federal authorities to hold him incommunicado till,
seemingly, he confessed his guilt by suicide. A guntoter, Vanzetti, as well. A man
convicted previously of another desperate crime of violence. A man the more dan-
gerous because of his brains and gift of leadership. A draft-dodger. A liar, who
lied copiously and confessedly on his arrest. A believer in violence. An associate,
a sympathizer, a “comrade” of those radicals who threatened and even exercised
outrageous violence in efforts to terrify the authorities into giving him up without
punishment.
Opinions differ, you may observe, about these two. Two things are certain: they
were Italians and radicals; they were accused of murder.
From one angle, it makes no difference which of these two views of these two
Italians you accept. Angel or devil, a man has a claim to a fair trial of his guilt. Angel
or devil, he has a claim to a fair trial, not of his general social desirability, but of his
guilt of the speciﬁc offense charged against him. Such is the letter of our law.
b. Bywaters and Thompson: Who is this woman?
What kind of person is Edith Thompson? She pictures herself as a great romantic
lover, as someone who is prepared to risk anything “for a great big love like ours.”
But she is deceiving herself as she deceived others: just as again and again she lied to
her husband, to her family, to the police, even to her lover, so more often than not
she deluded herself. Consider her ﬁrst as a wife and as a lover: She did not marry
for love; when did she show affection or sympathy or mercy or remorse for her
husband? She refused him companionship, she refused him sex, she refused him
children. She made no effort to make her marriage work or to save it. She valued
her job above her home, above her husband’s life, even above her love for Freddy –
why else did they not elope? And what kind of lover is she? She complains, she nags,
she coaxes, she ﬂatters, she wheedles; she dominates and manipulates this younger
man who is more straightforward and less clever than she is. When she is feeling
insecure she is, on her own admission, prepared to lie to him, to make up stories, to
keep back presents, even to claim that she has tried to kill her husband. She values
money and respectability above her love for Freddy and, when the crunch comes,
she ditches him and puts the blame on him in order to save her skin: she denies her
love. Who’s the loyal pal, the real lover in the end?
No, this idea of a great romantic love is a great delusion. What is the truth?
Edith Thompson is a calculating, manipulative woman who used others – includ-
ing Freddy – for her own ends. She’s a competent business woman, a manager.
She regularly looks to the future, she calculates. Her world is full of plans and
pacts and plots and schemes. Plans for secret assignations, for getting a job abroad,
for persuading Percy to divorce her, for suicide, and even for murder. There are

telegrams and notes and prearranged signals, and, again and again, a desperate,
persistent searching for ways to get rid of Percy without being found out – “when
the time comes we shall need friends,” “we shall need witnesses,” she says; of
course she wants fun, adventure, risk, even love of a sort: so long as it does not
involve sacriﬁce of security, money, or respectability. What kind of great roman-
tic is this who is not prepared to sacriﬁce anything except her husband and her
lover?
Questions
1 For what kind of audience is this intended? What clues are to be found in this passage?
Is it consistently addressed to the same audience?
2 (a) What is the main purpose of the argument? (b) To what speciﬁc probanda is the
passage relevant?
3 In what ways does this strongly support the relevant probanda? Suggest ways in which
the strength of the support might be increased within this particular framework.
4 Identify elements in the passage that are clearly and unequivocally supported by the
evidence (a) of Edith’s own words (b) by other evidence.
5 Identify elements in the passage that (a) are not supported by any evidence;
(b) involve exaggeration; (c) can be contradicted or explained away or rivaled.
6 Redraft the passage within the framework of the same theory of its function in order
to improve it.
7 Compose an alternative picture of Edith’s character, based on a signiﬁcantly different
theory. Make clear what you have in mind in respect to audience, relevance, and
function; how it strengthens the case as a whole; and how strongly it is supported by
evidence.
8 Analyze this passage and your own in terms of how far there is a tension between logic
and appeals to emotion and how far they mutually sustain each other.
9 In what respects does this passage violate ethical norms or principles of fairness in
argument?
c. Is Ford Motor Company guilty of killing girls with a Pinto?16
The ﬂat northern Indiana farmland is lifeless now. Only the naked oaks and maples
break the emptiness, their branches standing like skeletons against the foreboding
winter sky. A stubble of dead, farrowed cornstalks sticks through the snow, and there
is no sound except for the wind. But the trees were full and green on that August
afternoon in 1978, and the cornstalks stood high and ready to bear. The land was
alive that day, as alive as the three Ulrich girls.
Donna Ulrich, 18, from Roanoke, Ill., was visiting her cousins Judy and Lynn
Ulrich in Osceola, a little town just outside Elkhart in northern Indiana. The girls
were close – bound by blood, age, and interests. Donna was only a day older than
Judy. Lynn was two years younger. All three were deeply religious, their social
