4. Judicial notice and cognitive consensus
a. Judicial notice
In most jurisdictions there are rules concerning “judicial notice,” that is to say “facts
which need not to be proved.” For example, the Federal Rule 201(b) provides: “A
judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is
either (1) generally well known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or
(2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy
cannot reasonably be questioned.” Similarly a leading treatise on the law of evidence
in England and Wales states:
A judge may take judicial notice of facts which are matters of common knowledge and
which could not be the subject of serious dispute. Hence it would be pointless and
wasteful to require evidence of them. Hypothetical possibilities of notorious facts are
limitless: textbook writers frequently cite as illustrations the date of Christmas and the
death of Queen Victoria as facts which would be judicially noticed. Reported cases
contain many examples. The courts have taken judicial notice of the fact that by the
laws of nature, a fortnight is too short a period for human gestation; that cats are kept
for domestic purposes; that London streets carry a large volume of trafﬁc, so that a boy
employed to ride a bicycle through them runs a risk of injury; that the reception of
television is a common feature of domestic life enjoyed primarily for the purposes of
recreation; and that one of the popular forms of entertainment on television is a series
of reconstructed trials which have a striking degree of realism. (Dennis (2002) 424–45.
Citations omitted)
The idea of judicial notice should not be confused with background knowledge
or “common sense generalizations.” It is both wider and narrower. It is wider in that
it includes knowledge of speciﬁc facts (that Lima is the capital of Peru; that the old
Sumter Inn is nine miles from Hadley) (above, page 13). It is narrower because a
great deal of “common sense” or “society’s stock of knowledge” is not well founded
and its accuracy can reasonably be questioned.
Once articulated, many “common sense generalizations” appear dubious on
their face or are open to challenge on a variety of grounds. If so, they technically
fall outside the scope of the doctrine of judicial notice. But in practice prosecutors,
plaintiffs, defense counsel, and courts regularly rely on such beliefs, not because
they are well founded, but because there is no practicable alternative.
b. Cognitive consensus
Writers on evidence talk of “a stock of knowledge” and tend to postulate a high
degree of “cognitive consensus.” The following passage deserves to be treated as the
locus classicus for this view:
The inductivist analysis, [. . . ] presupposes only that when a juryman takes up his
ofﬁce his mind is already adult and stocked with a vast number of commonplace
generalizations about human acts, attitudes, intentions, etc., about the more familiar

features of the human environment, and about the interactions between these two
kinds of factors, together with an awareness of many of the kinds of circumstances that
are favourable or unfavourable to the application of each such generalization. Without
this stock of information in everyday life he could understand very little about his
neighbours, his colleagues, his business competitors, or his wife. He would be greatly
handicapped in explaining their past actions or predicting their future ones. But with
this information he has the only kind of background data he needs in practice for
the assessment of inductive probabilities in the jury-room. He does not need to have
tacitly ingested a mass of quantitative or numerical statistics for this purpose. Nor does
he need implicitly to remember some sophisticated mathematical algorithm in order
to compute the probabilities from the data. The inductive probability of the proposed
conclusion on the facts before the court depends just on the extent to which the facts are
favourable to some commonplace generalizations that connect them to the conclusion.
Not that jurymen are incapable of disagreeing with one another in their assessment
of the probability with which a proposed conclusion has been proved from undisputed
facts. But on any rational reconstruction of their disagreement (when prejudice, per-
sonal sympathy, sectional spite, and other irrational factors may be disregarded) the
disagreement must normally be due to differences of opinion about the kinds of cir-
cumstances that are favourable or unfavourable to the application of some particular
common sense generalization. The main commonplace generalizations themselves are
for the most part too essential a part of our culture for there to be any serious disagree-
ment about them. They are learned from shared experiences, or taught by proverb,
myth, legend, history, literature, drama, parental advice, and the mass media. When
people ceased to believe that those who had insensitive areas of skin were in commerce
with the Devil, it was symptomatic of a major cultural change. Similarly, so long as the
jurymen at a criminal trial are the accused’s peers his case has a reasonable chance of
being judged correctly by them, while if they belong to a different culture they are more
likely to misjudge it even when trying to be fair. But there is still room for occasional
disagreement, even within the same culture, about the kinds of circumstances that
are favourable or unfavourable to the application of some particular common sense
generalization. (L. Jonathan Cohen (1977) 274–76)
This passage has been criticized as presenting a rather complacent view about
common sense generalizations. It should be apparent that Cohen is making an
argument based on a collection of general knowledge and synthetic-intuitive gen-
eralizations that he assumes are so widely shared among the audience of scholars,
lawyers, and judges to whom the argument is addressed that they do not merit fur-
ther documentation or development. The main criticisms that have been advanced
can be summarized as follows:13
First, Cohen assumes that all jurors (and defendants) are male or sexless. But
even within a given culture and class a cross-gender cognitive consensus cannot
always be assumed on such matters as domestic violence, rape, equal pay, or more
generally. Moreover, in a dynamic multi-class, multi-cultural society one cannot

assume an extensive cognitive consensus across classes or cultures or even within
cultures. The idea of a cognitive consensus involving a common stock of knowledge
or beliefs is highly problematic.14
Second, and perhaps most important, standard versions of inferential reasoning
are species of propositional logic. One infers conclusions from premises that are
expressed as propositions. When we talk of “background generalizations” as the
warrants or the glue in this kind of argument, there is a tendency to assume that
we draw these from our stock of knowledge as ready-made propositions. But this
is psychologically implausible. Instead an individual’s or a community’s stock of
beliefs is unlikely to be stored in the form of a neatly categorized code or data base:
A “stock of knowledge” does not consist of individual, empirically tested, and readily
articulated propositions: rather, both individually and collectively, we have ill deﬁned
agglomerations of beliefs that typically consist of a complex soup of more or less
well-grounded information, sophisticated models, anecdotal memories, impressions,
stories, myths, proverbs, wishes, stereotypes, speculations, and prejudices. Fact and
value are not sharply differentiated. Nor are fact, fantasy and ﬁction. Nor can one take
for granted either consistency or coherence within an individual’s or a society’s “stock
of knowledge.” (Twining (1999) 362; Bazaar, 456)
Third, insofar as an individual’s or a group’s stock of beliefs is like a bouillabaisse,
it does not seem like an environment conducive to maintaining clear distinctions
between is and ought, fact and value. Stereotypes, proverbs, and stories typically
have an evaluative element – that is often their main point.15 Cohen’s formulation
does not make sufﬁcient allowance for the relationship between values and facts
in this kind of context – the inﬂuence of bias, prejudice, values, and so on, on
perceptionsofsocialfacts.Cohenassumesthatempiricalgeneralizationscanreadily
be distinguished from judgments of value.
Fourth, the statement is over-simple in other respects; for example, it does not
distinguishamongdifferentexamplesofgeneralizationsinrelationtotheirscientiﬁc
status or empirical base, their level of generality, or the extent to which they are
“purely” factual or contain other components – speculative or evaluative. So too, it
does not adequately distinguish among ﬁrmly held beliefs, matters on which people
have vague ideas, matters on which they are open to suggestion, and matters on
which they are agnostic or would register as “don’t knows.”
Soweneedtorecognizethattheideaofacognitiveconsensusinvolvingacommon
stock of knowledge or beliefs is highly problematic. However, Cohen’s position can
be defended up to a point. He allows that there is not a social consensus about every-
thing; that the stock of knowledge is relative to a given society, and by implication to
14 In the context of “globalization” the idea can be extended beyond a plural or a multi-cultural
society to the point that for many purposes we can no longer treat societies, countries, or nations
as self-contained units with clear and stable boundaries. However, John Rawls’s useful idea of an
overlapping consensus can be used to curb tendencies to exaggerate the extent to which stocks of
belief in fact vary across “cultures” (Rawls (1987); discussed GLT 69–75).

particular subgroups within a society; and that the stock of knowledge can change
over time. He points to the notion that with collegial decision-making, especially by
a jury, the stock of knowledge is a pool drawn from all the members’ “experience.”16
Moreover,incertainkindsofdecision-making,thetriersoffactsareselectedbecause
of their special knowledge and/or values, for example, in jury selection, at least in
the American system. So too, in arbitration it is typical to choose people for their
expertise – that is, some special subcategory of general experience, or to choose
people because of their biases or absence of bias or because they represent certain
kinds of interests, with a view to having a balanced panel that may ﬁnd a middle
way – for instance, one trade unionist, one representative of management, and one
“neutral” (who may or may not be an expert).
From the standpoint of the lawyer, both the view and the criticisms are impor-
tant. Lawyers must identify from the evidence what generalizations may affect the
decision-makers and how commonly and strongly held these generalizations are
likely to be among them. They must rely in part upon their own stock of knowledge
as members of the community, such knowledge about the speciﬁc decision-makers
as they can legitimately acquire through voir dire or otherwise, and such additional
knowledge as they may be able to acquire by study.
5. Dangers of generalizations
As Sidgwick observed, linking generalizations are often the main source of doubt in
an argument. One of the claims for the chart method is that by forcing articulation
of what is being (or might be) argued, one can more readily spot weak points in the
argument.17 In the course of discussion we have seen some examples of weak gen-
eralizations. Here is a summary list of some of the main weaknesses one can expect,
especially in relation to experience based and synthetic-intuitive generalizations.
Generalizations are dangerous18
Generalizations are dangerous in argumentation about doubtful or disputed ques-
tions of fact because they tend to provide invalid, illegitimate, or false reasons for
accepting conclusions based on inference. They are especially dangerous when they
are implicit or unexpressed. For example:
i The warranting generalization may be indeterminate in respect of:
a frequency or universality (all/most/some);
b level of abstraction;
c defeasibility (exceptions, qualiﬁcations);
d precision or “fuzziness”;
16 Some support for the consensus idea is to be found in writings about the jury in which research
suggests that the tendency is toward consensus formation in that kind of decision-making (Abbott
and Ball (eds.) (1999) Ch. 20).
17 A useful technique for showing the weakness of an argument is to show that it relies on a general-
ization that, once articulated, is obviously foolish (see above, page 272).

e empirical base/conﬁdence (accepted by scientiﬁc community; part of everyday
ﬁrsthand/vicarious experience, speculative, etc.);
ii It may be unclear as to identity (which generalization? There may be rival
generalizations available to each side in a dialogue), or source (whose generalization?
e.g. male/female experience in domestic violence cases).
iii When articulated, a generalization may be expressed in value-laden language or in
loaded categories.
iv There are several reasons for treating such ideas as “common-sense generalizations”
and “society’s stock of knowledge” with great caution.
Some of the more obvious ones are as follows:
a By no means all the beliefs in a social stock of knowledge will satisfy even quite relaxed
tests of warranted beliefs. What passes as common sense is often easily shown to be
untrue.
b A high degree of consensus about the contents of the social stock of knowledge or
beliefs cannot be taken for granted, especially in a plural or a stratiﬁed society. The
extent of cognitive consensus varies according to time and place.
c What is commonly referred to as a society’s “stock of knowledge” typically consists of
a complex mixture of “scientiﬁc facts,” impressionistic beliefs, stereotypes, myths,
proverbs, and so on. Value judgments (including prejudices, racist or gender
stereotypes) may be masquerading as empirical propositions.19
d The content of a “stock of knowledge” does not consist solely or mainly of
ready-made generalizations, still less of empirical generalizations. Beliefs may be
embedded in stories, examples, experience, etc., which are particular and which may
not have been articulated in general terms. There is often considerable indeterminacy
about what moral or general lesson or other generalization(s) may or will be
extrapolated from such material.
e What ofﬁcials, including courts, are prepared to recognize as “common sense” may
not correspond with what most people in a given society in fact believe. Even in an
open society some beliefs may be repressed as not being socially acceptable, politically
correct, or otherwise proper. A regime may be “in advance” of public opinion in
respect of such matters as gender, race, or class or vice versa. In repressive societies
ofﬁcial versions of the truth may diverge very substantially from what people in fact
believe.
6. Generalizations: the practitioner’s standpoint
Evaluating the strength of an argument or assessing the net persuasive effect of the
evidence as a whole ordinarily depends upon the signiﬁcant generalizations that the
decision-maker will or can be persuaded to apply. In all cases the decision-maker(s)
will bring an array of generalizations (i.e. a stock of beliefs) that will affect and
may control decisions of disputed questions of fact. It is accordingly important
that lawyers identify generalizations that will or may play a role in a case and how

Analysis of Evidence
that role can be most effectively enhanced or minimized. This requires that they
identify how signiﬁcant generalizations will enter the case; for instance, through
the evidence or as part of the knowledge and beliefs that the fact-ﬁnder brings to
the case. It is the latter that presents the more difﬁcult practical and theoretical
questions.
In preparing an argument for a decision-maker, the lawyer must ﬁrst identify
and appraise the most signiﬁcant generalizations that are available to either side to
enhance or diminish the strength or force of the potential arguments. Ordinarily,
thisposesnospecialdifﬁcultywithrespecttowhatwehaveclassiﬁedasscientiﬁcand
as general knowledge generalizations. The questions whether a claimed scientiﬁc
generalization is well accepted or whether the evidence and an opinion necessary to
establish it as a basis for argument are admissible poses questions of a kind that are
familiar to lawyers and judges.20 Similarly, generalizations that are truly accepted
on the basis of general knowledge in the relevant community must be viewed as
established or simply shown and thus as operative in the case. The challenge here is
for the advocate to use or to counter such generalizations effectively. The remaining
kinds of generalizations present different and more subtle problems.
a. Case-speciﬁc generalizations
The advocate typically must confront several problems with case-speciﬁc general-
izations. They must ﬁrst be identiﬁed and then decisions must be made to appraise
the likelihood that the evidence that will invoke them will be admitted. Facts of the
sort that Edith was 28 and Freddie was 20 will either be admitted or be apparent
to the trier of fact. The facts that Freddie had long been employed as a clerk on
ocean-going ships and that he was in fact carrying a knife on the evening of the
murder are almost certainly going to be admitted in evidence at some stage of the
proceedings.Itisthelawyer’sjobtoidentifythepossiblebackgroundgeneralizations
these facts may evoke and to decide how they may be shaped and used in argument.
In contrast, it is not clear whether evidence of Richard Able’s cocaine use or the
extent to which evidence concerning the events at the disco and those surrounding
his cashing the $25,000 check at a gambling casino will be admitted. Able’s lawyer
must not only identify the possible generalizations that would be evoked, but must
also plan arguments that confront the various contingencies.
b. Experience-based and synthetic-intuitive generalizations
Experience-based and synthetic-intuitive generalizations raise the same problems,
but they also pose an additional difﬁculty. A lawyer may be able to gather in advance
of trial signiﬁcant information about the individual judge’s experience and about
signiﬁcant beliefs and biases that may inﬂuence that judge’s perception of the evi-
dence. In a case tried by a jury, however, the problem is more complex. The lawyer’s
primary opportunity to learn about and shape the experience-based and belief

generalizations likely to inﬂuence the trial outcome will occur during jury voir dire
and selection.
c. Formulation and appraisal
Inadditiontoproblemsofidentiﬁcationandappraisal,however,thereistheproblem
of formulation. This is a problem common to generalizations of all types, and it is
peculiarly a problem that lawyers can shape through argument. The formulation of
thegeneralizationcan vary in a number of respects: Itcanbeframedasauniversalor
as a propensity statement or as something less than that (see above); it can be stated
with varying degrees of precision; it can be stated at different levels of generality; it
may contain an explicit or implicit judgment of value; the choice of words may be
relatively neutral or mildly or strongly emotive; there may be expressed or implied
exceptions or qualiﬁcations.
For the lawyer, the choice of formulation is crucial. The precise, speciﬁc formu-
lation may set up an irrebuttable syllogism compelling the conclusion sought, if the
decision-maker accepts the generalization in that form as true. But in most cases,
the generalization will not be either that well established or that widely shared and
will probably be defeasible. No one believes that “All older women dominate all
younger men all of the time,” and some potential jurors would probably reject such
a generalization in its weakest form.
In analyzing a generalization that plays a potentially important role in an argu-
ment one can adopt a procedure similar to doing a detailed microscopic analysis of
a selected phase of an argument for a Wigmorean chart: clarify standpoint; specify
the proposition to be justiﬁed; specify the proposition or propositions offered as
the basis for its justiﬁcation; identify and articulate the generalization(s) on which
the justiﬁcation depends; submit the generalization(s) to the various tests that have
been discussed above.21 Perhaps the main points can usefully be synthesized into a
rough working protocol as follows:
Protocol for assessing the plausibility and validity of a
generalization in the context of an argument
Standpoint: counsel for defense (pre-trial) in respect of an opponent’s potential
generalization
1 Will the generalization be stated expressly or merely implied?
A. Express
2 If expressly, is it precise?
3 Is it ambiguous?
4 Is it stated as a universal or is it qualiﬁed by a hedge as to frequency
(usually/often/sometimes)?

B. Stories necessary, but dangerous
We have seen in Chapter 6 that stories and story telling are central to fact determi-
nation. A well-grounded story is crucial to organizing and presenting a persuasive
argument. But like generalizations, story telling is vulnerable to abuse. It may be
true that stories and story telling are psychologically necessary to decision-making
in legal contexts, but they are dangerous in that they often can be used to violate
logical standards, appeal to emotion rather than reason, and subvert legal principles
and conventions.
Empirical research by Bennett and Feldman (1981), Pennington and Hastie
(1993), and others suggests that American juries determine “the truth” about
alleged past events mainly by constructing and comparing stories rather than crit-
ically evaluating arguments from evidence. These ﬁndings have been conﬁrmed in
other disciplines (e.g., medical diagnosis and history) and extended to fact deter-
mination by legal professionals and the police (e.g., Wagenaar et al. (1993)). Sim-
ply put, the widely accepted thesis is that human beings need stories in order
to make certain kinds of decisions and, more generally, to make sense of the
world.
The literature is less clear about the exact functions of story construction and
comparison. Bennett and Feldman say they are used to ﬁll in gaps; others suggest in
ordertobesatisﬁed,triersoffactneedtoexplainhumanmotivationandaction,even
whenmotiveisnotamaterialfact,orwhenthefactstobedeterminedrelatetoastatic
situation or a single “simple” fact such as identity. There is scope for disagreement
as to whether stories are psychologically necessary in all situations involving fact
determination in legal contexts (e.g., identity in a motiveless murder), but there
seems to be a consensus that they are in practice felt to be very important a great
deal of the time.
Story telling can also be shown to be dangerous in legal contexts in that it can
be, and is often, used to violate or evade conventional legal norms about relevance,

281
reliability, completeness, prejudicial effect, etc.22 It is widely regarded as appealing
to intuition and emotion and as a vehicle for “irrational means of persuasion.”
Examples of such dangers include:23
i sneaking in irrelevant facts;
ii sneaking in invented or ungrounded facts;
iii suggesting facts by innuendo;24
iv focusing attention on the actor rather than the act;25
v appealing to hidden prejudices or stereotypes;
vi telling the story in emotionally toned language;
vii telling a story that may win sympathy for the speaker or the victim but is irrelevant
to the argument;
viii making use of dubious analogies;
ix subverting lawyers’ distinctions between fact, law, and disposition and, more
generally, fact and value; and
x good stories pushing out true stories.26
Most of these points are illustrated in the materials in Chapter 1 and in the
questions and exercises at the end of this chapter. As with generalizations, one
can develop a rough working protocol for testing the plausibility, coherence, and
evidentiary support for a story, based upon the following questions:
Protocol for assessing the plausibility, coherence, and evidentiary
support for a story
Standpoint: counsel (on either side) preparing for trial
Is the story fully articulated? Or is it largely implied? If so, what exactly is the story?
If articulated:
Is the story internally consistent?
Is there any evidence in this case that seems to conﬂict with the story?
To what extent does the evidence in the case support this story?
Are there any elements in the story not supported by evidence? To what extent are
they based on speculation?
Does the story sneak in expressly or by innuendo:
Any irrelevant facts
Any invented facts
Any inadmissible facts?
22 Such norms include: judge the act not the actor; consider only relevant evidence; argue from
evidence, not speculation; and keep separate questions of fact, law, and disposition.
23 For a detailed account see Rethinking Ch. 7, Bazaar Chs. 12–16.
24 See Ch. 1, B 4 Sam’s Party.
25 To give a simple example: at common law, evidence of disposition or bad character (such as prior
convictions) is not normally admissible to support a criminal charge, but character is often an
important but implicit part of a story (FRE 404–6). On the changes introduced in England by the
Criminal Justice Act, 2003 see Roberts and Zuckerman (2004) 511–15; on the controversy behind
these changes, see Zander (2003) 413–22.

Analysis of Evidence
Can the story be told in a neutral way or does it expressly or impliedly involve value
judgments?
Does it appeal to hidden prejudices or stereotypes?
Does the story ﬁt some familiar story, such as Cinderella or the parable of the Prodigal
Son or Lady Macbeth? If so, what is the relevance of this?
Does the story cast any of the actors in a bad light in a way that subverts the principle:
judge the act, not the actor?
Does the telling of the story distort the facts so that a good story (entertaining, funny,
exciting etc.) squeezes out a less interesting true story?
Does the story purport to “make sense” of the original episode or the motivation of
one or more principal actors?
Is the story calculated to win sympathy for the victim/complainant/accused beyond
what is supported by particular evidence?
Insofar as the story goes beyond the data, is it supported by plausible background
generalizations?27
C. The relationship between stories and generalizations
If generalizations and stories are both necessary, but dangerous, how are they con-
nected? It might be objected that the two theses apply to different spheres of dis-
course. Generalizations are logically necessary in the context of rational argument;
stories are psychologically necessary in the context of human decision making. The
logical “dangers” are different from the dangers of poor “judgment.”
The relationship between logic and psychology in relation to decision-making
is a very large subject. Here, we conﬁne ourselves to two points. First, some of
the functions of story telling are to do with human interaction and communi-
cation, and are not performing a function in an argument. For example, in oral
presentation by an advocate, stories may legitimately be used to attract and retain
interest, set a comprehensible context, and provide concrete illustrations to assist
understanding. They may, of course, be used to distract attention or win sym-
pathy for the speaker or the victim independently of what is at issue and so on.
So, some of the functions and dangers are to do with communication rather than
argumentation.
However, stories also seem to have a place within arguments and questions can be
asked about the legitimacy, validity, or cogency of their place in this context. Some
of the allegations about the dangers of stories seem to be appealing to standards of
rationality. For example, a story-winning sympathy for the speaker independently
of the issue can be criticized as irrelevant to the argument; where a good story
27 In Anchored Narratives (1993) three Dutch psychologists, Wagenaar, Crombag, and Van Koppen,
usefully link stories and generalizations. However, they greatly exaggerate the importance of gen-
eralizations as direct “anchors” for stories, for generalizations should only be used to play this role
in the absence of particular evidence to support the story. Particular evidence will nearly always
give stronger support than a background generalization. A story is as vulnerable to attack as the
generalizations that support it. See further Bazaar Ch. 13.

283
pushes out a true story, it can be criticized on the ground its attraction is to do with
something other than truth (e.g., excitement, reassurance, titillation), and undue
weight is being given to it. (See Bazaar Ch. 14.) Where a story is used to ﬁll in gaps in
the evidence, its justiﬁcatory force may be little or none, and it seems odd to claim
that an argument about a question of fact is bolstered by claiming the situation is
analogous to a work of ﬁction or a parable (Bazaar Ch. 16).
One version of this position may be restated as follows: In ordinary life and
in making important decisions we need stories in order to “make sense” of the
world and of particular past events; in factual inquiries, including adjudication,
for a story to be accepted as true it needs to be warranted by (or anchored in)
evidence. A well-formed story needs to be coherent, but to be true, it must be both
plausible and backed by particular evidence. Plausibility is tested by background
generalizations; the truth of speciﬁc factual conclusions is tested by reasoning from
particular evidence.
There are also important examples, mainly in the Anglo-American literature on
advocacy and adjudication, of claims that stories play a crucial role not merely in
respect of presentation and rhetoric, but analytically as part of an argument. For
instance, in a much cited paper, John W. Davis maintained, “in an appellate court
the statement of the facts is not merely a part of the argument, it is more often than
not the argument itself” (Davis (1953) 181). Similar statements have been made
by Karl Llewellyn, James Boyd White, and other American jurists.28 The precise
meanings of such statements are not always clear, but it is reasonable to interpret
them as maintaining that such notions as stories need to be accommodated within
a conception of rational argument in legal contexts. Such claims are controversial,
but if, for the sake of argument, we accept them as plausible, the question remains:
What is the relationship between stories and generalizations in this context?
Perhaps the main link lies in the idea of “a stock of knowledge.” As we have seen, a
“stock of knowledge” does not consist of individual, empirically tested, and readily
articulated propositions, still less of empirical laws.29 Beliefs may be embedded
in stories, examples, and experiences that are particular and may not have been
articulated in general terms. There is often considerable indeterminacy about what
moral or general lesson or other generalization(s) may or will be extrapolated from
such material.
Generalizations may be indeterminate as to their application; stories may be
indeterminate as to their signiﬁcance. There is an intimate interaction between the
general and the particular in all arguments about questions of fact. One aspect of
the relationship between generalizations and stories can be usefully analyzed with
greater precision. Generalizations are, by deﬁnition, general; stories are particular.30
There is, as every lawyer knows, an intimate relationship between general rules and
particular cases. Similarly, as every theologian and moralist should know, there is

an intimate relationship between parables (and other morality tales) and their
signiﬁcance. That signiﬁcance can be expressed in such terms as the point or
the moral or some other general lesson or idea that it illustrates. Stories appeal
strongly to the imagination. Part of that appeal lies in their concreteness and
their particularity. That power can be undermined if the moral or point is spelled
out or otherwise made explicit. Why this should be so is crucial in the present
context.
The idea of precedent as a source of law is an especially clear illustration of
the interaction between the general and the particular.31 Because precedents are
especially important in the common law, there has been much theorizing and
controversy about “the problem of the ratio decidendi.” We need not venture into
that old controversy here because on several relevant points there is widespread
agreement. “The facts” of a case are particular. The facts, at least in a hard case,
give rise to a question of law. Such questions of law should be expressed in general
terms, not “Is the defendant guilty or liable?” but “In circumstances of this type,
is the defendant guilty or liable?” In deciding the particular case, the court gives
an authoritative answer to the question(s) of law. That answer may be explicit or
implicit.
The relationship between the facts, the issue(s), and the answer can be formally
restated as follows: the facts = X happened; the issue = if X happens, then what?
(legal consequence); the answer = whenever X happens, then Y.
In this formulation X is a constant despite the transition from particular to
general.Thistransitionfromaparticularsituationtogeneralquestionsandageneral
answer involves a shift from “this was the situation” to “in situations of this type,
the law prescribes . . . ” The crucial point in this context is that X is a constant. In
short, X=X=X.
One of the main problems in interpreting cases is that the level of generality of
X is indeterminate. The same applies to “the moral” of parables and morality tales.
But if the facts are known, and if X=X=X, how can X be clear at the particular
level, but unclear at the general level? The answer is, of course, that how exactly the
facts are to be categorized is also indeterminate. X represents a particular situation
seen as a type. How precisely that situation should be interpreted, what elements
are material, and what is the best or an appropriate description of the situation
is a matter of interpretation. And, since X=X=X, the problem of interpreting X is
almost constant.32
Descriptions of situations are typically expressed in language. The choice of
language is not signiﬁcant solely because of the more or less obvious rhetorical
potential of emotive or value laden terms. For example, a categorization may be
judged appropriate because it reﬂects the way a signiﬁcant reference group thinks or
talks (for instance, using the concepts of a particular trade to describe the situation
in a commercial case), or because it corresponds with or ﬁts, explicitly or implicitly,

some general principle or policy (for example describing a situation in a way that
bringsoutthatanon-expertwasrelyingonthejudgmentofanexpertinareasonably
proximate relationship).33 This idea of choosing appropriate categories to describe
particular fact situations is at the core of Karl Llewellyn’s important, but elusive,
idea of “situation sense.” 34
Some of the alleged “dangers” of stories shared with generalizations include,
for example, presenting unsupported facts as if they were anchored or appealing
explicitly or implicitly to biases or prejudices. Perhaps the most obvious common
element is indeterminacy: Indeterminacy as to what exactly is being argued or is the
general signiﬁcance of the particular example. For example, what precisely is the
moral of the parable of the prodigal son? Indeterminacy is generally presented as a
weakness in an argument. But, as John Wisdom points out, one of the attractions
of case by case argument is that one is not forced to deﬁne the boundaries of X in
advance.35 It can be valid and sensible to say, “This is a clear case of X” without
deﬁning X. That is part of the key to understanding the attraction of precedent
at common law. It is a form of argument by analogy which does not commit the
arguer to a position beyond what is needed for the case at hand.
D. Generalizations, stories, and themes: questions and exercises
The materials in Chapter 1 contain a great deal that is directly relevant to points
made about stories and generalizations in Chapter 3 and this chapter. At this
stage it may help to draw a lot of threads together by revisiting some of these
examples.
Generalizations
Review the material on the testimony of Ofﬁcer Connolly in the Sacco and Vanzetti
case (Ch. 1, C4a) to the effect that during his arrest Sacco attempted on several occa-
sions to put his hand under his overcoat in spite of being warned not to. Figure 10.3
is a reconstruction of the prosecution’s argument that Connolly’s testimony sup-
ported the conclusion that Sacco took part in the robbery and murder at South
Braintree on April 15, 1920. Each step in the chain of inferences involves an implicit
generalization as a warrant.36

a duty of care in respect of negligent misstatements causing ﬁnancial loss:
They were professional accountants who prepared and put before him these accounts, knowing
that he was going to be guided by them in making an investment in the company. On the faith
of those accounts he did make the investment, whereas, if the accounts had been carefully
prepared, he would not have made the investment at all. The result is that he has lost his money.

1 Adopting the standpoint of counsel for Sacco:
a Articulate the least vulnerable formulation of the generalization that is needed as a
warrant for each step in the chain of inferences;
b Classify each generalization according to the scheme suggested in Chapter 10 (e.g.,
case-speciﬁc, scientiﬁc/expert, etc.);
c Assess the plausibility, reliability, and probative force of each generalization in this
context;
d How might counsel for Sacco deal with this item of evidence (i) in
cross-examination of Connolly; (ii) in closing?
2 Review the materials and questions in Chapter 1 Section B, especially B1 (Solomon),
B3 (Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes), B4 (Sam’s Party), and C3a (The Brides in the
Bath). In respect of each, identify, formulate, and categorize the explicit or implicit
generalizations involved in the reasoning and assess their plausibility in their
respective contexts.

and drawing on different kinds of generalizations, can you construct a plausible
argument that:

a Upham Sargent was suicidal;
b Given the length of the Nottaway River, an experienced outdoors man like Upham
Sargent would have the skills to ﬁnd his way back to safety without getting lost,
unless he has sustained a serious injury.
4 Review the case of Huddleston v. United States (C3b). Consider carefully Question 2
(a–d).
5 Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes (B3).
a To what extent does the reasoning of Joseph Bell rely on speciﬁc local knowledge,
background generalizations, case-speciﬁc generalizations? Can these categories be
clearly distinguished in this context?
b What generalizations are implicit in Holmes’s reasoning towards the conclusion
that Watson had been in Afghanistan? What is the weakest point in this chain of
reasoning?
Stories
1 “The Nine Mile Walk” (Ch.1, C2). Kemelman has produced a splendid example of
imaginative reasoning that has led to identifying two suspects, but it is a long way from
proving the case against either of them. Assuming for the sake of argument that one of
the suspects is in fact the murderer, construct an account of his movements during the
past 24 hours that explains why he was in Hadley and why he made the remark about
the nine mile walk. Bear in mind that any alibi claims can probably be checked fairly
easily and that if he is caught lying this will weaken his position. Does the strategy of
your story rely mainly on denial (OD), rival (OR), or explanation (OE)?
2 Review the quotation from Lord Denning in Miller v. Jackson (Ch. 1, C3c).
a How many examples of using a story to “cheat” can you ﬁnd in this text, read by
itself?
b Would your answer be different if the following “facts” were added: At the time
Lintz was a depressed former mining village in County Durham; the Millers had a
small child; the Millers were not the only people who had complained about the
cricket; no evidence was adduced at trial about the attitude of the cows.
Stories and argument
In an appellate court, the statement of the facts is not merely a part of the argument, it
is more often than not the argument itself. (John W. Davis (1940))
It is trite that it is in the statement of facts that the advocate has his ﬁrst, best, and most
precious access to the court’s attention. The court does not know the facts, and it wants
to. It is trite among good advocates, that the statement of the facts can, and should in the
very process of statement, frame the legal issue, and can and should, simultaneously
produce the conviction that there is only one sound result. It is as yet less generally
perceived as a conscious matter that the pattern of the facts as stated must be a simple
pattern, with its lines of simplicity never lost under detail; else attention wanders, or
(which is as bad) the effect is submerged in the court’s effort to follow the presentation
or to organize the material for itself. (Karl Llewellyn (1962) 341–42)

Analysis of Evidence
[W]e can say that both the history and the tapestry are in this respect like a law case: the
lawyer knows that to prove his (or her) case he must not only demonstrate the truth or
probability of certain propositions of fact; he must present to the judge or juror a way
of looking at the cases as a whole that will make sense; and it must “make sense” not
merely as a matter of factual likelihood, but as a predicate to judgment, as a basis for
action. While a case can in a technical sense be refuted by disproving one element or
another, in practice the lawyer knows that he must do more than that: he must offer the
judge or juror an alternative place to stand, another way of making sense of the case as
a whole. To do his job, that is, the lawyer must both engage in an accurate retelling of
the facts and make his own claim for what they mean. (James Boyd White (1985) 160)
Questions
1 Are these passages concerned with questions of fact or questions of law or both?
2 How can a statement of facts be an argument?
3 Give an example of a persuasive statement of facts.
4
a Consider the case of In re the Estate of James Earl Warren in Chapter 12: Construct
a persuasive story on behalf of James Warren Jr.
b Many students preparing to try this case immediately see an analogy with the
Parable of the Prodigal Son (St Luke, Ch. 15). They suggest that it could provide a
powerful theme for one side, especially in closing argument.
i What is the moral or point of the parable?
ii Which side might use it to support their case in Warren?
iii What fact of consequence in the Warren case might the analogy with the
parable be used to support?
iv How can the behavior of a father in Palestine in the time of Christ be relevant to
making a judgment about the behavior of a father in the United States in the
late twentieth century?
v How can a ﬁctitious story that is nearly 2000 years old be used as evidence in a
modern case?
vi Can you think of a modern story that might be used to support the other side?37
5 Edith Thompson. Construct a story about Edith’s relationship with Freddie and Percy
that casts persuasive doubts on the prosecution case and is backed in all important
respects by evidence reproduced in Chapter 7.
6 It is said that good stories often ease out true stories. Give three examples.
37 These issues are discussed in Bazaar Ch. 12.
