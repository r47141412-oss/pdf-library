Thepointtoberecognizedisthatthecommonlawadversarialmodelofadjudica-
tion allocates roles and functions in an appropriate fashion. The primary responsi-
bility for analysis is among the responsibilities assigned to the lawyers. It is they who
analyze the data; construct and critique hypotheses and arguments; and develop
what they see as the strongest theory of the case on each side.
They marshal the evidence and arguments that best support (or confound) the
contending theories. On the basis of that analysis, they construct the stories that
they will urge the ultimate decision-maker to adopt and identify points on which
the opposing side’s best story is likely to be most vulnerable.
In this model, using stories as the basis for decision is efﬁcient. In the common
law model the trial is a separate and isolated event. The lawyers for the contending
adversaries present the evidence that they have culled from the universe of available
and potentially relevant data and present the contending theories, arguments, and
storiesthattheyhaveselectedanddeveloped.Thecontendingstoriesandthelawyers’
argumentsattackinganddefendingeachstoryprovide,inprinciple,asoundmethod
of processing information to aid the judge or jury in resolving, efﬁciently, ﬁnally,
and accurately, the factual issues necessary to a fair judgment. So long as the analysts
have done their jobs well, it is hard to see why we would want a system that would
require the ultimate decision maker to replicate, rather than assess, their work as a
basis for resolving disputed questions of fact necessary to reach a judgment on the
case as a whole.14
Theprocessbywhichjuriesorotherfact-ﬁnderschoosebetweenstoriesislogical.
The evidence is rarely conclusive. If there are genuine factual disputes, the fact-
ﬁnder must form a belief by testing the available stories against a recollection of
the evidence and an assessment of the likelihood that a particular story is the most
plausible version of what really took place in light of their commonly held beliefs
or other generalizations. The nature of closing argument is to reassure the fact-
ﬁnder that the evidence “logically” makes one story the most plausible and to focus
its attention on the inconsistencies and logical fallacies in the opponent’s story in
relation to the central legal principles laid down by the judge. Of necessity (because
of such factors as time and audience attention span), the lawyers must strike for
the jugular: Normally, only the weakest links in the opposition’s chain of inferences
and only those that cut against belief in its story-as-a-whole can be attacked; there
is neither time nor purpose for attack on secondary detail. The making of such a
focused argument, however, must be preceded by logical, atomistic analysis and be
combined with judgment.
Atomistic analysis remains a central tool for identifying the plausible story possi-
bilities, for checking them for consistency and coherence, and for choosing among
them. It remains necessary, even though all must concede it is not sufﬁcient. In
that light, the contribution of the story-theorists is to focus attention upon the

of decision-making).

relationships between the logical theory of a case, the dramatic themes by which
the theory may be developed most plausibly in trial, and the story-as-a-whole.
State v. Archer (IV): the exercise concludes
The facts remain as developed through State v. Archer (III) (above, page 143). The
prosecutor has learned that Archer hosted the party on Saturday, the day preceding
the murder, and that Boswell and Carl had drinks at Archer’s house on the Tuesday
after the murder. Through Detective Paul’s interviews and investigations, she has
also learned that the termination of the partnership between Boswell and Vern was
initiated by Vern and left Boswell embittered and that Carl believed that Vern’s
refusal to marry his sister had caused her to commit suicide.
1. The prosecution standpoint
a
Theory of the case. Based upon the available data, state the theory of the case that you
now think a competent prosecutor should seek to develop. The statement should
compel the conclusion that Archer is guilty, if the facts assumed are accepted as true.
It should rely, however, only on those facts that are most likely to be accepted in light
of the evidence available to the prosecution and the defense. The statement should
take no more than a paragraph or two.
b
Story of the case. On the basis of the theory developed, construct the story that you
could argue is the only plausible story of what happened. Assuming that further
investigation did not undermine your provisional theory, this would be the story of
the evidence that you could recommend that the prosecution develop in her opening
statement. Again, compress the essential account into a couple of paragraphs.
c
Themes for the case. Identify and state the one or, at most, two best themes the
prosecutor might rely upon in presenting the case, if the provisional theory and story
withstand further investigation.
2. The defense standpoint
Assume the standpoint of counsel for the defendant. Through further interviews,
counselforthedefensehasalsolearnedthatBoswellwasbitteroverwhatheperceived
as Vern’s wrongful termination of their partnership and that Carl blamed Vern for
his only sister’s death. In appraising the case for the defense, you would have made
an assessment of the prosecution’s case similar to that developed in response to
item one of this exercise. Now repeat the exercise for the defense (a) stating the
provisional theory of the case for the defense in narrative form, (b) constructing
the most plausible story for the defense at this stage, and (c) identifying the one or
two most promising themes defense counsel might choose to develop.

Analyzing the decided case: anatomy
of a cause c´el`ebre
A. Introduction
Rex v. Bywaters and Thompson is one of England’s most famous causes c´el`ebres.
On January 9, 1923, Frederick Bywaters and Edith Thompson were hanged for the
murder of Edith’s husband Percy, just three months and six days after his death. The
case is an example of rough as well as speedy “justice.” Public opinion at the time
and subsequent commentators have been divided on the question whether Edith
was guilty as charged and on a number of subsidiary issues.
In our experience, Bywaters and Thompson is a particularly good vehicle for
classroom consideration of modiﬁed Wigmorean analysis for several reasons:
a It is interesting in itself;
b It is a good test of macroscopic analysis not only because it involves a complex mixed
mass of evidence, but also because uncertainties about the law relating to aiding and
abetting, conspiring and incitement, raise challenging questions about precisely what
it was that the prosecution had to prove in order to establish a case that was sufﬁcient
to support a conviction in respect of Edith;
c There were several possible theories of the case available to each side;
d Several key phases of the evidence, including some passages in Edith’s letters, invite
careful microscopic analysis; and
e Some of the key evidentiary issues relate to what Jerome Frank called “wild facts,” that
is to say issues relating to such elusive matters as motive, intent, the characters and
relationships of the main actors, and the language of lovers. Edith’s letters in
particular provide an excellent test of the uses and limitations of careful analysis. As
one student put it: “If you can analyze Edith’s prose, you can analyze anything.”
The materials presented here are a selection from the trial record of the proceed-
ings as published in the Notable British Trials Series (F. Young, 2nd edn., 1951).
This is only some of the evidence in the case, but it is sufﬁcient for present purposes.
We recommend that students read through the materials as a whole to orient them-
selves and to form a general impression and then work systematically through the
record using the questions at pages 220–23 as a guide. The main disputed issue at
the trial was and has remained: Was Edith guilty as charged in the ﬁrst indictment?
The prosecution did not proceed with the second indictment, but it raises some
interesting issues and provides some clues to the prosecution’s strategy at trial.

Analysis of Evidence
There is an extensive secondary literature on the case.1 We recommend, however,
that you work through the material before considering secondary literature, which
might serve as a diversion from the enterprise of applying modiﬁed Wigmorean
analysis to a particularly complex and elusive body of evidence and of appraising
the method in the context of analyzing a decided case.
OurexperiencehasbeenthatRexv.BywatersandThompson isaparticularlygood
vehicleforlearninghowtoanalyzeacomplexmixedmassofevidence.Thequestions
at the end of this chapter are designed to follow the seven step protocol for the chart
method (Chapter 5, above). The case also provides useful illustrations of several
points about standpoint, theory and theme, “jugulars,” stories and generalizations
(see below, Chapter 10), and much else besides. However, many other trial records,
some rather less complex, are suitable for the purpose. So too are hypothetical
trial problems such as Wainwright and Weller (below, pages 326–9, 343–78). In
our experience, the following cases also work well either for discussion in class or
for written exercises. They are backed up by relevant literature, including the full
trial record: Sacco and Vanzetti; Leo Frank; Roger Tichborne; New Jersey v. Hauptman
(the Lindbergh Baby case); Louise Woodward (the Boston nanny case), the Lockerbie
bombing or O. J. Simpson.2

materials is vast. Based on our experience of teaching we recommend the following guidelines
for selection: (1) Primary materials (e.g. trial records) are preferable to secondary sources; (2)
The case should be sufﬁciently complex to illustrate the value of macroscopic analysis as a tool of
fact management; (3) There should be a historical doubt about the outcome. This is important to

to death. She now appeals against conviction. The charge against her was in point
of law that she was what is called a principal in the second degree; that is to say, that
she was a person present at the commission of the offence who aided and abetted
the commission of the offence, and, to put it in a slightly different way, the point
of the charge against this woman was that she incited and aided and abetted the
commission of this crime upon the night of the 3rd day of October. Now, before I
come to deal with the argument that has been presented on behalf of the appellant
by Sir Henry Curtis Bennett, it is necessary, as shortly as possible, to review some of
the facts of this essentially commonplace and unedifying case. The appellant, Edith
Jessie Thompson, is twenty-nine years of age. She is the daughter of a Mr. Graydon,
and seven years ago she married Mr. Percy Thompson, the man now dead, the only
person who in this case excites any sympathy.
At the time of his death he was thirty-two years of age. They lived in a part
of a house at Ilford, called No. 41 Kensington Gardens; and the evidence was
that the appellant and her husband were not on good terms with each other. She
was employed as manageress of a ﬁrm of milliners in Aldersgate Street, where she
received a salary of £6 a week in addition to a bonus. Some time ago, a considerable
time ago, the appellant made the acquaintance of Bywaters, a young steward on a
liner, whose case was dealt with this morning. He had stayed with them elsewhere
and in their own house, and it is quite obvious from many portions of the evidence
that the terms upon which she and Bywaters had come to be, long before the 3rd
October of this year, were terms of the most culpable intimacy. Bywaters was from
time to time absent on his ship. It is not necessary even for the sake of clearness to
examine closely the chronology in the case; but there were periods when he was at
home and there were periods when he was away, and the periods when he was away
are to a great extent covered by a remarkable and deplorable correspondence, full
of the most mischievous and perilous stuff. In August of last year Bywaters, accord-
ing to the evidence, made a statement to his mother about the unhappy life of
Mrs. Thompson, and the evidence showed, if the jury accepted it, as they appar-
ently did, that on more than one occasion Bywaters had called at the warehouse
where Mrs. Thompson was employed, that he had kept up this protracted corre-
spondence with her. The letters which are actually made exhibits began with the
11th of August, 1921, and they continue right down to the 2nd October, 1922 – that
is to say, the day before the commission of the crime – and the evidence further was
that after an absence of some weeks, Bywaters began a new period of leave on the
29th September last. There was evidence that he was with the appellant at a neigh-
bouring teashop upon that day; and again upon Tuesday, the 3rd day of October.
That was the day upon which the crime was committed. On that Tuesday, the 3rd
October, the appellant and her husband went to a theatre with the husband’s uncle,
Mr. Laxton. Upon that same evening Bywaters went to the house of the appellant’s
father; and it appears to have been mentioned at that house that the Thompsons had
gone to the theatre. Bywaters left about ten o’clock or a little after ten. Somewhat
later the appellant and her husband, with Mr. Laxton, went to the Piccadilly Tube

Analysis of Evidence
station, about a quarter to eleven. There, it was said, they were apparently on
good terms, and it is clear from what followed that they made their way home by
train to Ilford. Shortly before midnight a Miss Pittard was walking with Mr. and
Mrs. Clevely from Ilford station, and their way took them through a road called
Belgrave Road, and when they were between De Vere Gardens and Endsleigh
Gardens, both places not far from Kensington Gardens, where the Thompsons’
own house was, Mrs. Thompson came running to him. She was agitated and inco-
herent. She said – “Oh, my God, will you help me, my husband is ill; he is bleeding.”
And she said he was on the pavement and asked those persons to go or take her
and get a doctor. They took her to the house of a doctor, Dr. Maudsley, and then
Mrs. Thompson ran back. A witness was called named Webber, who lived about 30
or 40 yards away from that place, and he said that as he was going to bed he heard a
woman’s voice, a voice which he now recognised as Mrs. Thompson’s voice, calling
in piteous tones, “Oh, don’t, don’t.” He went outside, and three or four minutes
later he saw three persons coming from Dr. Maudsley’s house. Mrs. Thompson
was in front running and sobbing. He followed, and found Mrs. Thompson and
Mr. Thompson. He asked her if he could help, and she said, “Don’t touch him, don’t
touch him; a lady and a gentleman have gone off for a doctor.” Miss Pittard and
Mr. Clevely then came up, and they found the appellant kneeling down by
Mr. Thompson, who was lying upon the footpath in Belgrave Road with his back
propped against the wall. The place was dark. Mr. Clevely struck a match, and Miss
PittardaskedMrs.Thompsonwhathadhappened;andtheappellantanswered,“Oh,
do not ask me; I do not know. Somebody ﬂew past, and when I turned to speak
to him blood was pouring out of his mouth.” A few minutes later Dr. Maudsley
arrived, and he found that Mr. Thompson was dead. He thought he had been dead
then about ten minutes. Mrs. Thompson was standing by his side, and he described
her as being confused, hysterical, and agitated. He asked her if Mr. Thompson
had been ill coming home, and she said “No.” He told her that Mr. Thompson was
dead, and she said, “Why did not you come sooner and save him?” The doctor made
no examination then. He saw the blood. He did not see any wound, but he sent for
thepolice.Apolice sergeant took the appellant to herhouse,andonthewayshesaid,
“Willhecomeback?Theywillblamemeforthis.”Now,theplacewherethebodywas

body to the mortuary and undressed it, and it was examined; and a great number of
wounds were found upon it. The most serious wounds were three stabs, apparently
inﬂicted from behind, one of which penetrated down to and opened the gullet.
Mr. Thompson’s brother was sent for, and shortly before two o’clock in the
morning he arrived at Mrs. Thompson’s house. She told her brother-in-law that
Mr. Thompson was walking along and suddenly came over queer and said “Oh!”
and that on the way from the station he had complained of pains in his legs, and
that she had met a lady and gentleman and had gone for a doctor, and when they
got back he was dead.

At three o’clock in the morning two police sergeants went to Mrs. Thompson’s
house and saw her. She was asked if she could explain what had happened on the
road, and she said, “I do not know, I cannot say; I only know that my husband
suddenly dropped down and screamed out ‘Oh!’ I then rushed across the road and
saw a lady and gentleman, and asked them if they would help me, and they went
with me for the doctor.” She was asked whether she could account for the cuts on
her husband’s neck, and she said, “No. We were walking along, and my husband
said ‘Oh,’ and I said ‘Bear up,’ thinking he had one of his attacks.” He then fell on
her, and walked a little further. He then fell up against the wall and then on the
ground. She was asked if her husband carried a knife, and she said “No.” She was
asked if she was carrying a knife in her handbag, and she said “No.” She was also
asked if she or her husband saw or spoke to any person in Belgrave Road, and she
said, “No; I did not notice any one.” About eleven o’clock in the morning of the
4th October Inspector Hall saw Mrs. Thompson at her house, and she told him:
“We were coming along Belgrave Road and just passed the corner of Endsleigh
Gardens when I heard him call out, ‘Oh, er,’ and he fell up against me. I put out my
arms to save him, and found blood which I thought was coming from his mouth.
I tried to hold him up. He staggered for several yards towards Kensington Gardens
and then fell against the wall and slid down. He did not speak to me; I cannot
say if I spoke to him. I felt him, and found his clothing wet with blood. He never
moved after he fell. We had no quarrel on the way; we were quite happy together.
Immediately I saw blood I ran across the road to a doctor’s. I appealed to a lady
and gentleman who were passing, and the gentleman also went to the doctor’s. The
doctor came and told me my husband was dead. Just before he fell down I was
walking on his right hand side on the inside of the pavement nearest the wall. We
were side by side. I did not see anybody about at the time. My husband and I were
talkingaboutgoingtoadance.”ThateveningMrs.Thompsonwastakentothepolice
station, and on the 5th October she made a statement which became exhibit No. 3 at
the trial. I shall not read it all; but it is to be observed that in that statement made
when she went to the police station she says this: “I have always been on affectionate
terms with my husband. I remember Tuesday, the 3rd October, we both went to
our respective businesses that day; I met my husband by appointment at a quarter
to six in Aldersgate Street.” She then describes how they went to the theatre and
how they came home; and then she describes or purports to describe what took
place, and she says, amongst other things, this – “I cannot remember whether I
saw any one else there or not. I know there was no one there when he staggered
up against me.” She went on to speak of Bywaters and her knowledge of Bywaters.
She said, “I am not in possession of any letters he wrote to me. I have destroyed
them all, as is customary with me with all my correspondence. When he was at
home in England we were in the habit of going out occasionally together without
my husband’s knowledge.” According to that statement she had not seen Bywaters
that night; she did not associate Bywaters with what had taken place, and she was on
good terms with Mr. Thompson, her husband. Now it happened that at the police

station she saw Bywaters, who had been taken to the police station, and was in the
library as she passed, and she then said, “Oh God, oh God, what can I do? Why
did he do it? I did not want him to do it. I must tell the truth.” And then she made
a further statement, which is exhibit No. 4. In that short statement she said this –
“When we got near Endsleigh Gardens a man rushed out from the Gardens and
knocked me and pushed me away from my husband. I was dazed for a moment.
When I recovered I saw my husband scufﬂing with a man. The man who I know as
Freddie Bywaters was running away. He was wearing a blue overcoat and a grey hat.
I knew it was him although I did not see his face.” The two were afterwards charged
together. The knife with which these wounds had been inﬂicted was found in a
neighbouring drain, and I do not think I need dwell upon the rest of the evidence.
Dr. Spilsbury said that all the wounds except the one on the arm of Mr. Thompson
were stabs.
The appellant Bywaters gave evidence ﬁrst, and Mrs. Thompson gave evidence,
and I shall have to refer in a moment to the denials she made. She said, among
other things, that she ﬁrst fell in love with Bywaters in September, 1921, and that
she had told her husband that she had given him cause for divorce. The jury, having
heard the whole of the evidence, both that which I have summarised and much else,
came to the conclusion that the appellant was guilty of wilful murder.
Now, what are the pleas that are put forward on behalf of the appellant in this
appeal? Sir Henry Curtis Bennett at the outset stated, and very frankly stated, that
before he came into Court this morning he had decided to abandon that ground of
appeal which rested upon the allegation that this appellant and Bywaters ought to
have been tried separately, but were in fact tried together. That ground of appeal is
not persisted in. But Sir Henry says – he puts it in more than one way, but it is really
the same contention illustrated and sought to be enforced from different points of
view – that in order that this appellant might properly be convicted of this crime
there ought to be evidence showing not merely that as between her and Bywaters
there was a community of purpose in this matter, but that that community of
purpose continued right up to the crucial moment when the crime was committed;
and in regard to that complaint Sir Henry relies especially upon two matters. He
relies ﬁrst upon the letters and the use to which they were put or not put; and
secondly, he relies upon certain portions in the summing up, where he says the
learned judge not only misdirected the jury in the sense of inviting them to ﬁnd
what they could not ﬁnd, but also omitted to direct the jury in the sense that
he did not adequately put before the jury what the defence of the appellant was.
With regard to the letters, in the opinion of this Court there was more than one
ground upon which the use of these letters could be justiﬁed. It is enough for the
present purpose to say that they could be justiﬁed upon this ground – that by
means of them the prosecution were seeking to show that continuously over a long
period, beginning before and culminating in the time immediately antecedent to
the commission of the crime, Mrs. Thompson was, with every sort of ingenuity, by

precept and by example, actual or simulated, endeavouring to incite Bywaters to
the commission of this crime. I am not going to read those letters. There is a great
mass of them. Many of them were read at the trial. They begin in the summer of
1921, and they continue until the 2nd October, 1922; that is to say, they continue
until the day before the day upon which this crime was committed. Now, what is it
that those letters may reasonably be regarded as showing? First of all, they show a
passionate and, in the circumstances, a wicked affection between Mrs. Thompson
and Bywaters. Secondly, they contain what purport to be accounts of efforts which
have been made, sometimes without the assistance of Bywaters, sometimes with the
assistance of Bywaters, to get Mr. Thompson out of the way. Thirdly – and this is
a thread that runs through the whole skein of these letters – there is the continual
entreaty and hope that that which they both desire will somehow be accomplished.
Now, in the opinion of the Court, the theory that these letters, so far as they purport
to describe attempts made upon the life of Mr. Thompson, are mere nonsense –
“Vapour,” as Bywaters calls them – “Melodramatic nonsense,” as learned counsel
has thought ﬁt to call them – is a theory which cannot be accepted. But however that
may be, if the question is, as I think it was, whether these letters were evidence of a
protracted, continuous incitement to Bywaters to commit the crime which he did in
the end commit, it really is of comparatively little importance whether the appellant
was truly reporting something which she had done, or falsely reporting something
which she merely pretended to do. I am not going to read them; it is not necessary;
but reference may, perhaps, be made to one of them, which is the last. By this time
Bywaters was back in this country. The appellant and Bywaters were meeting. They
had ample opportunity of conversation and arrangement of any plan in which they
might be interested; and upon the 2nd of October the appellant wrote to him – “I
tried so hard to ﬁnd a way out of to-night, darlingest, but he was suspicious and still
is. . . . We ought to be able to use great big things for great big love like ours.” And
again – “Darlint, it is funds that are our stumbling block – until we have those, we
can do nothing.” That is not the only passage in the later correspondence in which
the appellant refers to the importance of money. Then she goes on – “Darlint do
something to-morrow night will you? something to make you forget. I’ll be hurt I
know, but I want you to hurt me – I do really – the bargain now seems so one-sided –
so unfair – but how can I alter it.” And ﬁnally, the last passage – “Don’t forget what
we talked in the tearoom. I’ll still risk and try if you will – we only have 33/4 years left
darlingest.” Now, it cannot be said that those letters were not evidence against the
appellantinsupportofthechargewhichtheprosecutionweremakingupagainsther.
Taking that long summing up as a whole, and reading one part with the rest of
what the learned judge says, in the opinion of this Court it is not possible to found
upon it any unfavourable criticism. The case was clearly put before the jury. There
was simple evidence, partly direct evidence, partly evidence from which inference
might properly be drawn; and upon that evidence, in a case which exhibits from
beginning to end no redeeming feature, the members of the jury have convicted

conviction, and this appeal must be dismissed.

Examination of John Hancock
John Hancock, examined by Mr. Travers Humphreys – I am a detective
constable. I received a number of letters from Inspector Hall, which I examined
and had copied. There were also a number of newspaper cuttings in some of the
letters. On 9th October I found a knife (exhibit No. 1) in a drain on the north side
of Seymour Gardens, Ilford, about 250 yards from Kensington Gardens, Ilford. I
handed it to Inspector Hall. I did not ﬁnd any sheath. It is an English knife. I received
three letters from the witness Miss Jacobs (exhibits 14, 30, and 51). These letters are
signed by Bywaters. I searched the house at 41 Kensington Gardens, and I found a
bottle (exhibit 61) in a small drawer in Mr. and Mrs. Thompson’s bedroom. It has a
label, “Aromatic tincture of opium.” I handed the bottle to Mr. Webster, the analyst.
Cross-examined by Sir H. Curtis Bennett – Altogether I found 62 letters,
including telegrams, and of these 32 have been put in as exhibits in this case. In the
different letters there were some 50 enclosures, cuttings from newspapers, referring
to a variety of subjects. Of those cuttings about ten referred to cases which were
more or less in the public eye at the time. I have with me a list of the names of the
cuttings. It includes the following: –

Examination of Richard Sellars
Richard Sellars, examined by Mr. Travers Humphreys – I am a divi-
sional detective inspector of police, K. Division. At 11 a.m. on 4th October I saw
Mrs. Thompson at her house, 41 Kensington Gardens, Ilford. I said to her, “I am an
inspector of police. I understand you were with your husband early this morning
in Belgrave Road. I am satisﬁed he was assaulted and stabbed several times.” She
said, “We were coming along Belgrave Road, and just past the corner of Endsleigh
Gardens, when I heard him call out, ‘Oh-er,’ and he fell up against me. I put out
my arms to save him, and found blood, which I thought was coming from his
mouth. I tried to help him up. He staggered for several yards towards Kensington
Gardens, and then fell against the wall and slid down; he did not speak to me. I
cannot say if I spoke to him. I felt him, and found his clothing wet with blood.
He never moved after he fell. We had no quarrel on the way; we were quite happy
together. Immediately I saw blood I ran across the road to a doctor’s. I appealed
to a lady and gentleman who were passing, and the gentleman also went to the
doctor’s. The doctor came, and told me my husband was dead. Just before he fell
down I was walking on his right hand side, on the inside of the pavement, nearest
the wall. We were side by side. I did not see anybody about at the time. My husband
and I were talking about going to a dance.” At that time Mrs. Thompson was in an
agitated condition. About 7 p.m. on the same day I saw the prisoner Bywaters at
the Ilford police station, and took possession of the overcoat he was wearing, which
is the one now produced. I saw Mrs. Thompson again a little later in the same
evening, after she had made her ﬁrst statement to me, and I afterwards took her
to the Ilford police station. I spoke to her again on the next day, 5th October, and
asked her if she would give me any further information regarding her husband’s
assailant. She said, “I will tell you if I possibly can,” and she made a voluntary state-
ment which was typewritten, read, and signed (exhibit No. 3). That statement is as
follows: –

Analysis of Evidence
Statement of Edith Jessie Thompson
Edith Jessie Thompson, 41 Kensington Gardens, Ilford, age 28, married,
states –
My husband’s name is Percy Thompson. He is a shipping clerk employed by
Messrs. O. J. Parker & Co., Peel House, Eastcheap, E. C.
I am employed by Carlton & Prior, millinery manufacturers, 168 Aldersgate
Street, E.C., as a book-keeper. We have been married six years and have no family.
We were married in the beginning of the year 1916. In that year my husband
joined the London Scottish Regiment, he was discharged as medically unﬁt a few
months later and did no foreign service. I have always been on affectionate terms
with my husband. I remember Tuesday, 3rd October 1922. We both went to our
respective businesses that day. I met my husband by appointment at a quarter to
six, in Aldersgate Street, that day, we went to the Criterion Theatre, we there met
my uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. J. Laxton, we left the Theatre about 11 p.m., we
all four went to the Piccadilly Circus Tube, we there separated, my husband and I
went to Liverpool Street, and we caught the 11.30 train to Ilford, we arrived at Ilford
about 12 o’clock, we then proceeded along York Road, Belgrave Road and when we
got between De Vere and Endsleigh Gardens, (we were walking on the right hand
side) my husband suddenly went into the roadway, I went after him, and he fell
up against me, and called out “oo-er.” He was staggering, he was bleeding, and I
thought that the blood was coming from his mouth. I cannot remember whether
I saw anyone else there or not. I know there was none there when he staggered up
against me. I got hold of my husband with both hands and assisted him to get up
against the wall. He stood there for about a minute or two and then slid down on to
the footway, he never spoke, I fell on the ground with him. I cannot remember if I
shouted out or not. I got up off the ground and ran along to Courtland Avenue, with
the intention of calling Dr. Maudsley, but on the way I met a lady and a gentleman
and I said to them something to this effect, “Can I get a doctor or help me, my
husband is ill.” The gentleman said, “I will go for the doctor.” Dr. Maudsley arrived
shortly after, although it seemed a long time. The doctor examined my husband
and said that he was dead. An ambulance was sent for and the body was removed.
I was accompanied to my home by two Police Ofﬁcers.
I know Freddie Bywaters, I have known him for several years; we were at school
together, at least I wasn’t but my two brothers were. He is residing with his widowed
mother at 11 Westow St., Norwood. He is a ship’s writer and periodically goes away
to sea. He has been for a very long time on visiting terms with my family. In June,
1921, Bywaters came to reside with my husband and myself at No. 41 Kensington
Gardens. He came as a paying guest. I think he paid 25s. or 27s. 6d. per week. He
was with us up to the beginning of August, 1921. I remember August Bank Holiday,
1921. My husband and I quarrelled about something, he struck me. I knocked a
chair over. Freddie came in and interfered on my behalf. I left the room and I do
not know what transpired between them. As far as my recollection goes, Freddie
left on the following Friday, but before he left my husband and he were friends

again. We have been in the habit of corresponding with one another. His letters to
me and mine to him were couched in affectionate terms. I am not in possession of
any letters he writes to me. I have destroyed all as is customary with me with all
my correspondence. The letters shown to me by Inspector Hall and addressed to
Mr. F. Bywaters are some of the letters that I wrote to Freddie, and were written to
him without my husband’s consent. When he was at home in England, we were in
the habit of going out occasionally together without my husband’s knowledge.
This statement has been read over to me. It is voluntary and it is true.
(Sgd.) Edith Thompson
Examination of Richard Sellars, Continued
After making that statement, Mrs. Thompson and I left the room; I took her to the
matron’s room. In doing so we passed the library, where Bywaters was detained.
She saw him as she passed, and she said, “Oh, God; oh, God, what can I do? Why
did he do it? I did not want him to do it.” She further said almost immediately
after, “I must tell the truth.” She was hysterical, and I said, “You realise what you
are saying; what you might say may be used in evidence.” She then proceeded to
make a statement, which again was written down and signed (exhibit No. 4). It is as
follows: –

Examination of Richard Sellars, Continued
After taking Bywaters’ coat from him, it was examined by Dr. Drought, and after he
had examined it I said to Bywaters, “We shall detain you and retain possession of
your overcoat.” He said, “Why, I know nothing about it.” He commenced to speak
further, and I said, “If you wish to make a statement, it will be better to put it in
writing.” I cautioned him, and he made a statement which he signed in my presence
(exhibit No. 5).

Norwood, aged 20, Laundry Steward, states –
I have known Mr. Percy Thompson for about four years and his wife, Edith, for
about 7 years. Mr. Thompson is a shipping clerk; his wife is in a millinery business,
and they reside at 41 Kensington Gardens, Ilford. I stayed with them from June
18th, 1921, to the 1st August, 1921. The ﬁrst week that I was there, I was there as
