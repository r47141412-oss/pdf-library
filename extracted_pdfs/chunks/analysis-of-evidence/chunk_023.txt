Analysis of Evidence
lives revolving around church and school. That afternoon they were driving over
to Goshen, about 20 miles southeast, to a volleyball practice at the First Baptist
Church.
Judy was driving them in her new yellow Pinto – new to her, that is, for the
Ulrichs were the seventh owners of the 1973 model Ford. Earl Ulrich, a carpenter,
was helping his daughter pay for the used car as a sort of a high school graduation
present. The little car was good on gas, he ﬁgured when deciding to buy it, and it
was made by American workers, by gosh.
The girls left Osceola about 5:45 p.m., chattering about summer jobs and future
plans. Judy was working as a waitress at Farrell’s Ice Cream Parlor over in South
Bend. She aimed to enter a commercial college that fall to study interior design.
Donna was going to do volunteer church work. Lynn, a high school junior, was
working part time as a cashier at the Park and Shop Supermarket in Osceola. All
three were excited about going to South Dakota the next week for a Missionary
Church youth camp.
On the way, they stopped at the Checker Self-Serve gas station in Dunlap,
an unincorporated township, to ﬁll up. Then they headed on, laughing and
talking.
Likely no one knows for sure why the Ulrich girls turned around and headed
back towards home on Highway 33 – the stretch of ﬁve-lane blacktop between
Elkhart and Goshen. There was probably car trouble, for Judy had the Pinto’s red
emergency blinkers ﬂashing and the car was only going between 10 and 17 mph
in the right-hand lane. They might’ve wanted to get off the highway – which was
crowded with vacationers in motor homes – but they couldn’t. Eight-inch curbs
prevented any exit.
Suddenly, bearing down on them was a customized 1972 Chevy van – with a 350
cubic-inch engine, a “Peace Train” logo and mural of a train on the panels, and a
two-by-six wood plank for a bumper.
The Ulrich girls never saw the Chevy van.
Levi Hochstetler was out in the barn, settling in some new brooder chicks, when
he heard the noise. A tool-and-die maker by trade, Hochstetler is a bit of a farmer at
heart and works a lot in the outbuildings behind his rambling white house, which
sits alongside the railroad that runs parallel to Highway 3.
A crash startled him that August afternoon. Then came an explosion. He ran
to the roadside, but the thick black smoke kept him from seeing exactly what had
happened: He ran back to the barn and got a ﬁre extinguisher.
He could see the burning car when he got back. Inside a ring of groundﬁre, a
blackened body lay beside it.
“Help me! Oh, please help me!” pleaded the body that was Judy Ulrich.
Hochstetler saw that her foot was caught between the car door and rocker
panel. He tried to open the burning door but couldn’t. Then there was another
man there, pushing open the door with a stick. Hochstetler pulled the girl out of
the ﬁre.

“Thank you! Thank you!” Judy told him.
Only then did Hochstetler feel the throbbing in his hands. He looked and saw
them covered with second-degree burns. He had heard screams, horrible screams,
earlier, he remembered now. Perhaps they had come from onlookers.
James Fry, a Goshen ﬁreman, arrived with the rescue squad. He looked into the
blackened Pinto and saw a girl, Donna Ulrich, dead in the front seat. Only later
would he ﬁnd out that Lynn Ulrich was also dead in the crushed rear of the burned
car.
Withhispartner,hewenttoaidJudy.In14yearsonthejob,thegrayingpotbellied
ﬁreman had seen a lot of accidents, even people cut in two by a train. But never had
he seen anyone burned as badly as this girl.
An Elkhart ambulance arrived then, and sped off with the injured girl to the
bigger hospital there. But Judy Ulrich had burns over her entire body. She remained
lucid and alert, but her condition worsened. Doctors decided to take her to the burn
center at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Fort Wayne, 75 miles away.
Judy was awake and talking for most of the trip. The medical attendants with her
said she didn’t complain much about pain.
But she asked questions, ones they found hard to answer. “How’re Lynn and
Donna doing? Are they all right?” “Will this keep me from having children?” Then,
ﬁnally, “Am I going to die?”
Tears rolled down a male nurse’s cheeks as he listened to Wanda Lumpkin, the
other nurse, comfort the dying girl by quoting a scripture from the faith they shared.
“When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the
rivers, they shall not overﬂow thee.”
“When thou walkest through the ﬁre, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the
ﬂame kindle upon thee.”
“For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy one of Israel, thy Savior.”
Questions
The excerpt comes from a newspaper story about the criminal prosecution of the
Ford Motor Company for reckless homicide based upon their allegedly having sold
Pintos with knowledge that their gas tanks were likely to explode if the car was struck
in the rear. Consider the excerpt as part of an opening (or a closing) statement in
a wrongful death action by the Ulrichs against the owner and driver of the Chevy
van and the Ford Motor Company.
1 From the standpoint of plaintiff’s counsel: Who are the witnesses and what other
evidence will be necessary to support this statement of the “facts”? Are there any
assertions that appear to be incapable of proof; that is, assertions for which no
evidential data could be offered that would support the assertion as a reasonable
inference? Identify them. Are there any facts of which the court might take or permit
the jury to take judicial notice? Identify them.

Analysis of Evidence
2 From the standpoint of defense counsel: Assuming plaintiff’s counsel begins with the
assertion, “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, here is what I think the evidence will
show (has shown),” are there any valid bases for objecting to this statement or any
parts of it? What parts are objectionable and on what bases?
3 The statement does not include facts suggesting why Ford Motor Company should be
held responsible. Assume that you have experts who will testify, and documents
showing Ford’s engineers knew, that at an additional cost of $25 per unit Ford could
have installed a buffer between the rear bumper and the gas tank that would have
reduced the probability from one in ten to one in 50 that the gas tank would have
exploded from a comparable impact. Assume also that such buffers were known to
federal regulatory authorities, but were not required by applicable standards and were
not generally installed by United States auto manufacturers. Invent additional facts
that seem plausible inferences. In a two-paragraph statement of the facts, using Mr.
Dart’s style, supplement his statement to show the jury why Ford should be held
liable.
4 Assume that Dart’s story (with your two-paragraph addition) was told to the jury by
counsel for the plaintiff as the opening statement. Assume that each of the following
propositions is a statement of law the court will include in the instruction to the jury:
i In order for the manufacturer of an automobile to be liable for the death of
another, the jury must ﬁnd:
a That the automobile or its components were defectively designed,
manufactured, or assembled; and
b That, but for the speciﬁc defect in the design, manufacture, or assembly of the
particular automobile or component the death would not have occurred.
ii In order to ﬁnd that an automobile or a component thereof was defectively
designed, the jury must ﬁnd that the manufacturer knew or should have known at
the time the automobile was assembled:
a That the automobile or component was capable of causing signiﬁcant injury if
improperly designed; and
b That a design for the automobile or component was available and could be
employed at a non-prohibitive cost that would have materially reduced the
probability that an injury would occur or that the consequences from such an
injury would be so severe.
iii In determining whether a design was defective, the jury may consider industry
practices and any federal safety standards applicable in the automobile
manufacturing industry at the time as evidence of the state of the art in such
designs.
a Prepare a key-list and a chart showing the strategic ultimate and penultimate
probanda (i.e., through step 3) that you believe counsel for plaintiff should
attempt to prove.
b Translate your analysis into a brief (preferably one paragraph) statement of the
logical theory plaintiff’s counsel would be applying if he or she adopted your
key-list and chart.
5 Story and theme: Dart’s story is both dramatic and coherent. Identify ﬁve background
generalizations he used or on which his story depends. Identify the characteristics that

two of the principal witnesses would have to demonstrate on the stand (if they were to
be consistent with the characterizations the story has suggested).
6 The defense. Using the same assumptions and assuming in addition that the defense
witnesses will be credible and capable characters: (a) Prepare a key-list and chart of
the strategic ultimate and penultimate probanda you would use for the defense theory.
(b) Translate your analysis into a brief (preferably one paragraph) statement of the
logical theory defense counsel would be using if your analysis were adopted.
7 Story and theme: Prepare a brief opening statement consistent with your theory that
develops the most favorable story and themes that Ford might reasonably attempt to
establish.
8 Assume the trial was to take place primarily in Elkhart, Indiana, mid-size city.
D. Two more complex trial problems
1. Introduction
The two trial problems that follow are based upon problems developed for the
National Trial Competition in the United States in 1981 (Wainwright) and 1982
(Warren). They provide material suitable for a culminating exercise in a course
that focuses upon analysis of evidence for potential trial lawyers. (In the appended
materials, dates should be advanced to make the problems current.)
The suggested exercise has four parts – the preparation of a complete key-list and
chartforoneoftheproblems,thedevelopmentofacompletetrialbookbasedonthat
analysis, the trial of the case so prepared, and the preparation of a post-trial critique.
The following guidelines illustrate how the full exercise could be implemented.
1 Students undertaking the exercise would form two-person law ﬁrms, and each ﬁrm
would choose (or be assigned) to represent one of the parties in one of the problems
and to serve assigned roles as witnesses for one side in the other problem.
2 Each ﬁrm would analyze the evidence in light of the law given in the jury instructions
and develop a complete key-list and chart for the case from the standpoint of lawyers
preparing for trial.
3 Each ﬁrm would prepare a trial book containing all components speciﬁed above at
pages 318–23. The preliminary memorandum should refer to propositions on the
key-list as well as the appropriate portions of the record and should explain the theory
and themes adopted in light of the possibilities identiﬁed by the chart. The “script” for
anticipated direct and cross of each witness should identify the proposition(s) on the
key-list that each testimonial assertion is intended to support (or confound), and each
document or other item of real evidence should be similarly indexed to the key-list.
4 Each ﬁrm would then try its case to a jury composed of other members of the class
under the following rules:
a Witness preparation. Witnesses should know their statements thoroughly and be
familiar with the entire record. Of necessity, each witness will have to make
inferences with respect to relevant facts not adequately speciﬁed in the statements.
Witnesses should attempt, within the bounds of fairness and integrity, to draw

342
Analysis of Evidence
inferences favorable to the theory that counsel for their side of the case are
attempting to develop. In pre-trial preparation, counsel may suggest plausible
inferences by the use of leading questions, but they are bound by the witness’s
responses. On cross-examination, the witness must reveal any instructions
received from counsel in preparation. Opposing counsel may not, however, object
to any testimony on the ground that it is not in the statement or the record.
b Other evidence and law. No real or demonstrative evidence other than that
contained in the problem (or provided by the instructor as a supplement) may be
used. Pre-trial stipulations and rulings and the jury instructions set forth in the
record may not be challenged, although legal arguments may be advanced during
trial to support particular constructions where appropriate.
c Motions. No written motions will be received, and preliminary oral motions will
be looked upon with disfavor. No rights or objections are waived by failure to
present them before the trial commences.
d Division of responsibility. Each side shall call its two designated witnesses during its
case-in-chief. (Only if adequate time remains and the presiding judge is satisﬁed
that the interests of justice will be served thereby, may the other side’s witnesses
thereafter be called as additional and adverse witnesses.) Each member of the ﬁrm
will conduct the direct examination of one of its designated witnesses and the
cross-examination of one of the other side’s designated witnesses. The one
member who conducts the direct or cross-examination is responsible for
responding to and making objections to exhibits and testimony offered through
that witness as appropriate. One member of the ﬁrm shall open; the other shall
close. Each planned motion made during trial, for a directed verdict or the like,
shall be argued only by the member of the ﬁrm who makes it.
e The trial: order and time allotments for proceedings17
i Opening statements. Each side shall give an opening statement that may not
exceed ﬁve minutes.
ii Case-in-chief. Each side shall have an aggregate of not more than 30 minutes,
including time devoted to arguments on motions or objections and to the
introduction and publication of documents and other evidence, to present its
case-in-chief.
iii Cross-examination. Cross-examination of each witness may not exceed ten
minutes, including time devoted to arguments on motions or objections.
iv Rebuttal evidence. Ordinarily, rebuttal evidence will not be permitted. If the
plaintiff or prosecution has time remaining from its case-in-chief and if the
presiding judge concludes that fairness so requires, rebuttal may be permitted.
This should be done only in the exceptional case where the plaintiff’s or the
prosecution’s counsel have been unfairly surprised because evidence has been
offered by the defense that could not reasonably have been anticipated.
17 Based upon one of the authors’ extensive experience in coaching teams for the competition, these
time limits are more than adequate for well-prepared teams. The time allotments speciﬁed in the
National Trial Competition Rules are more generous: ten minutes for opening statements; forty-
ﬁve minutes for each side’s case-in-chief; ﬁfteen minutes for cross-examination of each witness;
plaintiff’s rebuttal, time remaining; and closings, ten minutes for each side.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
343
v Closing. Each side shall give a closing argument that may not exceed ten
minutes. Counsel for the plaintiff or prosecution may reserve up to ﬁve minutes
of that allotment for rebuttal argument.
vi Verdict. The jury should attempt to reach a verdict, and thereafter counsel and
the jury should discuss the case. The nature of this discussion should reﬂect the
fact that the jurors are Wigmoreans.
5 Each ﬁrm should prepare a post-trial memorandum critiquing the analysis and the
theory, story, themes that they developed before trial in view of their effectiveness at
trial and should specify what changes they would make in preparing a similar case in
the future.
2. The criminal case: United States v. Wainwright
IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE TERRITORY OF COLUMBIA
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
VS.
CRIM. NO. C-XX-001

Indictment
THE GRAND JURY CHARGES:
Count One
On or about October 19, last year, within the Territory of Columbia, on land under
the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, the Defendant, Horace Wainwright,
did, with malice aforethought, unlawfully shoot and kill Terry Dobbs with a gun.
(Violation, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1111.)

having knowledge of such circumstances as could reasonably be said to have made
foreseeable to him the peril to which his acts might subject others, did unlawfully

A TRUE BILL
/s/ Lucius Coleman
FOREMAN, GRAND JURY
Stipulations
The Government and the Defendant agree and stipulate as follows:
1 The Court has full and complete jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties.
For purposes of this Competition, the Territory of Columbia is a location within the
exclusive, special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. No issue
will be raised concerning the applicability of federal law to this case. The subject
incident occurred within the Territory of Columbia.
2 No issue will be raised concerning the sufﬁciency of the indictment.
3 No Speedy Trial Act questions are involved in this case, and none will be considered or
raised.
4 Each witness statement was given under circumstances where the penalty of perjury
would apply.
5 Prior to making any statement, the Defendant was given all appropriate warnings and
was fully advised of his rights.
6 Dr. Joseph Jiminez is the chief medical examiner, duly licensed and qualiﬁed to
determine the cause of death. The doctor, if present, would testify under oath that he
performed an autopsy on the deceased who died as a result of a .44 caliber gunshot
wound to the chest. The bullet entered in the area of the heart, went slightly
downward, straight into the body from front to back, and struck the heart killing the
deceased immediately. Because there was no powder residue on deceased or his
clothes, the gun had to be at least 20′′ from the deceased when it was ﬁred. The
deceased had a blood alcohol content of 0.15 or 1.5 times the 0.10 level at which all
experts and the medical profession agree is the standard recognized level of
intoxication. In other words, anyone who reaches 0.10 will be intoxicated regardless of
their individual tolerance. The deceased was in excellent health. There were no other
wounds. The bullet was recovered from the heart and turned over to Special Agent
Kelso.
Statement of Harold Clark
My name is Harold Clark. I attend the University of Columbia where I am majoring
in management. I am 21 years old and in my third year of college. Last night I picked
up my friend, Carlos Blanca, a foreign student who plans to return to Spain, where
his home is. Also, I picked up Terry “Bull” Dobbs and took him to the Octoberfest.
We all called him “Bull” because he was short and well built. I picked up Terry at
his home. We were good friends. We went to the Beer Garten and had a few beers.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
345
I think I had four or ﬁve. Actually it could have been seven or eight. I took my own
mug. We saw three girls whom we knew and bought them a few beers and were
taking them home to their sorority house. On the way, I told them that I knew of
this eccentric old man that lived at the end of the street. I grew up just a few blocks
away in a much poorer area. The word was this old fellow was about half crazy
and scared to death and kept building fences and stuff to keep people out of his
yard. I thought it would be fun just to drive by and show them where he lived. We
went down Trails End Road and drove around the cul-de-sac. Bull said, “let’s don’t
bother him.” This was after I may have yelled something like “Hey old man, how is
everything in your stockade tonight?” Then we left and took the girls home.
After we took the girls home, I said, “let’s go back there just for fun.” It was about
2:30 a.m. and we really weren’t going to do anything bad. My Spanish friend was
sitting in the right front seat and Bull was seated directly behind me. I was driving.
We drove around the cul-de-sac one or two times. I don’t remember anybody yelling
anything. The old man came out so we stopped in front of the house next door to
see what he would do. He opened the gate and came toward us. He had a ﬂashlight
in his hand and I couldn’t see what else he was holding. It never occurred to me
that he had a gun. However, as he got close to the car he said, “What are you punks
doing here? I may show you young whippersnappers a thing or two.” Bull said,
“He’s got a gun.” I quickly reached over to put the car in ﬁrst gear. The car has a
four-on-the-ﬂoor gearshift. About that time I was hit real hard up side my head. I
heard a loud sound. Somebody yelled “let’s get out of here.” The next thing I knew
I was driving down the street, and Carlos said, “Bull’s been shot and I think he’s
dead.” I guess he was dead. He never moved or said anything. I went straight to the
hospital, which was not too far away, and from there we called the police and told
them what had happened.
I don’t know if the old man meant to shoot and kill Terry or not. I do know that
he hit me plenty hard and I was dazed pretty good while I was driving away. In fact,
there is still a big scar on my head. He must have wanted to hurt me pretty bad by
hitting me so hard. I don’t know why he would do this. None of us really knew him
and we hadn’t done anything but drive down to the end of the street like lots of
other people I know. In fact, we were in my car in the street. We weren’t even on his
property.
I feel real bad about what happened. Bull’s father was a police ofﬁcer and was shot
and killed last year by a robber. Bull worked part time to help support his mother.
He was a straight “A” student and was getting ready to graduate with a music degree.
He never hurt a ﬂy and was the nicest guy I knew. After he drank a few beers that
night, he was as friendly as I have ever seen him. In fact, he didn’t want to go down
to the end of the street either time. Once he said, “let’s just leave the old man alone.”
This is really all I know.

Offense Report of Special Agent Kelso
I was working homicide in the district that includes Trails End Road during the
night shift on October 19, last year. I have been a homicide special agent for ten
years and have worked this area during all that time. I know the neighborhood
very well, and I am familiar with many of the people that live there. At 3:20 a.m.,
while cruising the area, I received a call to go to 10 Trails End Road to question a
Mr. Wainwright, whom I knew, about a shooting. As I got to the door, Mr. Wain-
wright was getting ready to leave his house. I immediately asked him what had
occurred and he told me he accidentally shot his gun when a boy, who was in a car
and who had driven to his house several times that night, went for a weapon. In fact
I said, “A young man is dead, he was shot, do you know anything about this?” He
said, “Yes, I must have done it, my gun went off when I was protecting myself from
the driver who was going for a weapon. I didn’t mean to hurt anybody.”
I later talked to the driver, Harold Clark. I examined his car and his tires matched
perfectly the fresh skid marks in the cul-de-sac as well as the tire tracks in the ditch.
My diagram shows where the car was parked in relation to Mr. Wainwright’s gate.
I took a statement from Mr. Wainwright and what he said about the past shoot-
ings at his house is true. I saw his window and the speaker at his gate after they
were shot out. Also, I know he called the police a lot about cars coming up to his
property.
I found no weapon on any of the boys or in the Pontiac. The Pontiac has a four
speedﬂoorshift.Theboy,Clark,wascoherent,butwalkedalittleunsteadily,smelled
ofbeerandprobablywasintoxicated.Hehadbeendrinking.Mr.Wainwrightturned
over the gun. It was a .44 caliber pistol. The bullet from the autopsy was the same
as the remaining bullets in the gun. There was one empty hull.
Mr. Wainwright’s gun is a “single action” revolver. Ordinarily, to ﬁre it you must
ﬁrst cock the hammer and then pull the trigger. Of course, if you pulled the trigger
back and held it and the hammer was moved back and then fell closed, the gun
would ﬁre. The gun can be ﬁred with the hammer closed, but it takes a terriﬁc blow
to the hammer. I tested it. I am also very familiar with all types of pistols and their
operation. In my opinion, the hammer must have been cocked when the gun ﬁred
and Mr. Wainwright’s ﬁnger must have been inside the trigger guard.
Mr. Wainwright is old. He has never been in any trouble before from his criminal
history. Neither the deceased nor the driver had any criminal record or previous
arrests. The Spanish boy spoke little English and was to return to Spain the next
week. He was ﬁnishing up a thesis for a masters degree in French at the University.

Statement of Sally Williams
My name is Sally Williams. I live at 34 Trails End Road. I am a retired school teacher.
I live alone. I am 58 years old.
Last night I was sleeping in my upstairs front bedroom. It was a cool night, but I
had the window open. Some time after midnight I saw a small foreign car come up
to the cul-de-sac and go around the circle very fast. The car returned about thirty
minutes later and did this again. I must have gone back to sleep. Around 2:00 a.m.
I saw a white car come up that looked like a two-door sports model. I think it was
a Pontiac. The car went around the cul-de-sac one time squealing its tires. I heard
one of the male occupants yell, “Hey you old goat, what if we ran through that silly
looking fence?”, or something like that. Something else may have been said. I just
don’t remember. I heard a noise like metal hitting metal.
Then sometime about 3:00 a.m. (I looked at my clock) I saw the same kind of
car come to a stop in the little ditch in my front yard. I just stayed by my front
window and looked out. Then I saw my neighbor, Mr. Wainwright, open the gate
and come toward the car. It looked like he had something in his right hand. I know
he was carrying a ﬂashlight in his left hand because it was turned on. He walked
up to the car and said something to the effect of, “What are you doing here.” One
of the boys said something. I can’t remember what, but he was very belligerent. I
am sure of that. The car was facing outward toward the street, and I couldn’t see
what happened next, but I heard a gun discharge. Then someone said, “Let’s go
quick,” and the car spun a lot of mud and came ﬂying out onto the street. Then
Mr. Wainwright looked around the neighborhood and walked back to his gate. I
don’t know what happened next. I guess I should have called the police, but I did
not know that anybody had been shot. Besides, I have heard shots ﬁred around the
end of the street on several previous occasions.
Mr. Wainwright’s wife used to be a friend of mine, but since she died he sort of
stays to himself. It seems like he is always building a big fence or putting lights out
there or some kind of gadget on his gate. He seems like a nice old man, but he really
doesn’t have much to say. I have never known him to do anything violent or wrong
before and he has got a good reputation for being a peaceable citizen. He doesn’t
like kids or anyone driving around his home at night. He is always complaining
about that.
I also wish people would quit racing around that cul-de-sac late at night. Some-
times, it keeps me awake. I don’t know of any of the other neighbors that have
been shot at or had their houses shot at, but Mr. Wainwright did show me where

his home had been ﬁred into once and also where his fence was broken by a car
running over it.
I don’t know any of the boys in the car. I did hear one boy say, “Come on, let’s
go, let’s leave the old geezer alone.” This was when the car was in the ditch maybe
one minute before Mr. Wainwright walked out. This is really all I know, heard, or
saw that night.

Statement of Horace Wainwright
My name is Horace Wainwright. I am a white male, age 73. I live alone at 10 Trails
End Road. My wife died last year, and I am a widower. We bought this house two
years ago because we wanted privacy and by living at the end of this dead end
street in this wooded neighborhood, we thought we could enjoy my ﬁnal years of
retirement in the same general area where we were both raised. Although the overall
neighborhood has deteriorated, our street is nice and well kept.
Soon after we purchased our home, we found that kids and adults liked to drive
their cars at night to the cul-de-sac at our property entrance. They would drive
up and couples would park, kids would relieve themselves, and sometimes the kids
drove all over my yard. They would honk and yell bad things. They made me mad
and I installed a 6′ cyclone fence. After this they would still drive up and honk and
yell obscenities. About a year and a half ago, one guy drove through my fence. Then,
about one year ago, someone ﬁred a riﬂe through the downstairs kitchen window
while we were asleep. I then installed lights in my trees, an automatic gate with a
lock, and a speaker phone at the entrance.
Maybe around Christmas, some kids ﬁred some more shots. My wife had a heart
attack the day after and died in the hospital two months later. Just last August,
someone shot out my speaker phone with a shotgun, and one of my lights was shot
out one month ago.
I have lived in fear and the police have been called many times. In fact, Special
Agent Kelso, who I am giving this statement to, works this area and investigated
most of these shootings.
Tonight, like many weekend nights, it started back again. At 1:00 a.m. a car
drove up and ran into my fence. It was the same car the dead boy was later in. I
ran out and saw that it was a white Pontiac two-door sports car. It bent my fence,
but didn’t break it. The car came back two or three more times and spun its tires
and went around and around the cul-de-sac. The guys yelled obscenities. I heard
them call me a “dirty old s.o.b.” and one said, “We’ll just come over this pissant

fence you old lush.” They left the next to last time around 2:30 a.m. At 3:00 a.m.
they came back and spun the wheels and honked so I got my old long tom .44
pistol called a thumb buster. It’s a single action revolver and the only gun I have.
“Single action” means that ordinarily the hammer must be cocked before you pull
the trigger to ﬁre. I went out to ask them to leave and scare them. I noticed their
car parked in the ditch of my neighbor’s yard, I guess 50′ from my front gate. I
walked up to the car to get the license number. Someone in the car said, “Hey
ﬁnk face, you want to have some fun?” I said, “Get out of here.” My hand was
trembling.
The driver had his hands on the wheel and then he suddenly reached for some-
thing between the seats with his right hand. I thought he grabbed a weapon. I
had a ﬂashlight in my left hand turned on him. The gun was in my right hand.
I don’t think the hammer was cocked. I didn’t want to shoot him so I hit him in
the head with the barrel of the pistol. I guess the gun went off right then. There
were three boys in the car. The passenger in front yelled, “Get out of here, he shot
Bull.”
The car dug out of the ditch and left real fast. I went back to the house. I didn’t
know what to do. Finally about 3:30 a.m., I put on my pants and coat and was going
to drive to the police sub-station and tell them what happened. As I walked to my
car Special Agent Kelso was coming up the walk, so here I am. I don’t think I knew
any of the three men in the car. I do know they came to my house many times that
night.
I have read the above statement and it is true and correct.

Court’s Instructions to the Jury
Members of the Jury:
You have now heard all of the evidence in the case as well as the ﬁnal arguments
of the lawyers for the parties. You, as jurors, are the judges of the facts. But in
determining what actually happened in this case, that is, in reaching your decision
as to the facts, it is your sworn duty to follow the law I am now in the process of
deﬁning for you.
The indictment or formal charge against a Defendant is not evidence of guilt.
Indeed, the Defendant is presumed by the law to be innocent. The law does not
require a Defendant to prove his innocence or produce any evidence at all. The
Government has the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and
if it fails to do so you must acquit him. But, while the Government’s burden of proof

Analysis of Evidence
is a strict or heavy burden, it is not necessary that the Defendant’s guilt be proved
beyond all possible doubt. It is only required that the Government’s proof exclude
any “reasonable doubt” concerning the Defendant’s guilt.
A“reasonabledoubt”isarealdoubt,baseduponreasonandcommonsense,after
careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case. Proof beyond a
reasonable doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that you would
be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of your
own affairs. If you are convinced that the accused has been proved guilty beyond
reasonable doubt, say so. If you are not convinced, say so.
While you should consider only the evidence in the case, you are permitted
to draw such reasonable inferences from the testimony and exhibits as you feel
are justiﬁed in the light of common experience. In other words, you may make
deductionsandreachconclusionswhichreasonandcommonsenseleadyoutodraw
fromthefactswhichhavebeenestablishedbythetestimonyandevidenceinthecase.
You may also consider either direct or circumstantial evidence. “Direct evidence” is
the testimony of one who asserts actual knowledge of a fact, such as an eyewitness.
“Circumstantial evidence” is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances indicating
eithertheguiltorinnocenceoftheDefendant.Thelawmakesnodistinctionbetween
the weight to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence. It requires only
that you weigh all of the evidence and be convinced of the Defendant’s guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt before he can be convicted.
It is charged in Count One of the indictment that on or about October 19, last
year, in the Territory of Columbia, the Defendant, Horace Wainwright, with malice
aforethought, and by means of shooting, unlawfully killed Terry Dobbs, in violation
of Title 18, Section 1111 of the United States Code. Section 1111 of Title 18 of the
United States Code declares, in part, that:
“Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.”
Iftheactofkillingisdonewithapremeditatedintentwillfullytotakeahumanlife,
the offense is murder in the ﬁrst degree. If the act is done without such premeditated
intent, the offense is murder in the second degree. You will note that the indict-
ment contains no allegation that the Defendant acted with premeditation. Conse-
quently, the offense charged is that of murder in the second degree. Two essential
elements are required to be proved in order to establish the offense of second-degree
murder:
First, the act or acts of killing a human being unlawfully;
Second, doing such act or acts with malice aforethought.
“Unlawfully” means contrary to law. So, to do an act “unlawfully” means to do
willfully something which is contrary to law and without legal justiﬁcation. An act
is done “willfully,” if it is done voluntarily and intentionally, and with the speciﬁc
intent to do something the law forbids; that is to say, with bad purpose either to
disobey or to disregard the law.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint

“Malice aforethought” means an intent, at the time of a killing, willfully to take
thelifeofahumanbeing,oranintentwillfullytoactincallousandwantondisregard
of the consequences to human life; but “malice aforethought” does not necessarily
imply any ill will, spite, or hatred towards the individual killed. “Malice,” as the
term is used here, is but another name for a certain state or condition of a person’s
mind or heart. Since no one can look into the heart of another, the only means of
determining whether or not malice existed at the time of a killing is by inference
drawn from the surrounding facts and circumstances, as shown by the evidence in
the case. If it is shown that the Defendant used a deadly weapon in the commission
of a homicide, then you may ﬁnd, from the use of such weapon, in the absence of
mitigating circumstances, the existence of the malice which is an essential element
of the offense. You are not obliged so to ﬁnd, however.
The law permits the jury to ﬁnd the accused guilty of any lesser offense which
is necessarily included in the crime charged in the indictment, whenever such a
course is consistent with the facts found by the jury from the evidence in the case,
and with the law as given in the instructions of the Court. So, if the jury should
unanimously ﬁnd the accused “not guilty” of the crime charged in Count One of
the indictment, then the jury must proceed to determine the guilt or innocence
of the accused as to any lesser offense which is necessarily included in the crime
charged.
The crime of murder in the second degree, which is charged in Count One
of the indictment in this case, necessarily includes the lesser offense of volun-
tary manslaughter. Section 1112(a), Title 18 of the United States Code deﬁnes
manslaughter as follows: “Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being
without malice . . . : Voluntary – Upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.” Two
essential elements are required to be proved in order to establish the offense of
voluntary manslaughter:
First:
The act or acts of killing a human being;
Second:
The doing of such act or acts voluntarily and without legal justiﬁcation
or excuse.
If the jury should unanimously ﬁnd the accused “not guilty” of both the crime of
murderintheseconddegreeandthelesserincludedoffenseofvoluntarymanslaugh-
ter, then the jury must proceed to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused
as to Count Two of the indictment, which charges that he is guilty of involun-
tary manslaughter in that on or about October 19, [last year], in the Territory of
Columbia, the Defendant, Horace Wainwright, while engaged in the commission
of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, to wit, the assault of Harold Clark
by striking Clark’s head with a gun, did, unlawfully shoot and kill Terry Dobbs
with such gun, in violation of Title 18, Section 1112(a) of the United States Code.
Section 1112(a) provides in part: “Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human
being without malice . . . : Involuntary – In the commission of an unlawful act not
amounting to a felony . . . ”

Analysis of Evidence
Two essential elements are required to be proved in order to establish the offense
of involuntary manslaughter charged in Count Two of the indictment.
First:
The act or acts of killing a human being unlawfully;
Second:
Doing such act or acts while engaged in the commission of an unlawful
act not amounting to a felony.
You are instructed that Title 18, Section 113(a)(4) of the United States Code
prescribes punishment for the commission of (1) assault by striking, beating, or
wounding. The punishment prescribed is less than the minimum punishment pre-
scribed for the commission of a felony. Consequently, assault by striking, beating,
or wounding and simple assault are unlawful acts not amounting to a felony within
the meaning of Title 18, Section 1112(a) of the United States Code. If a person
actually strikes a blow while committing an assault, the offense is that of assault by
striking. This offense requires neither a particular degree of severity in the injury
inﬂicted nor the speciﬁc intent to cause serious injury. However, the prosecution
must establish the absence of just cause or excuse for the Defendant’s conduct if
evidence of just cause or excuse is presented.
If the jury should unanimously ﬁnd the accused “not guilty” under Count
Two of the indictment, then the jury must proceed to determine the guilt or
innocence of the accused as to Count Three of the indictment. It is charged in
Count Three of the indictment that on or about October 19, last year, within
the Territory of Columbia, the Defendant, Horace Wainwright, while engaged in
the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, that is confronting
Harold Clark, Terry Dobbs and Carlos Blanca with a gun, without due caution and
circumspection, and through gross negligence, unlawfully shot and killed Terry
Dobbs, in violation of Title 18, Section 1112 of the United States Code. Section
1112(a) also provides: “Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being
without malice . . . : Involuntary . . . in the commission in an unlawful manner, or
without due caution and circumspection, of a lawful act which might produce
death.”
Threeessentialelementsarerequiredtobeprovedinordertoestablishtheoffense
charged in Count Three of the indictment.
First:
The act or acts of killing a human being unlawfully;
Second:
Doing such act or acts while engaged in the commission of a
lawful act which might produce death, without due caution and
circumspection;
Third:
Actual knowledge of the Defendant that his conduct was a threat to the
lives of others, or knowledge of such circumstances as could
reasonably be said to have made foreseeable to him the peril to
which his acts might subject others.
The term “without due caution and circumspection” is equivalent to the term
“gross negligence.” Gross negligence means more than ordinary simple negligence.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
355
Gross negligence requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a wanton or reckless
disregard for human life.
With regard to all counts of the indictment, you are instructed as follows:
In this case, the Defendant has relied in part upon the defense of self-defense.
If the Defendant was not the aggressor, and had reasonable grounds to believe and
actually did believe that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm
from which he could save himself only by using deadly force against his assailant,
he had the right to employ force, including deadly force in order to defend himself.
By “deadly force” is meant force that is likely to cause death or serious bodily harm.
In order for the Defendant to have been justiﬁed in the use of force or deadly force
in self-defense, he must not have provoked the assault on him or have been the
aggressor. Mere words, without more, do not constitute provocation or aggression.
The circumstances under which he acted must have been such as to produce in
the mind of a reasonably prudent person, similarly situated, the reasonable belief
that the other person was then about to kill him or to do him serious bodily harm.
In addition, the Defendant must have actually believed that he was in imminent
danger of death or serious bodily harm and that deadly force must be used to
repel it.
If evidence of self-defense is present, the Government must prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the Defendant did not act in self-defense. If you ﬁnd that the
Government has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant did
not act in self-defense, you must ﬁnd the Defendant not guilty. In other words, if
you have a reasonable doubt whether or not the Defendant acted in self-defense,
your verdict must be not guilty.
If the Defendant had reasonable grounds to believe and actually did believe that
he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm and that deadly force
was necessary to repel such danger, he would be justiﬁed in using deadly force in
self-defense, even though it may afterwards have turned out that the appearances
were false. If these requirements are met he could use deadly force even though
there was in fact neither purpose on the part of the other person to kill him or do
him serious bodily harm, nor imminent danger that it would be done, nor actual
necessity that deadly force be used in self-defense.
If the Defendant had reasonable grounds to believe and actually did believe that
he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm and that deadly force
was necessary to repel such danger, he was not required to retreat or to consider
whether he could safely retreat. He was entitled to stand his ground and use such
force as was reasonably necessary under the circumstances to save his life or protect
himself from serious bodily harm. However, if the Defendant could have safely
retreated but did not do so, his failure to retreat is a circumstance which you may
consider, together with all other circumstances, in determining whether he went
farther in repelling the danger, real or apparent, than he was justiﬁed in doing under
the circumstances.
