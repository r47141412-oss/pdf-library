Analysis of Evidence
“I thought it was something like that,” said Nicky. “But you’re wrong about its being
a coincidence. It can’t be. Where did you get that sentence?”
“It was just a sentence. It simply popped into my head.”
“It couldn’t have! It’s not the sort of sentence that pops into one’s head. If you had
taught composition as long as I have, you’d know that when you ask someone for a
sentence of ten words or so, you get an ordinary statement such as ‘I like milk’ – with
the other words made up by a modifying clause like, ‘because it is good for my health.’
The sentence you offered related to a particular situation.”
“But I tell you I talked to no one this morning. And I was alone with you at the Blue
Moon.”
“You weren’t with me all the time I paid my check,” he said sharply. “Did you meet
anyone while you were waiting on the sidewalk for me to come out of the Blue Moon?”
I shook my head. “I was outside for less than a minute before you joined me. You
see, a couple of men came in while you were digging out your change and one of them
bumped me, so I thought I’d wait –”
“Did you ever see them before?”
“Who?”
“The two men who came in,” he said, the note of exasperation creeping into his
voice again.
“Why, no – they weren’t anyone I knew.”
“Were they talking?”
“I guess so. Yes, they were. Quite absorbed in their conversation, as a matter of fact –
otherwise, they would have noticed me and I would not have been bumped.”
“Not many strangers come into the Blue Moon,” he remarked.
“Do you think it was they?” I asked eagerly. “I think I’d know them again if I saw
them.”
Nicky’s eyes narrowed. “It’s possible. There had to be two – one to trail the victim in
Washington and ascertain his berth number, the other to wait here and do the job. The
Washington man would be likely to come down here afterwards. If there was theft as
well as murder, it would be to divide the spoils. If it was just murder, he would probably
have to come down to pay off his confederate.”
I reached for the telephone.
“We’ve been gone less than half an hour,” Nicky went on. “They were just coming in
and service is slow at the Blue Moon. The one who walked all the way to Hadley must
certainly be hungry and the other probably drove all night from Washington.”
“Call me immediately if you make an arrest,” I said into the phone and hung up.
Neither of us spoke a word while we waited. We paced the ﬂoor, avoiding each other
almost as though we had done something we were ashamed of.
The telephone rang at last. I picked it up and listened. Then I said, “O.K.” and turned
to Nicky.
“One of them tried to escape through the kitchen but Winn had someone stationed
at the back and they got him.”
“That would seem to prove it,” said Nicky with a frosty little smile.
I nodded agreement.

He glanced at his watch. “Gracious,” he exclaimed, “I wanted to make an early start
on my work this morning, and here I’ve already wasted all this time talking with you.”
I let him get to the door. “Oh, Nicky,” I called, “what was it you set out to prove?”
“That a chain of inferences could be logical and still not be true,” he said.
“Oh.”
“What are you laughing at?” he asked snappishly. And then he laughed too.
Questions
1 “The Nine Mile Walk” is a nice example of imaginative reasoning leading to the
construction of a hypothetical scenario of the events surrounding the murder on the
Washington Flier. Assume that A and B are the men who have been arrested and that
C was the victim. Restate Welt’s conclusion in the form of a story starting at the New
Sumter Inn and ending with the meeting at the Blue Moon Caf´e. Is the story
plausible? Given Kemelman’s account, what odds might a rational betting person
calculate as the likelihood that it was either A or B who murdered C?
2 Welt infers: “It is the man who said: ‘A nine mile walk is no joke, especially in the rain’
in the Blue Moon Caf´e this morning who is the person who murdered C.” For
Kemelman, this may be critical.
a How does Welt support the inference that the statement was made?
b How does he support the inference that it was made in the Caf´e that morning?
c Assume that Kemelman’s recollection does not improve. In most jurisdictions, the
two men would be entitled to a preliminary hearing to determine whether the
evidence shows that there was and is probable cause to believe that the two men
are responsible for the murder of C sufﬁcient to justify their (i) arrest and
(ii) prosecution. Could the prosecution prove that either of the men arrested
made the statement? Absent evidence that either of the men made the statement,
could the prosecution show that the police had probable cause to arrest the two
men?
3 Two men, A and B, have been arrested on suspicion of the murder of C. B is the one
who left the Blue Moon by the rear. He was unarmed. Assume that one will be
charged as principal; the other as accessory. Place yourself in Kemelman’s position
immediately after Welt has left the ofﬁce. The time for playing Watson to Welt’s
Holmes is over; you are a prosecutor who must now seek evidence sufﬁcient to prove
that: It was A (or B) who murdered C.
a The elements of the crime deﬁne the conditions that the ultimate proposition to be
proved (the ultimate probandum) must satisfy. Connecticut statutes currently
provide:
A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another
person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a
suicide by force, duress or deception . . . (Conn. Gen. Stat. §53a–54a)
A person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense,
who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another

Analysis of Evidence
person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally
liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the
principal offender. (Conn. Gen. Stat. §53a–8)
What precisely must Kemelman seek to prove? Frame the ultimate proposition to
be proved for the murderer and for the accessory. The standard of proof at trial will
be “beyond reasonable doubt”; what standard should guide (a) the decision to
arrest, (b) the decision to charge with murder? Are these standards met in the story?
3. Generalizations, stories, and arguments2
a. Brides in the bath: closing speech3
George Joseph Smith, who was married, had gone through a ceremony of marriage
withthreewomeninclosesuccession–BessieMundy,AliceBurnham,andMargaret
Lofty. He induced each of them to execute a will naming him as her beneﬁciary. Each
of them drowned in a bathtub shortly thereafter. He was indicted and tried for the
murder of Ms. Mundy. The prosecution was permitted to introduce evidence about
the “marriages,” wills, and circumstances of the death of the other two women. The
following is an excerpt from the closing speech for the Crown.
The prisoner and the woman being alone in the house, he had the opportunity of com-
mitting the crime. The motive of the prisoner has been demonstrated, the opportunity
admitted, and the exclusion of accident proved. You are entitled to look at the evidence
as to the two other deaths to see whether the death of Miss Mundy was accident or
designed, and, if designed, for the beneﬁt of whom? You can also look at that evidence
to see whether the death was part of a system or course of conduct – horrible as it is to
think so – of deliberately causing people’s deaths in order that monetary beneﬁt might
ensue to him.
The three cases are of such a character that such a large aggregation of resemblances
cannot have occurred without design. In each case the prisoner went through the form
of marriage; in each case the ready money of the woman was either realized or drawn
out of whatever deposit bank it might have been in; in each case there was a will drawn
in favour of the prisoner absolutely; in each case the will was drawn by a stranger to the
testatrix; in each case the victim insured her life or was possessed of property which did
not make it necessary to insure her life; in each case there was a visit to a doctor shortly
before the death, which, we contend, was unnecessary from the physical condition of
the patient; in each case the women wrote letters to relatives the night before, or on the
night on which they died; in each case there was an inquiry as to a bathroom (or the
provision of a bath); in each case the woman died from drowning, and the prisoner
was the ﬁrst to discover it; in each case the bathroom doors were unfastened and the
water was not drawn off until after the doctor had been; and in each case the prisoner
was putting demonstrably forward the purchase of either ﬁsh, or eggs, or tomatoes to
show that he was absent from the house in which his wife was lying dead; and in each

case there was the prisoner’s subsequent disappearance and the monetary advantage
resulting or attempted to be made to result.
Questions
This is the peroration of the famous closing speech by Archibald Bodkin QC in R.
v. George Joseph Smith.
1 Is this a story or an argument or both?
2 To what extent does the persuasiveness of the passage depend on (i) logic (ii) rhetoric?
3 Can you summarize the argument in a single sentence?
b. Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681 (1988)
A federal grand jury indicted Gary Rufus Huddleston, charging that, in April 1985,
he had sold (count one) and had possessed (count two) Memorex videocassette
tapes (the “tapes”) that had been stolen in interstate commerce. The tapes had been
stolen, and Huddleston had sold and had possessed quantities of the tapes. The
only issue in dispute was whether Huddleston knew that the tapes had been stolen
at the time he had sold or possessed them. The issue was apparently a close one:
After two days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Huddleston on the charge that
he had knowingly sold stolen tapes, but convicted him on the charge that he had
knowingly possessed stolen tapes.
According to Huddleston, Leroy Wesby had a large quantity of the tapes, had
invitedHuddlestontosellthemonacommissionbasis,andhadassuredHuddleston
that the tapes were legitimate. Huddleston offered and sold quantities of the tapes
at prices that were below the cost of manufacturing the tapes. Huddleston acknowl-
edged that he had possessed and sold substantial quantities of the tapes, but claimed
that he had no knowledge that they were stolen.
The government introduced evidence that, in February 1985, Huddleston had
arranged a sale of 38 new 12′′ black and white television sets (the “TV sets”), also
supplied by Wesby, to Paul Toney, a retailer, for $28 per set. Huddleston did not
produce a bill of sale at trial and, according to Toney, he got the impression that
Huddleston could obtain a lot more of these sets.
The government also offered evidence that in May 1985, Huddleston had offered
to sell to an FBI undercover agent a large quantity of Amana appliances that also had
been supplied by Wesby. It was undisputed that these appliances had been stolen.
Huddleston testiﬁed that he had asked and Wesby had assured him that the TV sets
and the appliances were legitimate.
Questions
1 In its opinion, the Supreme Court said:
In assessing whether the evidence was sufﬁcient to support a ﬁnding that the
televisions were stolen, the court here was required to consider not only the direct

Analysis of Evidence
evidence on that point – the low price of the televisions, the large quantity offered
for sale, and petitioner’s inability to produce a bill of sale – but also the evidence
concerning petitioner’s involvement in the sales of other stolen merchandise obtained
from Wesby, such as the Memorex tapes and the Amana appliances. Given this
evidence, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the televisions were
stolen, and the trial court therefore properly allowed the evidence to go to the
jury. (Id. at 691 (emphasis added))
a The Joint Appendix ﬁled with the Court contained no evidence concerning the
wholesale price of 12′′ black and white TV sets. How did the Court conclude that
$28 was a price so low as to excite suspicion that the sets were stolen?
b Did the fact that the Memorex tapes Huddleston sold in April and the fact that the
Amana appliances he offered for sale in May were stolen support an inference that
the TV sets he stole in February were also stolen goods? If so, explain how.
c For every step in an inferential argument, there must be a generalization that
makes the step logical. What generalizations would justify the italicized portion of
the Court’s statement?
2 The government based its theory of relevance upon a generalization, which, according
to the Supreme Court, was:
. . . the televisions were stolen, and proof that petitioner [Huddleston] had engaged
in a series of sales of stolen merchandise from the same suspicious source would be
strong evidence that he was aware that each of these items, including the Memorex
tapes, was stolen. (Id. at 686)
a Do you ﬁnd the generalization urged by the government persuasive? Are there any
ﬂaws that should be corrected?
b How does the fact that the Amana appliances Huddleston offered for sale in May
were stolen support an inference that Huddleston knew in April that the Memorex
tapes were stolen?
c Assuming that the sale of stolen tapes in April and the stolen appliances in May
support an inference that the TV sets sold in February were stolen, did that fact
support further inference that Huddleston knew that the Memorex tapes were
stolen in February?
d How would you argue that the improper prejudicial effects of introducing
evidence about (i) Huddleston’s sale of the TV sets and (ii) his offer to sell the
Amana appliances substantially outweighed any legitimate probative value that
evidence might have with respect to Huddleston’s knowledge that the
Memorex tapes were stolen? Examine each transaction separately and then in
combination. Identify each improper prejudicial effect and then construct your
argument.
c. Miller v. Jackson (Lord Denning MR) [1977] 3 All E. R. 340, 340–41 (CA)
In a summer time village cricket is the delight of everyone. Nearly every village has its
own cricket ﬁeld where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of
Lintz in County Durham they have their own ground, where they have played these

last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outﬁeld
is kept short. It has a good club-house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The
village team plays there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, competing
with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practice while the
light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they
must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done
it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built,
or has had built for him, a house on the edge of the cricket ground which four years
ago was a ﬁeld where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this
adjoining ﬁeld has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the
houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point.
Now he complains that, when a batsman hits a six, the ball has been known to land in
his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go
out at weekends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say
that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the
judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped; with
the consequences, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket
ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The
young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much
the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next
to the cricket ground.
Questions
1 Is this a story?
2 Some people ﬁnd this persuasive, but others consider it “unjudge-like.” What reasons
might be given in support of each view?
3 Can you show that in this passage, read on its own, Lord Denning (i) contradicted
himself; (ii) invented some facts; (iii) introduced facts that are not relevant to a claim
in nuisance?
4. Evidence from two causes c´el`ebres
a. Commonwealth v. Sacco and Vanzetti (Mass. 1921)
Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti emigrated from Italy to America in the
early 1900s. They were regularly employed and were respected and well liked by
everyone who had contact with them. In 1920 Sacco was employed as a shoe-
edger and Vanzetti as a ﬁsh-peddler. But they were also implacable anarchists.
Following World War I, there were many instances of what we would today call
acts of terrorism. Members of anarchistic groups were associated with these acts of
terrorism, and Sacco and Vanzetti were members of one of these groups. In 1920
they were charged with felony murder in a commonplace but ruthless crime. They
were tried, convicted, and executed in 1927. Their trial is arguably the ranking cause
c´el`ebre in American legal history. Their case has been referred to as “the case that
will not die.” Arguments exist to this day about whether Sacco and Vanzetti were

Analysis of Evidence
convicted for being murderers or for being anarchists. One major element of the
argument that they were wrongly convicted concerns the authenticity of certain
ﬁrearms evidence against Sacco.
On Thursday, April 15, 1920, two payroll guards, Alessandro Berardelli and
Frederick Parmenter, were carrying two metal boxes containing $15,773.15 in bills
and coin, which represented the week’s payroll for employees of the Slater-Morrill
ShoeCompanyinSouthBraintree,Massachusetts.AstheyheadeddownPearlStreet
in the direction of this shoe company, Berardelli and Parmenter were attacked by
two men whom witnesses said were loitering in the vicinity of the crime scene.
Berardelli was shot four times and died instantly. Parmenter was shot twice and
died the next day; he was not able to identify his assailants.
On May 5, 1920, Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested for reasons having nothing
to do with this crime. Police ofﬁcers Michael Connolly and Frank Vaughn arrested
them. They had been told that they were suspicious persons and that they had stolen
a car. At the time of their arrest, Sacco was carrying a 32-caliber Colt automatic
pistol. On September 11, they were indicted and charged with ﬁrst degree felony
murder for the slaying of Berardelli and Parmenter.
At their trial, Ofﬁcer Connolly testiﬁed: “Sacco attempted on several occasions
to put his hand under his overcoat in spite of being warned [by Connolly] not
to do so.” Later in the trial, a forensic surgeon, Dr. Magrath, testiﬁed that he had
extracted four 32-caliber bullets from the body of Berardelli and marked each one
on its base with Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV. Magrath testiﬁed that Bullet III,
admitted at trial as Exhibit 18, was the bullet that killed Berardelli. During the trial,
the prosecution went to considerable lengths to show that Exhibit 18 had been ﬁred
through the 32-caliber Colt automatic that was alleged to belong to Sacco. The
court allowed both the prosecution and defense to test-ﬁre bullets through Sacco’s
32-caliber Colt automatic to see if the markings on the test bullets matched those of
Exhibit 18 shown at trial. Prosecution and defense ballistics experts disagreed about
whether Exhibit 18 had been ﬁred through Sacco’s 32-caliber Colt automatic.
All witnesses to the shooting testiﬁed that one gunman ﬁred four shots in succes-
sion into Berardelli’s body. When the four bullets are examined together, however,
it is obvious that the riﬂing pattern on Exhibit 18 does not match the patterns on
Bullets I, II, and IV. Exhibit 18 cannot have been ﬁred from the same weapon as the
other three bullets. (The prosecution never showed the four bullets all together at
trial and were never requested to do so by the defense.)
Questions
1 Did Connolly’s testimony that: “Sacco attempted on several occasions to put his hand
under his overcoat in spite of being warned [by Connolly] not to do so” make it any
more probable that it was Sacco who shot Berardelli? Identify each inference that must
be accepted in order to demonstrate that Connolly’s testimony was relevant to the
proposition it was Sacco who shot Berardelli.

2 What is the signiﬁcance of the fact that the riﬂing pattern on Exhibit 18 does not
match the patterns on Bullets I, II, and IV and the resulting inference that Exhibit 18
cannot have been ﬁred from the same weapon as the other three bullets? What are the
possible explanations for this discrepancy? Had the comparison been made at trial,
how would you have explained the discrepancy if you were the prosecutor? If you were
counsel for Sacco, what additional inferences would you argue that the jury should
make based upon the comparison of the four bullets?
b. People v. Simpson (Cal. 1994)
In July, 1994, the state of California formally charged that Orenthal James Simpson
(OJS)hadmurderedhisformerwife,NicoleBrownSimpson(NBS),andabystander,
Ronald L. Goldman (RLG), on June 12, 1994. The trial took place in 1995. One of
the issues was whether OJS could have had an opportunity to commit the crimes.
The only evidence presented at trial bearing upon that issue is summarized below.
Sometime between 10:15 and 10:20 p.m., on June 12, 1994, Pablo Fuentes heard
the “plaintive wail” of a dog. Around 10:45 p.m., Steven Schwab found NBS’s Akita
with blood on its paws. At about the same time, Kato Kaelin, a guest in OJS’s house,
heard three thumps on the wall outside his bedroom that he thought might be an
earthquake. He went out and walked along a path behind the house, but he did
not see anything. Alan Park was a limousine driver scheduled to drive OJS to the
Los Angeles Airport to catch an 11:45 p.m. ﬂight to Chicago. He arrived at OJS’s
house early. He pressed the buzzer at the gate at 10:40 and again at 10:49 and got no
answer. At 10:55, Park saw an African-American male dressed in dark clothes enter
the house. At 10:56, he buzzed again and OJS answered. OJS said he had been in the
shower and would be out in a few minutes. Kaelin opened the gate and Park drove
the limo to the front door. There were two black duffel bags on the doorstep. At
11:00, OJS came out. He was wearing stone-washed blue jeans and a white polo shirt
and was carrying a coat over his arm and a designer hanging bag. Park shook hands
with him. He did not notice any cuts or blood on his hand or anything else unusual.
According to Detective Vannatter, it took about ﬁve minutes to drive, observing the
speed limit, from NBS’s house at 875 Bundy Drive to OJS’s house at 360 North
Rockingham Avenue.
Problems
1 Construct a story that accounts for each event and observation reported above and
that shows that OJS almost certainly could have murdered NBS and RLG.
2 Construct a story that accounts for each event and observation reported above and
that shows that OJS almost certainly could not have murdered NBS and RLG.

Analysis of Evidence
The Case File
In January, the United States Attorney for the Middle District of New State ﬁled an
indictment alleging that Richard Able had knowingly ﬁled a false federal income tax
return for the year 2003 with intent to defraud the federal government of income tax
due and owing. The indictment alleged that during 2003 Able had received income
in an amount no less than $45,000 that had not been included on his income tax
return for that year. The indictment is otherwise sufﬁcient, and the court has denied
the defendant’s motion to dismiss.
Pursuant to the court’s standing discovery order, the government has ﬁled a
list of prospective witnesses and copies of documents it may seek to introduce in
evidence. The list of prospective witnesses include: (i) Samuel Baker, managing
partner in a New York law ﬁrm (the “Law Firm”); (ii) Timothy Cooper, a certiﬁed
public accountant in New City; (iii) Carol Able, Able’s ex-wife; (iv) Linda Davis,
a model and Able’s ex-girlfriend; and (v) various bank ofﬁcers, Internal Revenue
Service ofﬁcials, and others who can lay a proper foundation for certain of the
documents listed. The documents produced include: (i) a cancelled check in the
amount of $25,000 dated December 15, 2003, issued by the Law Firm payable to
Able with endorsements showing that Able cashed it on December 20, 2003, at the
Citibank branch in Las Vegas; (ii) a 2003 federal income tax return signed by Able
and by Cooper as the preparer dated April 15, 2004, that reports Able’s gross income
from all sources for the year 2003 as $125,000; (iii)–(v) Able’s federal income tax
returns for prior years prepared by a New York accountant reporting gross income
for 2000 as $375,000; for 2001 as $410,000; and for 2002 as $275,000; (vi)–(vii)
cancelled checks from two law ﬁrms in New City showing payments to Able during
2003 aggregating $20,000 as consulting fees and bearing endorsements showing
that they were deposited in Able’s bank account during that year; (viii) a certiﬁed
copy of a divorce decree entered by the Supreme Court of New York indicating that
in 2000 Able agreed and the court ordered him to transfer assets with an aggregate
value of $750,000 to his wife Carol in full settlement of all claims she might have
arising from the marriage, for alimony or otherwise, and to pay the sum of $35,000
per year for the support of his two young children who remained in the custody of
Carol; (ix) a xerox copy of a love letter from Linda Davis to Able dated December
1, 2003, that includes the statement, “Remember, darling, what we talked about in
the disco – no risks, no me”; and (x) micro-ﬁlm copies of Able’s bank statements
and cancelled checks for the years 1999 through 2003.
In response to Able’s demand for discovery pursuant to constitutional and statu-
tory requirements, the government has also produced a copy of reports submitted
by FBI or IRS agents summarizing interviews with various witnesses. These include
a three-page memorandum by FBI Agent Dawes stating that he had interviewed
Timothy Cooper in August 2004 and that, among other things, Cooper had told him
that Cooper had merged his accounting practice in July 2004 and that his secretary
had lost or thrown out some materials, such as notes and work papers, contained in
inactive client-ﬁles. According to the memorandum, Cooper told Dawes that Able

25
was listed as an inactive client at the time because he had not consulted Cooper or
returned Cooper’s calls concerning preparation of Able’s 2004 income tax return.
Dawes’s memorandum reported that Cooper could not tell from examining the ﬁle
whether any materials from Able’s ﬁle had been discarded, but said he thought it
unlikely. Dawes’s memorandum reported that Cooper had no recollection of how
the signing of Able’s return was handled, but Cooper said that he usually mailed two
copies of a return to his clients with an envelope adressed to the Internal Revenue
Service and a note instructing them to review, sign, and mail the completed returns
by April 15. The memorandum reports that Cooper could not ﬁnd a copy of such
a note with the copy of Able’s 2003 return in his ﬁles. Cooper reported that the
ﬁle contains no information about any income other than Able’s salary, and that
Cooper did not recall Able informing him that he had received any other income.
Pursuant to the court’s reciprocal discovery requirement, Able has listed the
followingpossiblewitnesses:(i)JoanEvans,Able’spresentgirlfriend;(ii)KarlFrank,
dean of the New State University Law School; and (iii) various New State law
professorsandNewYorklawyerswhohaveworkedwithAbleduringhisprofessional
career, as possible character witnesses. Able has also produced for the government
a xerox copy of a handwritten note reading:
April 11, 2004
Dear Tim:
When we met last month, I gave you the information about my regular and
summer school salary from the law school and my expenses last year. As promised,
I have reviewed my bank records and notes and have determined that I received
$25,000 from my former New York law ﬁrm as my share of a contingent fee they
received on a case on which I had worked, and $20,000 for miscellaneous consulting
work I did for ﬁrms here in New City. Because I will be out of town on the 15th, I
have signed and enclosed a blank, undated 1040 form. I also enclose a signed check

These include a memorandum based upon notes from interviews with Able. The
principal points in that memorandum are as follows:
i Able spent 12 years with the Law Firm, seven as an associate, and ﬁve as a partner.
The tax returns for 1999, 2000, and 2001 were prepared by a New York accounting
ﬁrm that did the returns for all the Law Firm’s partners. They are accurate insofar as
Able knows.
ii Able left the ﬁrm in mid-2002 and joined the law faculty at New State University
where he is presently employed. In 2003, his salary for the academic year was
$105,000, and he was paid $20,000 for teaching in the summer quarter.
iii Able says he earned $20,000 for miscellaneous consulting work for New City ﬁrms.
The $25,000 check represented his share of a court-awarded fee in a case on which he
had worked while at the Law Firm.

Analysis of Evidence
iv Able says he retained Cooper in March 2004. He wrote the April letter just before he
left for a one-week trip to attend a conference in Chicago. According to Able he gave
the letter to his girlfriend, Joan Evans, and asked her to deliver it to Cooper after she
dropped him at the airport. Able said that he did not like Cooper, and he has since
done his own returns because they are rather simple.
v Able said that Baker disliked him because Able was one of the “young turk” partners
who had led the Law Firm into plaintiff’s litigation in which fees were contingent
upon results. The practice was eventually successful, but Baker was an old-timer who
thought that kind of practice was inconsistent with the Law Firm’s reputation as an
old-line corporate and banking ﬁrm.
vi Able acknowledged that he and his ex-wife Carol had been social cocaine users, and
he suspects Baker may try to suggest that Able was asked to leave the Law Firm for
this reason.
vii Able reported that as part of the settlement with Carol, she had waived any claim to
his retirement account containing $600,000 and that, after transfering assets valued
at $750,000 and paying his attorney’s fees and costs, he had about $150,000 in cash,
which he used to make a $100,000 down payment on a house he bought for $400,000
and to pay for moving expenses, for repairs and minor improvements to the house,
and for furniture and other furnishings for the house. Able acknowledged that he
made himself a promise when he entered practice that he would keep his pensions
intact until he retired.
viii Able admitted that he went to Las Vegas with his ex-girlfriend, Linda Davis, in
December 2003 in an effort to please her. He cashed the Law Firm check at a branch
of his bank as convenience to be sure he had the cash before Christmas. Able said
that he returned with more than $15,000 cash, he lent $6,000 to Linda as the down
payment for a small Porsche, spent the $2,500 on Christmas gifts for Linda and his
two children, and he used the balance for miscellaneous expenses in January and
February.
ix Able said that shortly after their return from Las Vegas, he learned that Linda had a
reputation as a heavy coke user and as a New City “call girl.” He said they broke up
when he asked her to sign a note for the $6,000 loan. According to Able, the breakup
was bitter and Linda has since refused to discuss the loan. Able said he thinks Linda
would say the $6,000 was a gift or would claim that he “blew” most of the $25,000 at
the tables in Las Vegas.
x According to Able, he has not used cocaine even socially since he began dating Joan
Evans because of her strong religious views. She works as a librarian and is still his
girlfriend.
The ﬁle also contains memoranda and notes from telephone and personal inter-
views indicating that:
i Joan Evans conﬁrms that she delivered the April 11 letter to Cooper’s ofﬁce and
handed it to his secretary who identiﬁed herself as Mrs. Cooper. She says that Able
is a brilliant lawyer and a good man and that he has never used cocaine in her
presence;

ii Baker hung up the telephone after commenting that Able’s taste for cocaine and fast
women had ﬁnally brought him his just reward;
iii Carol Able said she bore her ex-husband no ill will and would be happy to testify if it
would help; and
iv Cooper and Davis refused to discuss the matter.
Questions
1. Provisional theories of the case
a
What do you anticipate will be the government’s theory of the case in light of the
available evidence and your analysis? What will be its principal themes? Its story?
b
In light of that analysis and an analysis of the evidence available to you, what will be
the defendant’s theory of the case? The principal themes? The story?
2. Admissibility of the evidence
a
Trial preparation. The government has identiﬁed four substantive witnesses and nine
substantive documents through which it intends to prove its case.
i The government’s documents. In light of the provisional theories, to what fact of
consequence in the litigation will the government claim each document is
relevant? Which documents will you seek to exclude and on what basis? How
should counsel for the government respond, and what is the probable result?
ii The government’s witnesses. Are you likely to be able to exclude any testimony
concerning Able’s use of cocaine? What will the government argue and how will
you respond? How should the court rule? Are there other signiﬁcant lines of
testimony that the government is likely to seek to elicit that you would expect to
be able to exclude? If so, which, and on what bases?
b
The trial. The government has presented its case and rested. The court has denied
your motion for a directed verdict.
i On cross-examination, Cooper testiﬁed that he did not recall seeing Able’s
April 11th letter; that had his ofﬁce received it, it would have been in the client-ﬁle
he maintained for Able, and it is not; that his ﬁles were perfectly maintained; that
he does not recall discussing any papers being lost in his 2004 move; and that he
has never seen Agent Dawes’s memorandum and it does not refresh his
recollection. How will you proceed to impeach his credibility in your case in chief?
How will you respond to the government’s hearsay objections? Are you likely to
succeed?
ii Able has identiﬁed the April 11th letter and testiﬁed that he wrote and gave it to
Joan Evans to deliver it to Cooper. The government has objected to the admission
of the letter on the grounds that (1) its relevance has not been established; (2) it is
not the best evidence; and (3) it is inadmissible hearsay. How do you respond?
iii Apart from Able’s testimony concerning his conversations with Cooper and the
April 11th letter and Evans’s testimony concerning the delivery to Cooper’s ofﬁce,
what additional testimony will you seek to introduce through these or other
witnesses? Why? Does your answer depend upon whether you won or lost
objections you made during the government’s case? Explain.

Analysis of Evidence
3. The Nature of Proof
Would the application of the rules of evidence result in the exclusion of logically
relevant evidence? Would the exclusion of such evidence enhance the likelihood
that the jury would make a true determination? A just determination? Should the
case of United States v. Able be submitted to the jury? What does it mean to say
that a jury might ﬁnd that the evidence established Able’s guilt beyond and to the
exclusion of every reasonable doubt?
6. Sargent v. Southern Accident Co.4
You are a lawyer in private practice. Southern Accident Company has retained you
to defend it in an action by plaintiff Porter E. Sargent, beneﬁciary of a life insurance
policy issued by the company and covering his son Upham Sargent. The plaintiff
claims $500,000, the amount payable if the insured suffers an “accidental injury that
is the sole cause of death resulting within 90 days after the accidental injury.” The
policy excludes suicide, but not recklessness or engaging in hazardous activities. The
defendant company does not contend that the plaintiff’s proof of loss was not timely
or that the plaintiff failed to inform it in writing of all facts known or discovered
by plaintiff. However, the policy requires “written proof covering the occurrence,
character, and extent of the loss for which claim is made,” and the company takes
the position that the facts submitted to it fail to show that Upham Sargent died by
“accidental injury” within the provisions of the policy.
Pre-trial discovery proceedings have been completed and the company’s claims
supervisor is considering making a ﬁnal offer of settlement to plaintiff before trial.
In order to make that decision he has asked your opinion whether the plaintiff’s
evidence is sufﬁcient for the plaintiff to avoid a directed verdict in the defendant’s
favor, that is, whether there is sufﬁcient evidence from which a reasonable jury could
conclude that Upham Sargent suffered an “accidental injury that was the sole cause
of death resulting within 90 days after the accidental injury.”
Your answer will depend on your analysis of the evidence the plaintiff is likely
to offer at the trial. The plaintiff’s probable evidence, consisting of the testimony
of ﬁve witnesses, is set forth on the following pages. Assume that all ﬁve witnesses
will testify at the trial and that all will be credible. Assume the following standard
for decision: Could a jury of reasonable persons ﬁnd that the evidence presented
satisﬁed the test on a “balance of probabilities”?
Plaintiff’s Evidence
Testimony of Porter E. Sargent. The insured was my son, Upham Sargent. When
he died he was 21 years old. He was ﬁnancially comfortable, mentally well bal-
anced, vigorous, athletic, resourceful, courageous, a good swimmer, and of some
experience in living in wild country without provisions. For several years he had
taken hazardous and adventurous journeys alone in this country and in Europe.

Evidence and inference: some food for thought
29
Upham had ﬁnished his junior year in college in the spring of 2002. He lived with
my wife and myself in our home in Boston until August, 2002, when he left to go
on a kayak trip in northern Quebec. Before leaving he outlined to me the trip from
Boston via Montreal to Senneterre. From Senneterre he planned to travel by kayak
to Mattagami Lake at the head of the Nottaway River. His intention was to run down
the river in his kayak in a northwesterly direction, into James Bay, and to go to a
trading post of the Hudson’s Bay Company on James Bay, called Rupert’s House.
He left Boston on a train for Montreal on August 1, 2002. He traveled with a green
kayak. The boat was eighteen feet long and not as deep as a canoe. He transported
the kayak in the baggage car of the train. The kayak had the name “Sargent” burned
into the wood inside its stern. When he left Boston he also had with him a small
repeating riﬂe with ammunition, a sleeping robe, matches, $800 in money, snares
and ﬁshing tackle, and a good supply of food. He had no clothes for winter weather.
His mother and I said goodbye to him at North Station in Boston on August 1,
2002. We never saw him again.
Testimony of George Birdsong. I live on an Indian reservation at the northern reaches
of the Nottaway River, near its mouth. We are friendly and hospitable Indians, who
live by trapping and selling the skins at Rupert’s House. The Indians who live at
Mattagami Lake are equally friendly and hospitable. They trade at Senneterre, to the
south. The Nottaway River varies from a ﬁfth to a half-mile in width and consists
of a series of dangerous rapids among large boulders. The river falls about seven
hundred feet in its course. The only possible channel through rapids is usually near
one bank or the other. In that river if one should not ﬁnd the channel he could not
cross to the other side. An upset in the river would probably mean death. Even the
best canoeists would ﬁnd that river very hazardous. Only three parties are known
to have descended it safely. The customary route from Mattagami Lake to Rupert’s
House is much longer and avoids the Nottaway River. There are no portages, roads,
trails, or paths in the country drained by the river. That country is ﬂat, desolate,
and unforested, with many swamps and with no elevations of consequence. Fish
and blueberries are plentiful, and there are some ducks and rabbits.
IwasvisitingfriendsandworkingonthereservationatMattagamiLakeinAugust
and September, 2002. I met Upham Sargent when he came there about September
1, 2002. He told me he was going down the Nottaway River in his kayak. I had never
heard of anyone trying to go down the Nottaway River in a kayak. I warned him
that the trip would be very dangerous. Sargent stayed in the Mattagami reservation
until September 8. That day I saw him load his supplies and belongings into the
kayak, get into the kayak and set off down the river. I never saw him again.
In October, 2002, I found his paddle on the bank of the Nottaway River, on the
fringe of a whirlpool 50 or 60 miles from the mouth of the river.
Testimony of Henry Largetree. I live near the Nottaway River. I never met Upham
Sargent. In May 2003 I found the bow section of a green kayak under some rocks
in the Nottaway River. The place was about 40 miles from the river’s mouth.

Analysis of Evidence
Testimony of Clarence Rockbound. I am a senior geologist in the service of the Cana-
dian Government. Among my duties are preparing topographical surveys of various
localities in Canada. I have surveyed the area of the Nottaway River. The length of
the river from the head of the Nottaway River in Lake Mattagami to its mouth is
225 kilometers (140 miles). I prepared the “Nottaway Sheet” of the geological sur-
vey of Canada. I have never travelled through the rapids of the Nottaway River, but
from my studies and work in the region I have acquired a general knowledge of the
character of the river and the region through which it ﬂows. I have descended the
rapids of another river a little north of the Nottaway in a canoe. It is my opinion
that an individual in a kayak loaded with supplies could not descend the Nottaway
River without being drowned. In my opinion based upon my experience, a kayak
managed by one person and carrying a load cannot stay aﬂoat in the quick water
of great power that ﬂows among the boulders of the Nottaway River. I also have
an opinion that it would be possible that in an upset the person would lose his
kayak and all his equipment and, though he might reach the shore safely, he would
eventually starve to death. At the same time I believe from my knowledge of the
Nottaway River area that there were plenty of blueberries there in September and
October, 2002, on which one could live for a month.
Testimony of Sergeant Horatio Renfrew. I am a sergeant in the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police. I was in charge of coordinating the search efforts for Upham
Sargent. Search parties were organized by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the
Hudson’s Bay Company, Revillon Freres Ltd., the Indians of the Nottaway River
neighborhood, and other persons in the north country. The searches were made
during the period from September 20, 2002 to February 28, 2003. I personally made
an airplane ﬂight in February 2003 over the northern reaches of the Nottaway River
in the hope of sighting Upham Sargent or his body. I have never found him or his
body. All of the other search parties reported to me that they had not found Sargent
or his body. On March 1, 2003, I instructed them to discontinue the search.
Questions
1 What is the ultimate proposition of fact, the ultimate probandum, that the plaintiff
must prove in order to prevail? State the proposition. How many conditions must be
satisﬁed? State each condition as a simple proposition.
2 Analyze all of the plaintiff’s evidence to determine whether it is sufﬁcient to avoid a
directed verdict in the defendant’s favor. Prepare a concise outline identifying as a
separate proposition each relevant fact that can be shown by the testimony. State as
separate propositions the relevant inferences that can be drawn from these evidential
propositions. Complete the analysis by organizing the data in a manner that compels
the conclusion that the plaintiff does or does not have sufﬁcient evidence to satisfy all
of the conditions required by the ultimate proposition that he must prove, that is, to
prove each of the material facts in issue.
