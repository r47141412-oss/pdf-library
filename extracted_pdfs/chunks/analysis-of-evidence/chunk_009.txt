Analysis of Evidence
In response to the housekeeper’s call, I was dispatched to Vern’s home at 8:15, Monday
morning. The housekeeper said she had arrived at 8:00 a.m. and discovered Vern’s
body lying on the living room ﬂoor. The living room was a shambles. Upon examining
the body, I found a scrap of brown Harris tweed cloth clutched in Vern’s right hand.
(I extracted the scrap of cloth, placed it in an evidence bag, marked and sealed the bag,
and subsequently delivered it to the police evidence custodian.)
. . . After learning that Vern had been wealthy and that his sole surviving heir was
a nephew named Archer, I proceeded to Archer’s house to interview him. I arrived at
5:30 p.m., Wednesday. Archer stated he had been at home and had gone to bed early
on Sunday and had gone directly to work Monday morning.
. . . As I was departing, I observed a brown Harris tweed jacket in Archer’s front
closet. It had a hole in the upper right hand sleeve.
. . . At 7:30 a.m., Thursday, I returned with a warrant to search Archer’s home.
I seized the jacket, placed it in an evidence bag, and sealed and marked the bag. A visual
comparison of the scrap of cloth found in Vern’s hand and the jacket shows that the
scrap and the jacket are the same color, texture, and weave. The scrap ﬁts in the hole in
the upper right sleeve of the jacket . . .
On the strength of this and other evidence, Archer has been arrested and indicted
for the murder of Vern. You are now preparing for trial and planning what further
investigations should be done. Your current provisional ultimate probandum is:
“It was Archer who murdered Vern.” For today, you are only concerned with the
relationship between the propositions supported by the scrap of cloth, the jacket,
and Paul’s anticipated testimony with respect to these two items.
1 Create and number a keylist of simple propositions which you could elicit as
testimonial assertions from Detective Paul and the circumstantial propositions you
would argue that the trier of fact should infer directly from these testimonial
assertions and the scrap of cloth and the jacket and label. Each proposition should be
phrased as a simple declarative statement to which the trier of fact might assign a
truth value (for instance, true or false, probable or not probable). Each proposition
representing a testimonial assertion or a physical object must be an autoptic
proference the jury will hear or see.
2 Given the ultimate probandum, “It was Archer who murdered Vern,” identify each
intermediate proposition the trier of fact must infer in order to conclude that the
evidential propositions you have listed support the conclusion that the ultimate
probandum is true.
3 Abduction: We are concerned here only with the scrap of cloth, the jacket, and the
circumstances in which each was discovered. In light of these facts and the analysis
you have developed, what additional evidential data might be available to strengthen
or weaken the inference that P is true? State precisely the plausible hypotheses that
should be investigated and speciﬁc evidence you would direct Paul to seek to support
(or eliminate) each.
4 Defense Counsel’s Preliminary Standpoint. You have been appointed to represent
Archer. You have not met him. The prosecution has given you Paul’s reports. You

have, of course, performed the same analysis as the prosecutor in order to evaluate the
case and to determine what information you will seek from Archer and what other
investigations you will make. Formulate a list of propositions that might explain away
the prosecutor’s proposed inferences. Do the facts as reported by Paul suggest any
possible propositions for which there might be evidential support and which would
involve the rival or denial processes? List the potential propositions. Classify each
proposition on your list as opponent’s explanation (OE), denial (OD), or rival (OR).

Methods of analysis
A. Introduction
The principles of inductive logic are the common tools of practical reasoning and
are important to anyone who must make decisions based upon incomplete and
fallible data. These tools are specially important in many professions. Society holds
professionals to a higher standard of reasoning because, ordinarily, their decisions
can signiﬁcantly affect the interests of individuals or society as a whole, and they
are supposed to be competent to make such decisions. In one view, the highest
standards may reasonably be required of doctors and lawyers. They undertake to
solve problems of great importance for individuals, and their work in the aggregate
is critical to society.
Every profession that engages in fact analysis and reasoning must develop
ways of recording and organizing the data in forms suitable for analysis and use.
This is surely true for lawyers. At every stage, the lawyer must engage in analysis.
Has my client provided me with sufﬁcient facts to state a claim for relief or a basis
for a defense? What additional evidence should I seek to test and strengthen my
client’s case? Given the evidence available to both sides, can the data be marshaled
to persuade the relevant decision-maker that my client is entitled to satisfactory
relief?
Analysis must ordinarily precede use, and a system designed to record and orga-
nize data in a manner that facilitates analysis will ordinarily differ signiﬁcantly from
a system designed to facilitate the effective, post-analysis use of that data. The lawyer
then needs a system under which the data can be organized and marshaled for pre-
sentation in the appropriate context, be it counseling, negotiation, or trial. Here,
the nature of the forum in which the evidence and arguments will be presented
dictates the requirements for a system to order and organize the available data for
its intended use.
Lawyers have developed a variety of systems for recording and organizing data.
The ﬁling system in a lawyer’s ofﬁce is designed to ensure information received on
each matter and the products of any analysis or research are organized to facilitate
retrieval for use. Chronologies have long been recognized as a useful device for
organizing factual information for analysis. Over the past two decades, lawyers

(and other professionals) have developed sophisticated record management and
indexing systems to facilitate analysis, often augmented by computerized support
systems.1 So too, they have developed devices such as the trial book to organize the
data for effective presentation to a tribunal in light of the analysis done. There has,
however, been far less attention devoted to articulating the principles and protocols
that should be applied in analyzing factual data in legal (and other) contexts in
order to enhance the quality and the completeness of the analysis.
In this chapter, we present a generalized set of procedures, a protocol, that we
think may usefully be applied in any method of analysis. In Chapter 5, we present
a simpliﬁed version of Wigmore’s chart method of analysis and show how the
protocol can be adapted and applied to use that method. In Chapter 6, we describe
the outline method of analysis and the uses of narrative and chronologies as analytic
devices. In that chapter, we also describe how and when the different methods and
devices can be used in the context of a case to be litigated and tried.
B. The methods and a protocol for their use
1. Methods of analysis and analytic devices
In this book we present two methods of analysis – the “chart method” and the
“outline method.” A “method of analysis” in this context is a method for record-
ing and organizing data and for specifying the logical relationships among the
propositions and how they can be marshaled to support or negate a fact of conse-
quence. Each method of analysis results in a distinct product. The distinctive feature
of the chart method is that the principal products are a key-list and a chart. The
“key-list” contains all of the evidential and inferential propositions that can be mar-
shaled to support or undermine the ultimate proposition to be proved, the ultimate
probandum. The “chart” uses symbols to depict the claimed logical relationships
between these propositions. (See page 139 below for an illustration.) The product
of the outline method of analysis is an outline that simpliﬁes the complex propo-
sition that is the ultimate probandum into simple propositions, the penultimate
probanda, and uses them as the major headings in the outline. The major headings
are then divided and subdivided into necessary intermediate propositions until the
analyst reaches the evidential propositions – the propositions that express what the
decision-maker will hear or see, if and when the case is tried.

2 Wigmore thought that narratives constituted a separate “method of analysis” (Science, 821). For
reasons described below, we maintain that narrative complements analysis but is not an alternative
to analysis. Although narrative serves many purposes, we characterize it here as an analytic device
to emphasize its role in the analytic process and reduce the temptation for the analyst to “skip” the
more rigorous and demanding methods of analysis in favor of just constructing stories.

Analysis of Evidence
completeness of an analysis. Converting all of the available data into propositions
ordered in a strict chronology, at any stage, simpliﬁes the task of discovering story
possibilities that can be constructed from the available evidence. It simpliﬁes the
task of discovering gaps that need to be ﬁlled. Narratives serve similar functions.
For example, when an analysis of the available evidence has been completed shortly
before trial, the question becomes: Can the analysis be converted into a coherent
narrative that is consistent with the theory of the case and that accounts for the
available evidence, but that does not depend upon facts for which there is no
evidence? In contrast, when the analysis has been done at the investigative stage,
the question may be: Does a narrative derived from that analysis reveal gaps that
need to be ﬁlled or suggest additional lines of inquiry that need to be pursued?
Constructing chronologies and plausible narratives that might be true at that stage
can facilitate imaginative reasoning of the kind described in Chapter 2.
The methods of analysis are complementary rather than rival. Each has special
advantagesforspeciﬁcpurposesatvariousstagesofacase.Foreach,thequalityofthe

its construction and use. We believe that every lawyer should be familiar with both
methods, with the purposes for which each is best suited, and with the procedures,
the protocol, by which each may be used to maximize its advantages, as well as with
the ways in which the analytic devices can be used to facilitate and enhance the
resulting product.
2. A seven-step protocol for analysis: a generalized account
In the context of a legal dispute, three questions must always be addressed:
1 What is the ultimate proposition that must be proved?
2 What are the data that are available?
3 What are the plausible and defensible relationships between these data and the
ultimate proposition?
A method of analyzing evidence is basically a heuristic device for responding to
these questions. As such, the device should have two components – (i) a practicable
method for organizing and conducting the analysis and (ii) a system for recording
or expressing the results of the analysis in a usable form.
Experience suggests that the quality of an analysis and the resulting product are
enhanced if those engaged in the task observe a known and systematic protocol. We
believe the quality of the analysis of evidence in a legal dispute and the product that
results from that analysis are likely to be enhanced if a systematic set of procedures
is regularly employed. The protocol we have developed has seven steps:
1 Clariﬁcation of standpoint;
2 Formulation of the potential ultimate probandum or probanda;
3 Formulation of the potential penultimate probanda;
4 Formulation of the theories of the case;

5 Recording the available data;
6 Preparing the product(s); and
7 Reﬁning and completing the analysis.
Step 1. Clarify the standpoint of the analyst by giving clear and precise answers to
four questions: Who am I? At what stage in what process am I? What materials are
available for analysis? What am I trying to do?
Standpoint is always a function of four dependent variables – time, objective (or
purpose), materials available for analysis, and role. In academic law instruction,
the point in time is typically post-trial and post-appeal. For the practitioner and,
with appropriate exercises, for the student, the exercise may focus upon any stage:
reviewing a trial record for appeal, developing a closing argument based upon
evidence given, preparing a matter for trial based upon a completed investigation,
investigatingamatterinpreparationforlitigationortrial,evaluatingaclient’sclaims
in order to aid the decision whether to litigate, or even advising a client on proposed
conduct or on how to structure proposed conduct with respect to the prospect of
future litigation.
The standpoint is also a function of the objectives of the analysis. These can
usefully be divided into three main classes: organizational, evaluative, and advocacy
objectives. One of the main values of a rigorous method of analysis is as a tool
for organizing or ordering or structuring the evidence and the inferences derived
from it, as a preliminary to pursuing some other objective, such as evaluating
the “net persuasive effect” of the evidence or converting the analysis into a form
suitable for the presentation of an argument in a forum, e.g., in a negotiation or at
a trial.
For Wigmore, and for most academic analyses, the objective is ordinarily to
evaluate the evidence offered or reported to determine whether a case was rightly
or justiﬁably decided with reference to some articulated standard – for instance,
given the substantive law and the burden of proof the court found applicable,
did the evidence support the factual conclusion necessary to sustain the result
reached? This evaluative analysis may be done for different purposes – to determine
whether the lawyer could have done better on closing argument or on appeal,
whether the rules of admissibility operated to further or frustrate an inquiry to
determine truth, etc. But all such exercises start from the assumption that the
evidence presented to the trier of fact or the facts reported by the appellate court
are ﬁxed.
For example, the O. J. Simpson case is history. If we were to take the standpoint of
a historian examining the trial record, we would need to differentiate the question,
“Was the verdict justiﬁed?” from the question, “What actually happened?” It is one
thingtoask,“WasthejuryjustiﬁedinacquittingSimpsononthebasisoftheevidence
and arguments presented at trial?” It is another to ask, “Could the prosecution have
presented a stronger case at the trial than they in fact did?” And still another to ask,
“On the basis of all the evidence available today, can it now be established that it

Analysis of Evidence
is beyond reasonable doubt that O. J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of Nicole
Brown Simpson?”
An advocacy objective is typically dominant when the student or the lawyer
seeks to perform the analysis to assist in determining an appropriate course of
conduct. What additional investigation or discovery should I seek to strengthen (or
weaken) inferences necessary to the development of my client’s (or my adversary’s)
case? What evidence must I highlight, and what evidence must I seek to exclude or
minimize to develop my theory of the case?3
The objectives that can be achieved are limited by the materials available for
analysis. If the available material is a report of a decision by a court of appeal, the
analyst can only determine whether the decision was supported by the facts that
the court chose to report. She cannot determine whether the evidence presented
at trial was sufﬁcient to support a determination that the accused was guilty. She
cannot determine whether the court fairly summarized the evidence. If the material
is the trial record from a decided case, the analyst might examine the competency
of counsel in structuring and marshaling the evidence and arguments. She might
be able to make a judgment about whether the evidence was sufﬁcient to enable
the fact-ﬁnder (judge or jury) to determine that the ultimate probandum was or
was not proven to the required degree of certainty. She could not, however, deter-
mine whether the accused was guilty or innocent because she does not have access
to the evidence that was not discovered or presented. The failure to identify an
objective that can be achieved based upon the materials available is a common
error that can have serious consequences. Midway in a project, the analyst may
discover that the objective speciﬁed cannot be achieved with the data available.
Either the objective must be amended (often not possible) or the job must be
redone.
A fourth variable is role. Role is always implicit once the objective is chosen. But
it may be useful to consider the variable separately both to clarify objectives and
to reveal possible personal biases of the person doing the analysis. For example,
the lawyer preparing for trial must examine the evidence from three standpoints
and three roles in order to do the job completely: ﬁrst, the role of advocate for her
client; second, the standpoint and role of her opponent; and, ﬁnally, the role and
standpoint of the trier of fact. What is her opponent likely to adopt as his theory of
the case? To what extent will the triers of fact share the generalizations (or biases)
upon which the probative force of her analysis and marshaling of the evidence
depend?
It is always important to deﬁne standpoint carefully from the outset and at each
stage of the case. For present purposes, let us assume the role is that of a lawyer
engaged to represent a client with respect to a contested matter, the outcome of
which appears likely to depend upon the resolution of disputed questions of fact
3 The concept of a “theory of the case” and related concepts are further developed below at page 118.

(as opposed to a dispute over the controlling legal principles). Throughout, the
lawyer’s purpose will be to aid the client in determining and achieving the best
possible outcome. Under this assumption, standpoint will vary according to the
stage at which an analysis of the state of the evidence is undertaken.
The objective of the analysis, and the tools available and useful, will also differ
at different stages of a case. For example, at a ﬁrst interview the lawyer will be
listeningandprobingforfactsthatwillmakeitpossibletoframeprovisionalultimate
probanda as hypotheses. At that stage, these hypotheses will be tested by questions
framed to determine whether there appears to be evidence available that would
support each of the necessary elements of the hypotheses.
Step 2. Formulate carefully and precisely the potential ultimate probandum or
probanda. This does not come as naturally to students as an experienced lawyer
might expect. It is surprising how often students fail to see that this is a crucial
preliminary step that provides the focal point for the whole analysis. Without an
ultimateprobandumthereisnotouchstoneofrelevance;ifitisincorrectlyorloosely
formulated, the ensuing analysis is correspondingly vulnerable.
The ﬁrst step then must be to formulate (or identify) the controlling propositions
of law. The substantive propositions constitute the major premises; the ultimate
probandum or probanda are the minor premises – those propositions of fact which,
if found proven to the required degree, compel or support the conclusion that the
party with the burden must prevail. Two caveats are important. First, the ultimate
probandum should ordinarily be phrased in a way that respects the burden of proof.
The lawyers for O. J. Simpson did not have to prove that he was not guilty; it was the
prosecution’s burden to prove that he was. Second, the ultimate probandum should
not include the standard of proof. The probative force of the evidence cannot be
charted. The propositions deﬁning the burden of proof come into play after the
analysis has been completed and the task shifts to an evaluation of the probative
force of the evidence.4
In the O. J. Simpson case,5 the ultimate probandum had to be derived from the
rule of law deﬁning ﬁrst degree murder. Under Section 187(a) of the California
Penal Code, “Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being . . . with malice
aforethought.” That section might be rephrased as the major premise of a syllogism:
4 It should be clear that analysis and evaluation cannot be completely compartmentalized in practice.
As the analyst constructs an argument, she automatically appraises its strength. It is, however, useful
to maintain the distinction in applying the protocols for analysis. See Chs. 8 and 9 below.

Analysis of Evidence
If a human being, a victim, is dead, and the victim died as a result of an unlawful act, and
it was the accused who committed the act that caused the victim’s death, and the person
who committed the act that caused the victim’s death acted with malice aforethought,
then the accused is guilty of murder.
For the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson (“NBS”), the ultimate probandum
had to be a proposition that satisﬁed the conditions of that major premise. That
proposition might be framed in the abstract as:
NBS is dead; and NBS died as the result of an unlawful act; and it was Orenthal James
Simpson (“OJS”) who committed the act that caused NBS’s death; and the person who
committed the acts that caused NBS’s death acted with malice aforethought.
Step 3. Formulate the potential penultimate probanda. Ordinarily the ultimate
probandum or probanda are complex propositions with more than one condi-
tion that must be satisﬁed. Determining the penultimate probanda, initially and at
a minimum, requires that the analysts convert the complex ultimate probandum
into a compound proposition and partition (and often sub-partition) that propo-
sition into its component simple propositions. Once these penultimate probanda
have been tentatively formulated, the lawyer should be in a position to visualize the
overall structure of the case.

2 NBS died as the result of an unlawful act.
3 It was OJS who committed the act that caused NBS’s death.
4 The person who committed the acts that caused NBS’s death acted with malice
aforethought.
Step 4. Formulate the provisional theories of the case. The theory of the case is the
logical statement formulated as an argument supporting one or more conclusions
about the case as a whole. In Simpson, the only penultimate probandum in dis-
pute was proposition three (identity): It was OJS who committed the act that
caused NBS’s death.6 In that case, a central problem for the prosecution was to
develop a credible theory that would explain why OJS would have committed the
6 Simpson provides a good illustration of the importance of developing a coherent and consistent
theory. Theoretically, defense counsel could have disputed proposition 4 (intent) by claiming the
person who murdered NBS acted in the heat of passion. As a practical matter, the theory that the
defense adopted forced them to take the position that proposition 4 was irrelevant to the defense.
The defense denied that it was OJS who did the stabbing and offered evidence suggesting that there
were others who might have done it. Having committed themselves to a reasonable-doubt-about-
proposition 3 theory, they could not credibly argue that it was not OJS, but if it was OJS he was
acting in the heat of passion. A trial lawyer may develop alternative theories, but she may not present
conﬂicting theories, at least not in a jury trial.

murders – to identify a credible motive.7 The prosecution elected to proceed on a
theory of control, a theory that might be summarized as follows:
OJS had expressed jealous rage resulting in violence in his attempts to control
NBS and prevent her from ﬁnally severing their relationship. His continuing
jealous rage gave him a motive to murder her as the ultimate act of control, and
the brutal manner in which she was murdered by multiple stab wounds shows
that she was murdered by someone acting in a rage. OJS was the only person who
had acted against NBS in a jealous rage. He had a motive to try to maintain his
control and to prevent NBS from acting independently, and he went to her house
to kill her as the ultimate act of control. Therefore, it was OJS who murdered
NBS in a jealous rage.8
Partitioning the ultimate probandum into simple declarative sentences that con-
stitute the penultimate probanda identiﬁes the principal “facts of consequence” in
the case.9 The speciﬁcation of a provisional theory of the case makes it possible
to use a penultimate probandum as a “magnet” to attract the relevant evidential
propositions.
For example, in order to prove that “it was OJS who committed the acts that
caused NBS’s death,” the prosecution had to prove that OJS had an opportunity to
commit the acts. Thus, the analyst might look for evidential propositions bearing
upon the time of NBS’s death and the time OJS was subsequently observed because
they would be relevant to the proposition, “OJS had an opportunity to commit the
violent acts that caused NBS’s death.”
A post-trial analyst might use the “opportunity magnet” to examine the
database – the evidence admitted during the trial. Using that magnet, her key-
list would include relevant evidential propositions derived directly from the data.
For example, Pablo Fuentes, who lived near NBS’s house, testiﬁed that he had heard
the plaintive wail of a dog at 10:15 p.m. on the evening the murder was committed.
Other witnesses testiﬁed that they later had found NBS’s dog wailing and with blood
on its paws. From these propositions, the jury might have inferred the propositions
necessary to demonstrate the logical relationship of those evidential propositions
7 Theprosecutiondoesnothavetoprovemotiveinacriminalcase;itisnotapenultimateprobandum.
Motive, if it exists, is relevant to show it was the accused who committed the act that caused the
victim’s death. It may also be relevant to intent. In Simpson and in many cases, however, it is
difﬁcult, sometimes impossible, to persuade a jury to convict without providing a persuasive reason
explaining why the accused did it.
8 See Schmalleger (1996) 57–59 (excerpt from “The Prosecution’s Opening Statement”). There were
alternate theories that the prosecution might have chosen. For example, the prosecution team
reportedly considered, but rejected, an “exploding bomb” theory: OJS went to NBS’s house that
evening intending to vent his anger by committing an act of vandalism, such as slashing the tires
on her car. His anger “exploded” when he found NBS with another man, Ronald Goldman (RLG),
in the yard in front of her house.
9 Once a witness has taken the stand, her credibility also becomes a fact of consequence. It should be
clear that all of the evidential data offered at trial must be relevant to either one or more penultimate
probandaortothecredibilityofawitness.SeeChapter2onrelevance(pages62–63)andtestimonial
credibility (pages 65–70).

Analysis of Evidence
to a penultimate probandum – e.g., the plaintive wail of the dog that belonged to
NBS and had blood on its paws supported an inference that the wailing was caused
by the dog’s discovery that its mistress was dead, supporting the further inference
that the murder occurred at or shortly after 10:15 p.m. Detective Vanetter testiﬁed
that it took ﬁve minutes to drive from NBS’s house to OJS’s house. Alan Park, a
chauffeur who was waiting for OJS, testiﬁed that a recently showered and calm and
collected OJS emerged from his house at 11:00 p.m. to be driven to the airport. This
testimony and the evidence supporting an inference that NBS died at 10:15 p.m.
provided the basis upon which the prosecution had to persuade the jury that OJS
had an opportunity to commit the murders – i.e. that he could have been present
at NBS’s house at 10:15 p.m. and still have returned home, showered, disposed of
his bloody garments, collected himself, and emerged from his house at 11:00 p.m.
In other instances, it may be easier to start with an evidential proposition and
reason “upward” to develop the inferred propositions that clarify its relevance. In
the previous example, an analyst might initially ask why the testimony about a dog’s
wailingat10:15p.m.wasrelevant,andworkupwarduntilshesawthatitwasrelevant
to establishing the time of NBS’s death and that establishing the time of NBS’s death
was necessary to determine whether OJS could have had an opportunity to kill
NBS. Often, the need to reason upward occurs when pieces of the puzzle are “left
over” – i.e. evidential data that seem relevant remain unused after the penultimate
“magnets” have been applied to the entire mass of available evidential data. The
process of ﬁtting these leftover pieces into the puzzle often forces revisions of the
theory and penultimate probanda.
Until the ﬁnal analysis is complete, the theories must remain provisional, subject
to revision as the analysis proceeds. If the problem is a complex one involving a mass
of evidence, it is highly likely that there will be a range of possible theories each of
which could lead the analysis in signiﬁcantly different directions. In order to make
the task manageable, it may be necessary to eliminate some possibilities and con-
centrate on one or more speciﬁc theories. Even historians and scientists do not have
inﬁnite time and resources to pursue endless lines of inquiry. Typically advocates
have to develop a provisional theory that will guide their analysis at an early stage.
Until the analysis is complete, they must remember that the theory is provisional
and remains open to being revised or even changed as the analysis proceeds.
The task of the lawyer is simpler than that of other analysts, such as the historian
or the intelligence analyst. The lawyer has an opponent who will try to organize and
marshal the evidence to prevent her adversary from prevailing. The lawyer can often
limit the number of potential theories that should be examined by formulating the
strongest potential theory or theories of the case for her opponent. The theories
that need to be examined are those that, given the available evidence, hold the most

10 In Chs. 6 and 10 we shall explore in some detail the nature of such theories, their relationship to
“story,” “situation,” and “theme” in the context of advocacy, and their functions at different stages
of litigation.

Step 5. Recording the available data. The evidential data must be recorded in
propositional form. The dynamic nature of the development of a case over time
makes it necessary that the lawyer have some adaptable generic devices that can
be employed to record the data in an organized form and that can be expanded as
the case develops. One common device of this kind is the chronology. Chronolo-
gies can be developed in two forms. One form is a chronology based upon the
individual witnesses, documents, or other items of evidence. For each potential
witness and exhibit place the events that can be asserted or shown in chrono-
logical order. The other form is a master chronology, which places each of the
propositions supported by the data in a temporal sequence, indexed to the wit-
nesses or documents by which they are to be established. So ordered, these propo-
sitions describe the events that are known or believed to have occurred in the
precise sequence in which they occurred. Such a chronology sets the events and
documents in the order in which they occurred, the order in which most people
think.
As an analytic device, the chronology serves two functions. It helps the lawyer see
where there are temporal gaps that need to be ﬁlled or explained. Moreover, it helps
thelawyerseenarratives,“storypossibilities,”thatmightexplaintheeventstakenasa
whole. Both devices enable the lawyer to identify areas where further investigation is
necessary and should be productive. Because the chronology is ordered temporally,
it can be revised and expanded as new evidential data are obtained.11 In most cases,
a lawyer should begin to develop a master chronology rather early. Later in the case,
a fully developed chronology may provide the framework for presenting the theory
of the case as a story in the opening statement.
Throughout all stages of the process, steps 1 through 5 are reﬂexive. The analyst
needs to have a provisional ultimate probandum to identify possible theories and
to establish some basis for selecting lines of investigation that are likely to produce
relevant evidential data. At the outset, however, the lawyer needs some factual asser-
tions (ordinarily the client’s statements) in order to identify potentially applicable
principles of law that will enable her to frame ultimate and penultimate probanda
as provisional hypotheses. The hypotheses so framed and the provisional theory
adopted will guide further investigation, and that investigation, in turn, is likely to
generate data that will require that the probanda and the theory be revised or that
new or additional ones be provisionally adopted.
Two points merit emphasis. First, in processes such as interviewing and investi-
gation, these four steps are likely to be useful in differing sequences. Second, at any
stage where the lawyer undertakes a comprehensive analysis to determine the state
of the case at that time, each step will be required even though the probanda are
provisional and the data incomplete.
11 Some cases require alternative or additional generic devices. For example, if the location at which
the events occurred is critical, physical diagrams or models may be important analytic devices.
So too, in a products liability case, engineering models and blueprints may be necessary. In other
complex cases, devices from other ﬁelds may be useful – for example, economic analysis in an
antitrust case or statistical analysis in an employment discrimination case.

Analysis of Evidence
Step 6. Preparing the product(s). The product produced is a function of the method
chosen – a key-list and chart in the chart method or an outline for the outline
method. These methods and analytic devices overlap in ways that make it possible
to convert material generated by an analytical device into the product of one of
the methods of analysis and to transfer material recorded for one method into the
product of the other. For example, the propositions in a master chronology are
propositions that will appear in an outline and propositions from the chronology
and the outline will appear in a key-list and chart.
Step 7. Reﬁning and completing the analysis. Whatever the product, the objective is
to develop a logically sound analysis that, in light of the analyst’s speciﬁc objectives,
organizes a mass of evidence and identiﬁes the inferences necessary to relate all
signiﬁcant relevant data to the ultimate proposition in issue. Typically, the process
of revision and reﬁnement is continuous, with judgments previously made being
revised in each succeeding step of the analysis to deal with any gaps discovered or
ﬂaws in the reasoning that are revealed as the process proceeds. It is, however, the
chart and key-list, or the outline completed through step 6, that makes it possible to
analyze and evaluate the case-as-a-whole and to test the judgments initially made.
This is where the true value of the analysis as both intellectual exercise and practical
work emerges most clearly. For that reason, the ﬁnal analysis of the whole should
be done as a separate step.
Exercise
Read and review the O. J. Simpson problem in Chapter 1. Prepare a list of the
propositions concerning opportunity in chronological order. Develop an opportu-
nity theory that would support the prosecution’s claim that the evidence showed
beyond reasonable doubt that OJS could have murdered NBS and RLG. Develop a
defense theory that would support the defense’s claim that it cannot be established
beyond reasonable doubt that OJS could have murdered NBS and RLG. Both the
prosecution and the defense theories must account for the three thumps that Kato
Kaelin testiﬁed he had heard around 10:45 p.m. and the black man in dark clothes
that Alan Parks testiﬁed he had seen approaching the house at 10:55 p.m.

The chart method
A. The chart method: an overview
The chart method of analysis is the most rigorous of the three methods of analysis
identiﬁed above. It is a technique that enables the analyst to construct, test, and
reconstruct arguments about questions of fact. It requires that the analyst articulate
every step in an argument, breaking down the argument into simple propositions,
and then mapping or “charting” all the relations between those propositions and the
penultimate probanda (or the components of a hypothesis). The logic is simple; the
complexity lies in the materials to be analyzed and in identifying the relationships
between the propositions in an extensive argument based on a mass of conﬂicting
evidence. The logic is binary: Every relevant proposition either tends to support or
tends to negate a single hypothesis or conclusion (the ultimate probandum). The
technique is dialectical: The aim of the chart-maker should be to construct the most
cogent possible argument for and against the ultimate conclusion and to relate the
opposing arguments within a single coherent structure.
The chart method structures the analysis at two levels – the macroscopic level
and the microscopic level. The macroscopic level involves structuring the “top” of
the chart. The ultimate and penultimate probanda must be determined based upon
the law and, usually, restated after the analyst has formulated a provisional theory
of the case. The penultimate probanda help the analyst identify which of the main
propositions must be established to support each of the penultimate probanda.
Ordinarily, there are subordinate probanda that can be immediately identiﬁed.
For example, in a murder case the central question often is, “Was it the accused
who committed the act that caused the victim’s death?” In such a case, the analyst
must recognize that any evidence that supports an inference that the accused had
opportunity or motive may be important. The subordinate propositions become
metaphorical magnets the analyst can use in sorting the evidence and organizing
different phases of the argument into discrete, manageable sectors. The key lies in
anchoring the arguments about the case as a whole in a deﬁned standpoint, clear
questions, and precisely formulated hypotheses or conclusions.
The microscopic level requires precise and detailed analysis of the evidential
data for each important phase of the argument. This “microscopic analysis” is

Analysis of Evidence
arduousandtime-consumingwork.However,withpractice,theanalystlearnssome
basic principles of economy, by identifying crucial or important phases within an
argument and focusing mainly on these. If a person’s jugular vein is severed, death
is almost inevitable. In advocacy “going for the jugular” means concentrating one’s
attack on the weakest point in an opponent’s argument or, more positively, building
up support for a proposition which, if established, will ensure success. The chart
method of analysis is particularly useful for identifying potentially key propositions
that can be used to build or destroy a case.
The two main products that distinguish the chart method from other methods of
analysis are a “key-list” of all the propositions used in the argument and a detailed
map showing how propositions inferred from the evidential data can be logically
marshaled to provide the strongest arguments in support of and against the ultimate
probandum. The method is disciplined and systematic, but a chart is a picture of
the chart-maker’s beliefs about what constitutes the strongest argument. Judgment,
selection, skill, and analytical capacity are required at every stage. The chart method
is an aid to disciplined analysis, construction, and criticism of arguments; it should
not be viewed as a substitute for thinking.
B. The seven-step protocol for the chart method:
a detailed account
Mastering Wigmore’s chart method of analysis is similar to mastering any complex
analytical skill. In learning it, you should try to cultivate the habit of going through
a regular sequence of operations step-by-step. Steps 1 through 4 and 7 are common
to all methods; steps 5 and 6 must be adapted to the chart method. To provide a
solid foundation, we present a more detailed account of each of the steps, adapted
to the chart method, using the United States v. Able case from Chapter 1 (page 23).
Step1.Clarifying standpoint. The analyst must answer the four basic questions at the
outset of any analysis project: Who am I? At what stage in what process am I? What
materials are available for analysis? What am I trying to do? The consequences of
failing to respond carefully to each of these questions can be dramatic and traumatic
inapplyingthechartmethod.Atsomepointintryingtodevelopthechartedanalysis,
usually after the investment of substantial time and effort, the deﬁciency is more
likely to become apparent because the precision required for the chart method
makes it far more difﬁcult to overlook any deﬁciencies.
For purposes of learning how to apply the chart method, it is often helpful to
adopt the standpoint of a historian making an ex post facto judgment about what
happened (the event) on the basis of a ﬁnite body of evidence. In this context, a
historian might deﬁne and pursue a single objective – the construction and eval-
uation of the arguments for and against a speciﬁc conclusion. For example, she
might seek to answer the question: Could a rational fact-ﬁnder have concluded
that the evidence in the Sacco and Vanzetti (page 21) case, after the revelation that

bullet III could not have been ﬁred from the gun that ﬁred bullets I, II, and IV,
established beyond a reasonable doubt that it was Sacco who ﬁred the shot that
killed Berardelli?1
Adopting the standpoint of a historian can serve to isolate the tasks of analysis
and evaluation from other tasks. Historians do not have to concern themselves with
proceduraltechnicalities,admissibility,questionsofrole,tactics,ethicalconstraints,
or other “noise” factors to the same extent as participants in actual trials. On the
other hand, historians do not have a formal concept of materiality that deﬁnes the
ultimate probandum.2
In analyzing trial records, law students often ﬁnd it difﬁcult to keep separate
the concept of the original event (Did X happen?) and the proceedings at trial,
which may have involved lack of due process, poor or unethical advocacy, or bias
or prejudice on the part of the judge or jury (Did the evidence presented justify the
result?). None of the latter factors should inﬂuence a historian’s judgment about
the original event. Trial records are useful sources of evidence for a historian, but
they may involve “noise” factors that are irrelevant to a historical judgment about
the original event rather than the trial.
In Able, our standpoint might be stated as follows. Who are we? We are the
lawyers representing Richard Able in United States v. Able. The case is ready for trial
and discovery has closed. The evidence in the case ﬁle is the only material available.
We are preparing the case for trial and seek to marshal the available evidence and
inferences to maximize the likelihood that Able will be found not guilty.
Step2. Formulating the ultimate probandum. For every case, the lawyer must identify
the rule or rules of law that will (or that she believes will) control the case and
formulate a proposition or propositions of fact, the ultimate probandum, that must
be proved in order to satisfy the conditions required by the rule or rules. For United
States v. Able, we could have looked at the Internal Revenue Code for the proposition
of law that the government’s ultimate probandum must satisfy, but for present
purposes we need only look at the indictment. Because the court has denied Able’s
motion to dismiss, it was established for this case, at the trial level, that the facts
alleged in the indictment, if proved, are sufﬁcient to support a guilty verdict.3
1 See Schum and Kadane (1996) for a full analysis.
2 Of course, historians are not of one kind. They too have to be concerned with objectives, biases, and
context. Even for the historian standpoint, role and objectives need to be deﬁned with precision.
See Twining and Hampsher-Monk (2003), esp. Geller, “The Last Wedge” (at 122) and Anderson,
“WigmoreMeets‘TheLastWedge’”(at140)foranillustrationoftheapplicationofthechartmethod
to a historical problem. Other published applications of the chart method include Anderson (1999)
(Huddleston); Dingley (1999) (The Ballpoint case – cf. the approach of Feteris (1999) to the same
case); Wigmore, Science (Umilian and Hatchett).
3 Our motion to dismiss the indictment would have asserted that the indictment failed to allege facts
sufﬁcient to state a violation of Section 7201 of the Internal Revenue Code, i.e. that it failed to
allege an ultimate probandum that satisﬁed the conditions mandated using Section 7201 as a major
premise. Given our standpoint, the issues raised by that motion are matters to be considered by
appellate counsel in the event Able is convicted.
