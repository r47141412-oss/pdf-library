Evaluating evidence

in our system of Evidence, prescribing for the jury the precise effect of any general or
special class of evidence. So far as logic and psychology assist us, their conclusions show
that it is out of the question to make a general assertion ascribing greater weight to one
class or the other. The probative effect of one or more pieces of either sort of evidence
depends upon considerations too complex. Science can only point out that each class
has its special dangers and its special advantages. (1 Wigmore on Evidence §26 (Tillers
Rev. 1983))
To say that there are no rules of weight means that the law does not prescribe
generalrulesconcerningtheweightorcogencyofparticulartypesofevidencesuchas
confessions, eyewitness identiﬁcation evidence, or ﬁngerprints. There are, however,
ways in which some limited control is exercised over evaluation of evidence. For
example, in many common law jurisdictions a judge has a duty to warn the trier
of fact about the potential unreliability of eyewitness identiﬁcation evidence.3 In
England directions to a jury may include advice on evaluation of certain phases
of the evidence and such guidance is sometimes included in specimen directions
prepared by the Judicial Studies Board. Judges may withdraw a case from a jury on
the grounds of insufﬁcient evidence (see below). Bentham drew a sharp distinction
between rules addressed to the will (binding) and instructions addressed to the
understanding (guidance). Almost without exception this distinction is maintained
by the law of evidence throughout the common law world.
2. Traditional modes of expressing weight and probative force
There is a useful analogy between grading examinations and evaluating evidence.
One obvious point of similarity has to do with the extent to which both modes of
decision-makingaresusceptibletorationalguidance,justiﬁcation,andcriticism.We
all hope that grading is not a completely arbitrary, irrational, hit-or-miss process;
but few would deny that there is an inescapable personal element at the point
of decision. So with the weighing of evidence. Less obvious is the point that, in
discussing what is involved in the conscientious marking of examinations and the
weighing of evidence, it is important to distinguish among a number of questions.
In examining, we distinguish between conventional modes of expressing marks or
grades (percentage; alphabetical grading; pass/fail); standards required for attaining
a particular result (e.g., the standards for the pass mark, for awarding a distinction
or credit); the criteria used in awarding marks or the reasons for making particular
evaluations(e.g.,marksgivenforaccuracy,originality,orgoodanalysisorsubtracted
for errors, omissions, or even illegibility); how to combine judgments about grades,
especially when they are based on multiple criteria; and the extent to which such
criteria can be embodied in rules.
In evaluating evidence, we need to make some similar distinctions. In partic-
ular we need to distinguish among the following questions, even though they are
intimately related in both theory and practice:

Analysis of Evidence
1 How can we express assessments of weight (the vocabulary of evaluation, analogous to
a marking scheme)?
2 What are the standards for decision of factual issues (cf. the pass mark)?
3 How can judgments of weight and probative force be combined?
4 What are the criteria for evaluating the probative force of individual items of evidence
or the weight of a “mass” of evidence in a given case (cf. reasons for awarding or
debiting marks or awarding a particular overall grade)?
5 To what extent could the law of evidence prescribe rules of weight or evaluation
(cf. marking rules)?
Whatever the possibility of developing principles of evaluation, there is an estab-
lished vocabulary by which degrees of persuasion and probative force are expressed
in forensic and other contexts. It is perhaps noteworthy how little the vocabulary
has changed over the past two centuries.
In the ﬁrst place, it has been observed by a very learned Man, that there are several
Degrees from perfect Certainty and Demonstration, quite down to Improbability and
Unlikeliness, even to the conﬁnes of Impossibility; and there are several Acts of the
Mind proportioned to these degrees of Evidence, which may be called the Degrees of
Assent, from full Assurance and Conﬁdence, quite down to Conjecture, Doubt, Distrust
and Disbelief. (J. Gilbert (1754) 1)
Certainty, absolute certainty, is a satisfaction which on every ground of inquiry we are
continually grasping at, but which the inexorable nature of things has placed forever out
of reach. Practical certainty, a degree of assurance sufﬁcient for practice, is a blessing,
the attainment of which, as often as it lies in our way to attain it, may be sufﬁcient
to console us under the want of any such superﬂuous and unattainable acquisitions.
(Bentham (1827) vol. 5: 351)
In talking about inferences, it is common to resort to metaphor: We talk of the
weight of the evidence, of prejudicial effect outweighing probative value, of the
persuasive force or the probative force of an argument, of the strength of support,
or of a weak case. Yet we do not normally seek to express differences or to measure
such matters in terms of grams or ohms or watts or volts or pounds per square inch
or other physical measures.
There is a variety of contexts in which judgments concerning evidence are com-
monly expressed as probability judgments, although not always identiﬁed as such.
For example, it is common to express probability judgments on a conventional
scale of 0 to 1. Similarly, the strength of a judgment may be expressed in terms of
percentages (e.g., it is 60 percent probable that X is the murderer); or of wagering
odds (e.g., I would bet three to one that X is the murderer). There are also standard
formulations by which beliefs are expressed in subjective (I am conﬁdent that X is
the murderer) or objective (the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that X is
the murderer) terms that connote a probabilistic judgment.
The conventions for marking examinations illustrate, in an analogous context,
some of the concerns that the use of the term “probability” raises. The adoption of a

convention that expresses marks or grades in terms of numbers or Roman or Greek
letters or some other mode of expression (e.g., Excellent – Worthless) tells us little
or nothing of the criteria used for making such judgments. In expressing judgments
about evidence or exam papers, however, using numbers makes it easier, and more
tempting, to add, subtract, multiply, or perform other mathematical calculations to
create an appearance of precision and objectivity; but whether a particular mode of
calculation or whether calculating at all is appropriate are separate questions. Some
of the central debates in the theory of evidence address such questions in respect
to weighing or assessing the probative force of evidence. These controversies are
introducedinChapter9.Inthischapter,weareconcernedwithonlythreequestions:
First,whataretheconventions forexpressingdecisionsorjudgmentsaboutprobative
forceorweight,independentlyofanyparticularcriteria forarrivingatsuchdecisions
or judgments? Second, what are the criteria or standards the decision-maker is to
use in making the required decisions and judgments? Third, what, if any, is the legal
signiﬁcance of the various criteria and standards?
In legal discourse, terms that connote an assessment of probability are com-
monly invoked. Lawyers, judges, and commentators also talk of the credibility of
evidence and of witnesses, of the plausibility of an argument, and of the likelihood
that an event occurred or will occur. In some contexts, such terms are used synony-
mously with probability.4 For purposes of the present chapter, we shall use the term
“probability” in its conventional sense as a general term for expressing judgments
about the probative force and effect of evidence without any necessary commit-
ment to any particular criteria for assessing the correctness of particular judgments
of probability; in short we shall use the term broadly to embrace both “objective”
and “subjective,” mathematical (“Pascalian”) and nonmathematical (“Baconian”),
theories of probability.
Againstthatbackground,onemightconstructa“probabilitytable,”whichgrades
both mathematical and nonmathematical probability judgments on a ten-point
scale.
For different purposes the number of gradations are sometimes increased or
reduced. For example, most English university law faculties express marks in per-
centages, but according to convention the normal range is on a 50-point scale, for
almost no one gets more than 80 percent and only disastrous performances rate
less than 30 percent. A standard alphabetical system of marking along the sequence
A++, A+, A . . . C++, . . . F has approximately 20 gradations, sometimes extended
by the craven insertion of queries (e.g., B-??, B+?+). Some examinations have two
grades: Pass/Fail. In the present context the moral is clear: The mode of expressing
4 For some people, however, the term “probability” is indissolubly associated with certain forms of
mathematical reasoning and calculation so that to them it seems paradoxical, even heretical, to
talk of “nonmathematical probabilities.” In this view, it may be perfectly acceptable to claim that
it is inappropriate to quantify the plausibility of an argument, the criminal standard of proof, the
credibility of a witness, or the likelihood of some claim being true (though this is, perhaps, more
controversial), but any judgment of probability must by deﬁnition be expressed or at least capable
of being expressed numerically. These views are discussed in Ch. 9.

judgments concerning degrees of probative force is usually a matter of convention,
in which there is no magic in the numbers.
The moral for lawyers and law students should be clear. Judges and juries must
in some way “grade” the evidence each time they are required to make an evaluative
decisionconcerningevidence,whetherthedecisiontakestheformofajudge’sdecid-
ing whether the improper prejudicial effect substantially outweighs the probative
value of proffered evidence or the jury’s deciding whether the evidence establishes
the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or whether it shows that the plain-
tiff’s ultimate probandum is more probable than not. In practice, these judgments
are ordinarily expressed on a binary scale – evidence is admitted or not admitted,
objections are sustained or overruled, the jury’s verdict is guilty or not guilty, for
the plaintiff in a speciﬁc amount or for the defendant. Nonetheless, both judges
and juries are expected to weigh the evidence in terms of probabilistic assessments
of the probative force of the parts and of the whole. For that reason, lawyers must
know and be able to frame their arguments using the conventional vocabularies by
which such arguments and judgments are expressed.
C. Standards for decision
Traditional works on the law of evidence tend to focus on the contested jury trial and
the standards of proof that are applicable to adjudicative decisions at ﬁrst instance,
notably the civil standard (balance of probabilities, preponderance of evidence) and

the criminal standard (proof beyond reasonable doubt). These are, of course, very
important. However, if one adopts a total process model of litigation that involves a
variety of speciﬁc decisions by different participants pre-trial and post-trial, as well
as at trial, other standards for decision also need to be considered.
Adjudicative decisions are indeed a focal point of litigation, both because they are
important in themselves and because they “cast a long shadow” on other decisions
thatprecedeorcomeafterthem.Forexample,adecisiontoprosecuteortopleadnot
guilty must take into account the likelihood of a decision to acquit or convict by the
trier of fact. This in turn requires an assessment of the net persuasive effect that the
evidence would be likely to have on the trier of fact. Similarly, many post-conviction
decisions have to treat the decision of the trier of fact as given or, exceptionally, to
consider whether it should be overturned. Nevertheless, it is important to bear in
mind that both analysis and evaluation are typically involved in all these decisions
and that evaluation is typically governed by different standards with respect to the
different kinds of decisions that must be made.
In this context, there are three propositions that should be axiomatic. First,
there are accepted standards that are intended to provide guidance for almost every
decision that requires consideration of evidence in a legal context. Second, almost
all those decisions require not only that the evidence be analyzed so that potential
logical relationships may be identiﬁed, but also that it be evaluated to determine the
relative strength of the inferences for which it may logically be claimed to provide
some support. Third, however articulated, the standards for decision are usually
framed in terms intended to provide guidance in evaluation as well as analysis.
From the standpoint of the practitioner there is a further distinction that should
be equally axiomatic. The standards for decision can be usefully separated into two
categories. In one category are those standards that are prescribed to impose limits
on the decision-maker’s exercise of discretion; for instance, standards of review such
as whether the evidence was logically sufﬁcient to support the decision below. In
the other category are those standards intended to guide a decision-maker in the
exercise of assigned discretion, such as a standard that the jury must be satisﬁed
beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case. The axioms and the importance of
the distinctions are illustrated in the sections that follow.
1. Lawyering standards
The resolution of any legal dispute may require decisions by at least ﬁve kinds
of decision-makers: the parties (or clients), their lawyers (including prosecutors),
the trial judge, jurors, and appellate judges. There are standards established by
conventional wisdom, ethical norm, or legal rule for virtually every decision that
must be taken at any stage of the process. The purpose of this section is to illustrate
thispointbrieﬂywithreferencetoexamplesoflawyer-clientdecisionsandofpretrial
decisions that are ordinarily made by lawyers.

Analysis of Evidence
a. Standards for lawyer-client decisions
In the common law system of adjudication, clients and lawyers, as well as adjudica-
tors, are decision-makers. Ethical considerations, rules of professional conduct, and
practical realities dictate that there is a variety of decisions in which the lawyer and
the client must participate; these rules identify decisions on which the lawyer must
ordinarily defer to the client. Many of these decisions depend signiﬁcantly upon
an assessment of the state of the known evidence and its probable effect upon the
decision-maker, such as a defendant’s decision to accept a proposed plea bargain or
to waive or to seek or demand a trial by jury.
In civil cases, lawyers ordinarily apply some rather straightforward utilitarian
standards in making decisions about whether a claim should be pursued, settled,
or abandoned. Many of these decisions require that the available and potentially
available evidence be evaluated in order to assess the likelihood that one party will
prevail on liability questions and the probable value to that party of the damages or
other relief that would be awarded if liability is established. These determinations
must then be balanced against the potential risks and probable costs involved in
pursuing the claim.
Standards for deciding whether to undertake a case and whether and on what
basis to settle it may illustrate the point. Decision theorists and economists have
tried to develop utilitarian standards that they argue should serve to guide lawyers
and clients in evaluating and settling a legal dispute. A simpliﬁed approach might
be stated as follows:
Most cases should be settled, and the decision to take, prosecute, or settle a case can
be reduced to a simple set of formulae that should be commonplace among lawyers. In
almost every instance, there are only four variables that need be considered – the state
of the law, the state of the evidence, the amount or value of the possible recovery, and
the legal fees and costs likely to be incurred in achieving the result. At any time during a
case, the lawyer’s assessment of the probability that the court will apply a speciﬁc rule of
law and of the probability that the then available evidence will persuade the fact-ﬁnder
to impose liability upon the defendant under that rule provide a basis for calculating the
probability that liability, “PL,” will be imposed. The elements or heads of damages as a
matter of law and the evidence available to prove the amount of damages recoverable
in the particular case should sufﬁce to enable a competent lawyer similarly to assess the
probable amount of the anticipated damage award, “PD,” at any stage. What is left is for
the lawyer for each side to estimate the legal costs and fees, “CF,” likely to be required,
from that point forward, to litigate the matter to conclusion. This information should
sufﬁce to enable the lawyers for each side to make a reasoned assessment of the probable
value of the case, “PV,” at any stage.
In their simplest form, these decisions can be expressed for American litigation as
follows:
For plaintiff:
PV = (PL × PD) – CF
(as assessed by plaintiff and his or her
counsel)

Evaluating evidence
233
For defendant:
PV = (PL × PD) + CF
(as assessed by defendant and his or
her counsel)
Although mathematics provides tools of sufﬁcient sophistication to deal with more
variables and may provide greater sophistication in reaching decisions, basic principles
for evaluating the typical case can be simply devised and might be expressed as follows:
1. In ordinary circumstances, no lawyer should undertake a case for a potential plaintiff
unless PV > 0 by an amount sufﬁcient to compensate for the fact that the client will
lose the estimated amount of the costs and fees and for the costs and burdens
(economic and psychological) incidental to pursuing the claim.
2. In ordinary circumstances, cases should be settled whenever the sum of the future
costs and fees to both sides exceeds the difference between the probable values as
assessed by the clients and their respective lawyers, or whenever:
[PL × PD (plaintiff)] – [PL × PD (defendant)] ≤CF (pff) + CF (def)
If lawyers understood simple decision analysis, there might be fewer trials, wealthier
clients, and the economy would have eliminated substantial transaction costs.
Questions
1 The standards above are offered to guide lawyers (and clients) in the exercise of
discretion. What, if any, standards deﬁne the limits of that discretion?
2 Review Sargent v. Southern Accident Company (page 28).
a What factors should a lawyer have considered in deciding whether she should
undertake to represent the Sargent family? Should it have made a difference, from
her standpoint, whether she ordinarily charged an hourly rate or a contingent
(percentage of recovery) fee for her services? Assuming either arrangement was
permissible and was agreeable to the Sargent family, how should the lawyer have
decided which method of charging was preferable? Which of the factors that she
should have considered require an assessment of the evidence as it bore upon the
probable outcome of the case?
b From the standpoint of the Sargent family, what advice should they have required
from the lawyer before deciding whether to pursue the claim or to retain this
speciﬁc lawyer for the matter? Suppose the lawyer advised that her ﬁrm would
undertake the matter for actual costs (deposition transcripts, ﬁling fees, etc.) plus
either a standard hourly billing rate of $200 an hour or a contingent fee of thirty
percent (30%) of the amount recovered? If the Sargents liked the lawyer, how
should they have proceeded to decide upon the fee? What legal or ethical duties
would the lawyer have in advising the Sargents with respect to this decision?
c Assume (1) that the lawyers representing the Sargents had agreed to represent
them for a fee of $200 an hour plus any amounts expended for costs and the ﬁrm
representing the insurance company had agreed to represent it for a fee of $150 an
hour plus any amounts expended for costs; (2) that the Sargents have paid their
lawyers $20,000 in fees and $10,000 for costs to date and that the insurance

company paid their lawyers $15,000 in fees and $10,000 for costs to date; (3) (i) that
the lawyers for the Sargents have estimated that they will need to spend 60 more
hours to prepare and try the case and that the costs from this point through the end
of the trial will be about $8,000 and (ii) that the lawyers for the insurance company
have given similar estimates of the fees and costs to be incurred if the case is
tried.
i How should the claims supervisor have proceeded to decide upon the maximum
amount the company should offer to settle the case before trial? What strategy
would you have employed as counsel for the company to achieve a successful
settlement?
ii How should the Sargents have decided on the minimum amount they would
accept to settle the case? What strategy would you have employed as counsel for
the Sargents to achieve a successful settlement?
d How would the formulae for deciding to take or settle a case differ under a system
that requires the losing party to pay the winning party’s legal costs and fees (“the
costs follow the event”)? In view of this analysis, what policies are furthered by
each of the systems?
b. Standards for lawyers’ decisions
The signiﬁcance of lawyer decisions and the extent to which these decisions are
subject to standards are matters that are not frequently analyzed in books on evi-
dence or trial practice. Ordinarily it is the lawyers who effectively direct the course
of pre-trial pleading and discovery. By their discovery decisions, lawyers have the
power to impose burdens on or to frustrate the legitimate objectives of the adverse
party to the litigation. Similarly, lawyers have the power to impose signiﬁcant bur-
dens on the court as well as on the adverse party through their decisions concerning
which motions should be ﬁled and how vigorously each should be documented
and pursued. In the United States, there is substantial literature and other evidence
suggesting that lawyers involved in large cases use these powers for reasons that
may be largely unrelated to achieving a prompt and fair adjudication of a disputed
claim.5 Some examples should illustrate the point.
(i) The decision to ﬁle a complaint
The range of a lawyer’s discretion in ﬁling a complaint (or other pleading) in a civil
case has been the subject of extensive litigation in the United States. Lawyers are the
ofﬁcers of the court who make the ﬁnal decision to ﬁle a civil complaint. American
law prescribes standards (either directly or through the rules of the profession)
that they are required to apply in deciding whether to initiate a case and, if so, what
allegations may properly be made in an initial or subsequent pleading. For example,
Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Procedure in the United States provides:
5 See, e.g., John D. Shugrue, “Identifying and Combating Discovery Abuse,” 23 Litigation No. 2
(Fall 1997) 10 (for an illustration and description); see also Symposium Conference on Discovery,
39 Boston Coll. L. Rev. (1998) 517–840 (for a more comprehensive overview).

Rule 11 – Signing of Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers; Representations to Court;
Sanctions
(a) Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper shall be signed by at
least one attorney of record in the attorney’s individual name, or, if the party is not
represented by an attorney, shall be signed by the party. Each paper shall state the
signer’s address and telephone number, if any. Except when otherwise speciﬁcally
provided by rule or statute, pleadings need not be veriﬁed or accompanied by
afﬁdavit. An unsigned paper shall be stricken unless omission of the signature is
corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or party.
(b) Representations to Court. By presenting to the court (whether by signing, ﬁl-
ing, submitting, or later advocating) a pleading, written motion, or other paper,
an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person’s
knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the
circumstances, –
(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to
cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost;
(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by
existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modiﬁcation, or
reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;
(3) the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
speciﬁcally so identiﬁed, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable
opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and
(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specif-
ically so identiﬁed, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.
(c) Sanctions. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court
determines that subdivision (b) has been violated, the court may, subject to the
conditions stated below, impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law
ﬁrms,orpartiesthathaveviolatedsubdivision(b)orareresponsiblefortheviolation.
ii. The decision to prosecute
Section9-27.220.AoftheUnitedStatesJusticeDepartment’sUnitedStatesAttorneys’
Manual speciﬁes the standard that should be observed in deciding whether to
prosecute:
TheattorneyforthegovernmentshouldcommenceorrecommendFederalprosecution
if he/she believes that the person’s conduct constitutes a Federal offense and that the
admissible evidence will probably be sufﬁcient to obtain and sustain a conviction,
unless, in his/her judgment, prosecution should be declined because:
1. No substantial Federal interest would be served by prosecution;
2. The person is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or
3. There exists an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution.
The standard in England and Wales is similar. Under The Code for Crown
Prosecutors,6 there are two tests which must be satisﬁed before a prosecution is

initiated – the evidential test and the public interest test. The two are summarized
in sections 5.1 and 6.2 of the Code.
5.1 Crown Prosecutors must be satisﬁed that there is enough evidence to provide a
‘realistic prospect of conviction’ against each defendant on each charge. They must
consider what the defence case may be, and how that is likely to affect the prosecution
case.
. . .
6.2 The public interest must be considered in each case where there is enough evidence
to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. A prosecution will usually take place unless
there are public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh
those tending in favour. Although there may be public interest factors against prose-
cution in a particular case, often the prosecution should go ahead and those factors
should be put to the court for consideration when sentence is being passed.
Both sets of standards are clearly written as guides to the exercise of discretion.
The legal limits of that discretion are unclear.
iii. Other pre-trial decisions
A further aspect of lawyers’ decisions should be considered. There is frequently a
tension between the lawyer’s duties to the client (e.g., to pursue the client’s objective
zealously within the bounds of the law) and the lawyer’s duties to the court and
to opposing counsel and their clients (e.g., not to assert claims or take actions
for purposes of delay). The duty to the client is likely to push the lawyer to ignore
standardsintendedtoguidediscretion,suchasthe“goodfaithbasisinfact”standard,
and to exercise discretion in favor of the client unless satisﬁed that the exercise
violates the standard establishing legal limits in a manner that is likely to be detected
and result in sanctions or other adverse consequences.
For example, in 1969, the United States and, later, several private parties ﬁled sep-
arate civil actions alleging that International Business Machines Company (“IBM”)
had violated various provisions of the antitrust laws. A few years later, IBM’s chair-
man is reported to have quipped that IBM’s Vice President for Legal Affairs had the
only ofﬁce with an unlimited budget, and that he had already over-spent it. IBM and
its law ﬁrm are reported to have assigned more than 20 lawyers to the case and to
have instructed them that every debatable issue was to be litigated to the maximum
extent permitted by law. Pre-trial motions and discovery took six years. The trial
on liability alone lasted more than six additional years. After 12 years and a change
in the administration, the Justice Department dropped its suit, stipulating it was
“without merit.” Most of the private plaintiffs were unable to pursue their claims
successfully. In one view, decisions by IBM and its lawyers to pursue every point to
the maximum and the resulting delays ultimately controlled the outcome.7 What
standards other than costs can or should be applied to limit lawyers’ discretion in
7 See Watson and Petre (1990) 376–89 (for a description from the client’s standpoint).

making decisions in litigation? This ethical tension is apparent in many decisions
lawyers must make.
Questions
1 Does Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure establish standards intended to
guide the lawyer in her exercise of discretion or standards designed to conﬁne the
limits of that discretion? Does the rule provide a clear standard governing a judge’s
decision to impose sanctions or merely standards designed to aid the judge in the
exercise of discretion?
2 The standards established to guide prosecutors in deciding whether a prosecution
should be initiated are, by their terms, intended as guides to the exercise of discretion.
What standards should deﬁne the limits of that discretion and who should have

the judge to resolve disputes concerning the admissibility of evidence. At the close of
the evidence, counsel will attempt to persuade the fact-ﬁnder that the evidence does
or does not satisfy the prescribed standard and requires a verdict favorable to his or
her client. Generally, the loser may appeal to a higher court claiming that errors by
the trial judge or jury in applying the standards for assessing the parts or the whole
of the evidence require outright reversal or at least a new trial. In this section, we
discuss the signiﬁcance of the standards governing adjudicative decisions such as
these.
a. Standards for decisions disposing of a case as a matter of law
Prior to trial the parties to a case may ask the court to dispose of the case as a
matter of law on the ground that there are no disputed facts the resolution of which
could affect the outcome. A defendant may move to dismiss the complaint on the
ground that the facts alleged, if true, do not state a claim for which the law provides
a remedy. In a civil case, either party may move for judgment on the pleadings on
the ground that the facts alleged or admitted in the pleadings, when viewed most
favorably to the opposing party, establish as a matter of law that the relief must be
or cannot properly be granted. At any time prior to a civil trial, with the additional
evidence obtained through discovery or presented by afﬁdavit, either party may ask
the court to grant summary judgment on the ground that the then existing state of
the record establishes that no fact material to a determination of the outcome as a
matter of law is subject to any genuine dispute.
Each of these motions asserts a claim that there is no factual dispute to be

Analysis of Evidence
are admitted or have been placed beyond reasonable challenge. The standard for
decision on such motions is whether the claimant is right: If there are no material
facts in dispute, the court should ﬁnally dispose of the case by applying the correct
principle of law.8
At various stages in a trial, the judge may be asked to terminate the proceedings
and rule in favor of one of the parties. When the prosecution or the plaintiff has
ﬁnished presenting evidence and has rested, the defendant may ask the trial court
to rule that the evidence is insufﬁcient to support a conviction or a judgment for
the plaintiff. When the defendant has rested, either the defendant or, in a civil case,
the plaintiff may ask the court to rule either that the evidence is insufﬁcient or that
it points so overwhelmingly in one party’s favor that there is no reason to proceed
further.
The standard that the trial judge is to apply again requires a determination
whether any fact material to the outcome is subject to genuine dispute. A motion
attackingthesufﬁciencyoftheevidenceasksthecourttodeterminethattheevidence
is so slight that no rational trier of fact could reach a favorable conclusion to the
degree of certainty required by the applicable standard of proof. A motion asking
for a directed verdict or an early judgment on other grounds asks the court to
determine that the evidence is so weak or, in a civil case, so overwhelming that
under the applicable standard of proof rational fact-ﬁnders could not disagree on
the correct result.
In theory, an appellate court applies the same standard and need not accord any
deference or special weight to the trial judge’s decision on such claims. The appellate
court, so the theory goes, is as capable as the trial court in identifying and applying
the correct legal principle, and as capable as the trial court in determining whether
the evidence left room for rational debate as to any fact necessary to the judgment
reached.9 The important points, for present purposes, are two. Logical analysis is
a necessary condition to effective argument. It is not, however, a sufﬁcient basis
either for argument or for predicting or explaining decisions.
b. Standards for decisions on admissibility
We address the relationship between the principles of proof and the law of evidence
in Chapter 11. It should be apparent, however, that many rules of evidence are
standards intended to guide the trial judge in exercising her discretion in deciding
whether evidence should be admitted or its use limited.
One of the basic principles underlying the rules and deﬁning the extent of the
judge’s discretion under those rules is that a judge should exclude evidence whose
8 In theory, this involves no discretion, and an appellate court applies the same standard in assessing
the trial court’s decision, but cases such as Robinson v. Diamond Housing Corp., 267 A.2d 833 (D.C.
Ct. App. 1970), and Robinson v. Diamond Housing Corp., 463 F.2d 853 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (reversing
the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals) make it clear that there is an element of
discretion involved even here.
9 As the Diamond decisions in the trial court and on appeal illustrate, the extent to which appellate
practice conforms to established theory is at least open to debate.

improper prejudicial effects substantially outweigh its legitimate probative value.
Precise analysis of the inferences that a particular item of evidence might support is
necessarytoidentifybothitsimproperprejudicialeffectsanditslegitimateprobative
value.
How should a Wigmorean lawyer approach the task of identifying and arguing
the probative value and prejudicial effects that the court should consider in deciding
whether particular evidence should be admitted or excluded? The ﬁrst step in the
equation requires identiﬁcation of the inferences that are claimed to give the evi-
dencelegitimateprobativevalue.Thesecondrequiresidentiﬁcationoftheimproper
prejudicial effects that the evidence may have. The results of this analysis establish
the framework for arguments about whether the improper prejudicial effects sub-
stantially outweigh the legitimate probative value of the evidence in the context of
this case.
Establishing probative value begins with analysis. To what fact of consequence
in the litigation is the proffered evidential data relevant? The kind of analysis and
its importance in this context may be illustrated by an example drawn from United
States v. Richard Able.10 Given the parties’ respective theories, the only penultimate
probanda open to dispute were:
5 At the time the 2003 return was ﬁled, RA knew that the 2003 return was false.
8 At the time the 2003 return was ﬁled, RA intended to defraud the government of the
taxes due and owing on $45,000.
The prosecution would seek to introduce as part of its evidence the cancelled
check for $25,000 issued by the law ﬁrm to Able with endorsements showing it was
cashed at a Citibank branch in Las Vegas. Its relevance is clear. The cancelled check
shows that Able received $25,000 on December 20, 2002, and that this amount
was income. That check combined with evidence showing the salary Able received
from the law school and the two other checks combine to support an inference that
Able received $170,000 income during 2002 ($125,000 salary, $25,000 from the Law
Firm, and $20,000 from other consulting work) – one of the penultimate probanda
the government must prove. This analysis, at least provisionally, also establishes
that the probative value of the evidence is high: Absent evidence of forgery or the
like, the cancelled check would appear to establish, and to be necessary to establish,
a central fact of consequence to something approaching a certainty.
The government would also claim that the endorsement made the check relevant
to motive. On its face, the claim is plausible. The number of the steps in the chain of
inferences necessary to demonstrate that relevance makes it clear that its probative
value with respect to motive is slight (page 129).
In the face of that analysis, what bases would be open to counsel for Able to object
topermittingthejurytoseetheendorsementonthecheck?Theanalysisnecessaryto

Analysis of Evidence
respond requires an understanding of the kinds of improper prejudicial effects that
provide proper bases for arguments opposing the admission of particular evidence.
The key is identifying effects that the law identiﬁes as improper.11
A standard articulation requires the court to consider effects of the evidence
that might cause “unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury,
or . . . unduedelay,wasteoftime,orneedlesspresentationofcumulativeevidence.”12
Thatstandardrequiresﬁrstananalysisofinferencessupportedbytheevidenceother
than those that demonstrate its relevance, and then an identiﬁcation of policies or
reasons that renders the alternative inferences improperly prejudicial.
Thenatureofthetaskandsomeofthepoliciesandreasonscanbeillustratedbyan
analysis of the endorsement on the cancelled check from the standpoint of counsel
for Able. The endorsement showing that Able cashed the check on December 20 in
Las Vegas supports a number of inferences:
Able cashed a large check in Las Vegas, therefore Able was a gambler, therefore Able is
a risk taker.
The amount of the check supports an inference that Able stayed at a fancy hotel and
gambling casino, therefore Able is a high liver.
Only ﬁve days before Christmas, Able cashed a check in a city built for gamblers and
in a state which has legalized prostitution, therefore Able is not the kind of person
who respects the traditional ways of celebrating an important family and Christian
holiday.
Depending upon the views represented in the jury, any or all of these inferences
could be damaging to Able. At the same time, an inference that Able was a gambler
and a high liver, in light of his income for the year, supports a chain of inferences
pointing toward motive and hence to knowledge and intent. Are these inferences
in any way improper?
The argument that they are unfairly prejudicial stems from the policies that
underlie the rules governing character evidence. Although casino gambling may be
legal in Las Vegas, it is likely to be viewed as a character defect in states where it
is illegal (including the hypothetical New State), supporting an inference that Able
is a bad person. So too, gambling may be regarded as establishing a propensity to
take risks, and the jury might infer that Able’s propensity to take risks made it likely
that he took the risk of ﬁling a false tax return to defraud the government. These
inferences have some logical force, but they conﬂict with the policies of individuated
justice that underlie the character evidence rule. Able is not on trial for gambling
or high living, and the jury’s deliberations may be unfairly prejudiced or the issues
confused if this evidence is admitted.
This analysis has identiﬁed some prejudicial effects that are improper. The stan-
dard formulation of the rule, however, would require that Able’s counsel persuade
11 It should be clear that any evidence that supports one side of a dispute should ordinarily have an

This is misleading because, absent other factors, there is nothing improper about these effects.

the trial judge that the danger created by improper prejudicial effects substantially
outweighs the legitimate probative value of the law ﬁrm’s check, which directly
supports, and is probably the strongest evidence with respect to, an element of the
offense – the amount of income Able received in 2002.
Assume that Linda Davis had died before the trial and that Able’s counsel agreed
to stipulate to the fact that Able received $25,000 from the law ﬁrm in 2002 and,
if desired, to stipulate to the admission of a copy of the front of the check with a
further stipulation that Able cashed it in December 2002. In that case, Able’s lawyer
couldpersuasivelyarguethattheidentiﬁedimproperprejudicialeffectssubstantially
outweigh any legitimate probative value of the endorsement with respect to motive,
and the argument would have considerable force.13
The example has isolated a piece of evidence and analyzed it apart from the case
as a whole. Assume that Linda Davis had not died and was available at trial. In
that situation, it should be apparent that an assessment of the arguments about the
endorsement would depend upon Linda Davis’s testimony. If Davis, for example,
testiﬁed that Able took her to Las Vegas for a gambling spree and that the two
did gamble heavily and lost and spent most of the balance of the $25,000 enjoying
Las Vegas’s other attractions, the prosecution’s argument for admission would be
far stronger. If, on the other hand, Davis proffers testimony consistent with Able’s
report of the events to his counsel, Able’s lawyer may have a strong argument to
exclude much of Davis’s testimony as well as the endorsement.14
Three points deserve emphasis. First, an assessment of the probative value of an
item of evidence requires a precise identiﬁcation and analysis of each of the inferen-
tial steps necessary to relate it to a fact of consequence. Second, an identiﬁcation and
appraisal of the possible improper prejudicial effects ordinarily requires a similar
analysis. Third, the analysis must examine the particular evidence in the context of
the case as a whole. A Wigmorean chart demonstrates at a minimum that the bits of
evidence in a case are so interconnected that decisions with respect to a particular
item of evidence may have a signiﬁcant effect on the whole. A blown fuse is going
to affect more than the socket that caused it to blow.
So far the analysis has focused upon arguments designed to persuade the trial
judgetosustainanobjectionclaimingthattheprejudicialeffectsoftheendorsement
substantially outweighed their probative value. Even with this rather detailed analy-
sis, would a decision by the trial judge overruling either or both objections be likely
to cause an appellate court to overrule the judgment were Able convicted? If the
13 Perhaps such force that a refusal by the trial court to accept to exclude the evidence would exceed
the limits of the broad discretion conferred upon her by Rule 403. See Old Chief v. United States,
519 U.S. 172 (1997).
14 If Able’s counsel succeeds in persuading the court to exclude the endorsement from evidence
during the prosecution’s case, the question could arise again if Able took the stand. If Able were to
testify to facts supporting an argument that he was a ﬁscally and socially conservative individual,
the prosecutor would likely re-offer the endorsement on rebuttal, arguing that Able’s testimony
had opened the door and placed his character in issue and had made the credibility of his assertions
facts of consequence in the litigation and that the re-offered evidence had thus obtained a probative
value that could no longer be successfully disputed.
