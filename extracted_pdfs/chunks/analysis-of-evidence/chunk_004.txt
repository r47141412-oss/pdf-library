3 Identify each testimonial proposition that you believe would not be admissible as
evidence under the rules of evidence. State why that evidence is inadmissible and
identify the rule of evidence that supports each conclusion. Identify only those
propositions that you conclude are inadmissible. Would the exclusion of this evidence
affect the result of your analysis under question 2? For each proposition excluded,
would the exclusion promote the search for truth? If not what other policies are
served by the exclusion?
7. Whose baby II? Morrison v. Jenkins 80 C.L.R. 626 (Aust. 1949)
[Melbourne, Oct. 13, 14, 17, 18; Dec. 22. Latham C.J., Rich, Dixon, McTiernan and
Webb JJ.]
[In proceedings to obtain the custody of a child, the applicants, Mr. and Mrs. M., alleged
that there had been a confusion of identity between their child and that of Mr. and Mrs.
J. at the hospital at which the two children were born at about the same time and that
each mother had been given the child of the other. They accordingly sought an order
for custody of the child which was – and had been for some four years – in the custody
of Mr. and Mrs. J. The primary judge found that the child was in fact that of Mr. and
Mrs. M., and he ordered that they have the custody of the child.
Held, by RICH, DIXON and WEBB JJ. (LATHAM C.J. and MCTIERNAN J. dis-
senting) that the order should be set aside because, per RICH and DIXON JJ., the
evidence left the parentage of the child so much in doubt that it would not be for the
child’s welfare to remove it from its present custody: per WEBB J. (LATHAM C.J. and
MCTIERNAN J. contra), the evidence as a whole did not warrant the conclusion of the
primary judge that the child belonged to the appellants.]
Decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria (Full Court), (1949) V.L.R. 277
afﬁrmed . . .
LATHAM C.J. On 22nd June 1945 a baby girl was born to Mrs. Alberta Gwen
Morrison in the labour ward at the Kyneton Hospital in Victoria. Within the preceding
ﬁve minutes a baby girl had been born in the same ward to Mrs. Jessie Jenkins. Mrs.
Morrison and her husband claim that the baby known as Nola Jenkins, who has lived
with the Jenkins family ever since Mrs. Jenkins left the hospital, is her (Mrs. Morrison’s)
baby and that the girl known as Johanne Lee Morrison who was given to Mrs. Morrison
at the hospital as her baby is not in fact her child. Mr. and Mrs. Morrison took pro-
ceedings against Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins by way of habeas corpus, claiming the custody
of Nola . . .
The case for Mr. and Mrs. Morrison was supported by their own afﬁdavits and by
afﬁdavitsofMrs.AmeliaWilliams(Mrs.Morrison’smother),Dr.DouglasJohnThomas
andDr.LucyMeredithBryce–clinicalpathologistshighlyskilledinthemakingofblood
tests, which is a very specialized form of medical practice. Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins made
afﬁdavits in reply, as also did Sister Lockhart and Sister Cass of the Kyneton Hospital.
These two nurses attended upon the occasion of the conﬁnement of the two ladies,
Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins. The parties, the nurses and Dr. Lucy Bryce were cross-
examined upon their afﬁdavits. An afﬁdavit by Dr. Gerald Loughran, who delivered

Analysis of Evidence
both children, was also ﬁled on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins. Dr. Loughran at the
time of the trial was absent in Singapore and was not available for cross-examination.
The learned trial judge examined the evidence in detail and approached the question
of the parentage of Nola by asking four questions, which were as follows: – “1. Was the
female child to which Mrs. Morrison gave birth on June 22, 1945, in the labour ward of
the Kyneton District Hospital the offspring of the union between her and her husband
William Henry Morrison? 2. Was the female child that was brought to Mrs. Morrison
before she left the labour ward the female child to which she had given birth about
half an hour earlier? 3. If the female child so brought to her was not the child to which
she had given birth, was there an opportunity for a mistake to be made by which some
other female child could have been substituted for the child to which she had given
birth? 4. If there was such an opportunity, what other child could have been mistakenly
substituted for the child to which Mrs. Morrison had given birth?”
The answers which his Honour gave to these questions were as follows: 1. Yes;
2. No; 3. Yes; 4. Johanne Lee. Bearing in mind the gravity of the issues before the Court,
his Honour was thoroughly convinced that Nola was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Morrison and, after considering what course of action would be for the welfare of Nola,
he made an order that Nola should be delivered up to Mr. and Mrs. Morrison, and that
they should have custody of her.
As to some matters there is no room for doubt. In the ﬁrst place, it is established
beyond question that a female child was born to Mrs. Morrison in the Kyneton Hospital
on 22nd June 1945.
In the second place, I regard it as also completely established that that child (whoever
she was) was the issue of Mr. and Mrs. Morrison. Mrs. Morrison gave evidence that she
had never had sexual intercourse with any person other than her husband. She was not
cross-examined upon this matter. The learned trial judge believed her evidence. There
is in my opinion no ground whatever for suggesting at this stage in the proceedings
that Mrs. Morrison had been unchaste and that the child which was born to her was
not the child of her husband.
The three separate sets of blood tests applied to Mr. and Mrs. Morrison and Johanne
Lee show, according to the uncontradicted scientiﬁc evidence, that the child Johanne
Lee, although she might be the child of Mrs. Morrison, cannot possibly be the child of
Mr. and Mrs. Morrison. This proposition has not been challenged at any step of the
case. The scientiﬁc evidence on this point is conclusive . . .
Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins submitted an afﬁdavit by Dr. Loughran (who could not be
cross-examined) to the effect that he made blood tests of them and of Nola and that
according to his recollection the tests showed that Nola could be their child. They
declined to have any further tests made by the highly-qualiﬁed experts who were avail-
able. No evidence was given by any witness to the effect that Dr. Loughran’s evidence,
even if completely accepted, showed or even tended to show that Nola actually was
the child of Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins or that she could not be the child of Mr. and Mrs.
Morrison. It is established that Johanne Lee is the child which was brought to Mrs.
Morrison within not more than half an hour of the birth of her child and is the child
which has been in her custody ever since. It is therefore clear that a mistake was made
in the hospital and that Mrs. Morrison was given the wrong baby . . .

Sisters Cass and Lockhart gave evidence to the effect that before the two babies were
born to Mrs. Jenkins and Mrs. Morrison either two cots containing clothes marked with
the names of the mothers or one cot containing such garments was in the labour ward.
The learned trial judge rejected this and other evidence of the nurses and accepted the
evidence of Mrs. Morrison. He also accepted the evidence of Mrs. Morrison that the
two babies were taken out of the labour ward at the same time in the arms of Sister
Atkinson. I cannot see how a court of appeal could justify a reversal of the decision
of the learned judge with reference to evidence of this character by believing evidence
which the learned judge had rejected by reason of his opinion of the credibility of the
witnesses. But, in any case, the evidence as to whether there were two cots or only one
cot in the ward and where any cot was in the ward and as to whether Sister Atkinson
took the babies out in her arms or otherwise is on the margin of the case.
The ﬁndings of the learned trial judge as to the credibility of the evidence of the
various witnesses were hardly challenged. Upon appeal, though not at the trial, consid-
erable attention was directed to evidence given by Mrs. Williams, the mother of Mrs.
Morrison, that on the day when the children were born she was shown a baby by Sister
Lockhart as being Mrs. Morrison’s child and that that child had a fair complexion.
Johanne Lee has a dark complexion. This evidence appears to me to be unimportant.
Whether the evidence of Mrs. Williams is accepted or not, it leaves untouched the
certain conclusion that Johanne Lee is not Mrs. Morrison’s baby. Sister Lockhart may
have shown Mrs. Williams the right baby, but even if the conclusion arose at a later time
than that found by the learned trial judge, it still leaves for determination the problem
of the identiﬁcation of Mrs. Morrison’s child . . .
Johanne Lee was substituted for the baby born to Mrs. Morrison. The question for
determination is whether Nola was Mrs. Morrison’s baby for whom Johanne Lee was
substituted. The circumstances of the two births, which were practically simultaneous,
the fact that Sister Atkinson had no midwifery experience as to tagging babies with
some identifying label, that the two babies were taken out of the ward together by Sister
Atkinson to be bathed by Sister Lockhart, wrapped up in some wrapper provided by
the hospital, though possibly also with bunny rugs round them, that there was only one
bath in which to bathe them, that the baby which was brought to Mrs. Morrison half an
hour after birth as her baby was unclothed, wearing no identifying garments, that the
learned trial judge did not accept the evidence of the nurses that there were cots in the
ward tagged with the names Morrison and Jenkins, that there was every opportunity
for confusion between the Morrison and Jenkins babies, and the most important fact
that Johanne Lee is not the child of Mr. and Mrs. Morrison, so that Mrs. Morrison got
the wrong baby, all go to support the conclusion that the Jenkins baby was by mistake
given to Mrs. Morrison.
But it was argued that two other female children were born in the hospital at about
the same time, namely to Mrs. Hayes on 19th June and to Mrs. Perry on 20th June, and
thatoneofthesebabiesmighthavebeensubstitutedforthebabyborntoMrs.Morrison.
Mrs. Morrison’s baby was born on 22nd June. Sister Lockhart gave evidence that she did
not think it was possible to mix up a newly-born baby with a baby who was even only
twenty-four hours old. This evidence was apparently accepted at the trial by all parties
as obviously true. No cross-examination was directed against it. The Hayes baby was

Analysis of Evidence
about three days and the Perry baby about two days older than Mrs. Morrison’s child.
No evidence was given to support the speculation that Mrs. Morrison’s baby was given
to Mrs. Hayes or Mrs. Perry or that she was given one of their babies. In my opinion
there was ample evidence to support the ﬁnding of the learned trial judge that Nola is
the child of Mrs. Morrison . . .
RICH J. . . . Moreover, there is real doubt whether Nola is the child of the Morrisons
and this is another factor to be taken into consideration in determining the issue of
welfare. I am not satisﬁed that the scientiﬁc evidence is infallible. At most it goes to
show that Johanne Lee is not the child of the Morrison union. But it neither shows nor
purports to show that Nola Jenkins is the child of that union although it does show that
Johanne Lee could be the child of Mrs. Morrison. On this issue the appellants must
exclude every other reasonable hypothesis. Did a mistake in fact occur? The evidence
of Mrs. Williams is inconsistent with that of her daughter, the female appellant, and
is also inconsistent with the ﬁnding of the learned primary judge that the exchange of
babies occurred shortly after birth. Moreover at the time of the alleged mistake two
other recently born babies – the Perry and Hayes children – were born on the 19th and
20th June in the same nursery in the same hospital. The appellants had no evidence as to
these children or their mothers or that either mother had ever seen her child before the
morning of 22nd June. In these circumstances the possibility of a mistake with either of
these children cannot be excluded. Thus the probability of a mistake with the Jenkins’
child to the exclusion of any other is considerably lessened, if, indeed, a mistake did
in fact occur. A decision as to parentage will not bind the child and at a later stage in
other proceedings – for example under a will or settlement in which the child should
be a party [to] a decision contrary to that in the instant case would be a grievous blow
to the happiness and welfare of the child. Indeed in a proceeding to which the child is
not a party the Court has no jurisdiction to decide a question of legitimacy . . .
DIXON J. . . . The inference that Nola is the child of the Morrisons rests of course
wholly on circumstantial evidence. Notwithstanding the wealth of detail gone into,
particularly as to the circumstances of the birth of the two children, the whole case
depends upon a chain consisting of a very few evidentiary facts or circumstances and
some steps in reasoning which together are relied upon as warranting the inference.
The ﬁrst of these facts or steps is the conclusion deposed to by scientiﬁc witnesses that
Johanne Lee belongs to a blood group that is inconsistent with her being the child of
Mr. Morrison. This conclusion the Jenkins are powerless to deny. The second step is
the inference that she is therefore not the child of Mrs. Morrison. Any other inference
would reﬂect upon Mrs. Morrison and the Jenkins make no such reﬂection. The third
is the fact that from the time that Mrs. Morrison left the hospital with a girl child and
until the scientists took the blood tests there has been no change in the identity of that
child and she is Johanne Lee and was the child submitted to the blood tests. This fact
is proved by the Morrisons. Nothing of course could be more probable and it may be
accepted as possessing as much certainty as attaches to the proof of any fact in human
affairs. But as it is an essential step in the reasoning it must not be omitted. The fourth
step is proof that at the hospital where both women were conﬁned there was a real
chance of confusion between the female child which Mrs. Morrison bore and some

35
other female child. The ﬁfth step is the elimination of the possibility that any other
child but Mrs. Jenkins’ could have been attributed to Mrs. Morrison. The sixth step is
the inference that correspondingly Mrs. Jenkins must have received Mrs. Morrison’s
child.
By this chain of reasoning the result that Nola is Mrs. Morrison’s child is said to
be established. To make good the last three steps a great deal of evidence was adduced
at the hearing. The events of the morning of 22nd June 1945 when both women were
delivered of female children within ten or ﬁfteen minutes in the same labour ward were
inquired into in great detail. I should have thought that neither nurses nor patients
could be expected to observe or recall so much and that their attempts to reconstruct
the incidents of the morning could not safely be relied upon. But two conclusions
emerge which are clear enough. One is that there was no routine for identifying babies
which excluded the possibility of mistake and the other is that because two women were
delivered by the same doctor and nursing staff in the same ward within such a short
time there was a greater liability to confusion.
But in my opinion the further inference or conclusions which have been drawn as to
the precise manner in which the babies were handled and exactly by whom are doubtful
and in some respects speculative and they are unsafe.
Two other recently born female children were in the hospital, one born on 20th and
the other on 19th of June. It does not appear whether they were full-term children nor
was the condition of the mothers or any other circumstances proved really relevant
to the possibility or impossibility, likelihood or unlikelihood, of the confusion (if one
took place) being with either of those children. The case for the Morrisons naturally
was that their child was confused with the Jenkins’ child immediately after the birth
of the children. That was the view which Barry J. adopted and acted upon. But Mrs.
Morrison’s mother, who visited the hospital later on the same day, in the afternoon,
said that she was shown a child as her daughter’s which was not the child her daughter
brought home from the hospital. The tendency of her evidence if it were correct was
to show a confusion at some later time and not as a result of the birth of two children
at nearly the same time in the same ward. There would therefore be little or no reason
to suppose that the confusion was with Mrs. Jenkins’ child rather than with one of the
other two girl babies.
The only further fact I shall mention is that little or nothing is known concerning the
blood grouping of the Jenkins and Nola. They submitted themselves to their medical
adviser for a blood test and he reported that it disclosed that Nola might be their child,
that is that their blood grouping was consistent with their being the parents of Nola.
He made an afﬁdavit to that effect but he was abroad and not available for cross-
examination. The Jenkins declined to submit themselves and the child to further blood
tests . . .
With any chain of circumstantial evidence the chances of error in the conclusion
arise ﬁrst from the chances of error in each fact or consideration forming the steps
and second from the chance of error in reasoning to the conclusion from the whole of
those facts and considerations. It is therefore wrong to take each fact or consideration
separately, to assess the possibilities of error in ﬁnding it is established and then if you

Analysis of Evidence
think it should be found afterwards to treat it as a certainty and pass to the next fact or
consideration and so on to the conclusion. The possibilities of error at all points must
be combined and assessed together.
In the present case I think that when all the possibilities are taken into account
there is too much uncertainty in the inference that Nola is the child of Mr. and Mrs.
Morrison to warrant an order taking her from Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins and placing her in
the custody of Mr. and Mrs. Morrison. It was a sound exercise of the discretion of the
Supreme Court to leave her in the custody of Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins . . .
McTIERNAN J. . . . The evidence proves that the child born to Mrs. Morrison on
22nd June 1945 in the labour ward of the Kyneton District Hospital was begotten by
her husband. This fact is an irresistible inference from the evidence, given by Mrs.
Morrison, that she never had sexual intercourse with any man other than her husband.
Barry J. believed this evidence. There is no ground upon which an appeal court could
properly decide that his Honour erred in believing this evidence or why the Court itself
should disbelieve it or suspect that the child born to Mrs. Morrison was not begotten by
her husband. The scientiﬁc evidence of the blood tests, the validity and the reliability of
whichareestablishedbytheevidence,provesthatJohanneLee,achildunderthecustody
of the appellants, could be the child of Mrs. Morrison but not of her and her husband.
TheevidencefurtherprovesthatJohanneLeeisthebabywhowasgiventoMrs.Morrison
after she had given birth to a child at the above-mentioned time and place, upon the
supposition that it was the child to which she had given birth; she was the child whom
Mrs. Morrison took with her from the hospital when she returned to her home.
These facts establish beyond any reasonable doubt that Mrs. Morrison was given a
baby to which she did not give birth and the baby is Johanne Lee.
The next crucial question is when was the mistake made at the hospital which led to
the substitution of Johanne Lee for the baby to which Mrs. Morrison gave birth. The
answer to this question is that the mistake was made within half an hour of the birth
of Mrs. Morrison’s own child. This fact is proved by the following evidence elicited by
the cross-examination of Mrs. Morrison: – Q. “May we take it that that was the baby
that was brought back to you within half an hour at the outside of its birth and that
you took away with you when you ultimately left the hospital? – Yes.” Q. “So that, if any
mistake was made, in the transposition of these babies, it was prior to that time? – Yes.”
Barry J. accepted this evidence. It proved that the result of the mistake was complete
before the afternoon of 22nd June. Mrs. Morrison’s baby was then in the possession of
some other woman.
In the light of this fact, Mrs. Williams’ evidence, to which importance was attached
in the Full Court, can have but small signiﬁcance. It probably provides the reason why
Barry J. paid no attention to Mrs. Williams’ evidence (a fact noticed in the Full Court);
she was not cross-examined. Mrs. Williams is Mrs. Morrison’s mother; her evidence is
in an afﬁdavit ﬁled in support of the appellant’s application.
To whom was the baby born to Mrs. Morrison given?
The evidence proves that the parturitions of Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins
occurred at the same time and place and their babies were born within ﬁve to ten
minutes of each other: their simultaneous parturitions created an emergency described
in the evidence, arrangements had to be made quickly to cope with it.

The evidence further proves that in this hospital a female baby was born on 19th June
1945; and another female baby was born on 20th June 1945.
Assuming that each of these babies was born at the latest point of time to make
those dates respectively their birthdays, then on the morning of 22nd June, when
Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins gave birth to their babies, the ﬁrst of the two other
babies would then be ﬁfty-ﬁve hours old, and the second thirty-one hours old. If either
was born at an earlier hour she would of course be older.
It is reasonably certain that before the morning of 22nd June these older babies
would have been placed under the usual routine of a baby’s life. They would have been
more than once bathed, dressed, fed, and have been in the possession of their mother.
It is hardly probable that either would at that stage of her life have been placed with a
woman not her mother.
Sister Lockhart, a double-certiﬁcated nurse, said in the course of her evidence that
she did not think it was possible to mix up a newly-born baby with a baby forty-eight
hours old.
It is less probable that confusion could have taken place between Mrs. Morrison’s
baby and one of the older babies, than between her baby and Mrs. Jenkins’ baby. The
births of their babies were almost contemporaneous.
Barry J. found that a nurse carried them out, one on each arm, from the labour ward
to the nursery to be bathed, and they were left unattended until Sister Lockhart bathed
them.
The ﬁeld within which the mistake could occur, upon any reasonable view, must be
limitedtothetwomothersandthetwobabieswhowerealltogetherinthecomparatively
small labour ward, receiving the attention of the doctor and nurses: these two mothers
and babies were involved in the same set of circumstances . . .
There is no evidence which could raise a doubt that the members of the hospital
staff did give each of the babies born on 19th June and 20th June respectively to her
mother. It is not a probable hypothesis that Mrs. Morrison’s baby was exchanged for
one of those babies, upon a reasonable view of the circumstances . . .
Mrs. Morrison said that the child brought to her within half an hour of the birth
was dark and unclad and was the child she took home with her. Mrs. Williams said the
baby shown to her on that afternoon and which a member of the nursing staff told her
was her daughter’s baby was a fairskinned baby and resembled Mrs. Morrison’s other
children. This incident might possess signiﬁcance only if Mrs. Morrison was present.
She was not present . . .
WEBB J. . . . If there had been only two infants in the Kyneton District Hospital on
22nd June, 1945, namely those born on that day, this Court would, I think, be obliged
to restore the judgment of Barry J. and give the custody of Nola to the Morrisons as
their child. The onus of proof was on the Morrisons, but the credibility of witnesses was
for the learned judge to determine. His Honour believed Mrs. Morrison when she said
that the child born to her on 22nd June, 1945, was by her husband, and he naturally
acceptedtheevidenceofthebloodteststhatJohannewasnotachildbyMr.Morrison.So
he could properly have concluded that Nola was the child of the Morrisons, if there were
only the two infants in the hospital on 22nd June, 1945. The same result would follow
if it had been common ground that Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins each received a

Analysis of Evidence
newly-born baby on the morning of 22nd June, 1945. Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins
each claim to have received a newly-born infant that day. Mrs. Morrison contends
that Mrs. Jenkins did receive a newly-born baby, because Mrs. Morrison is claiming
Nola from Mrs. Jenkins. But the case for Mrs. Jenkins is that if Mrs. Morrison did not
get her own baby, she got one of the older babies born on 19th and 20th June, 1945,
and not the baby of Mrs. Jenkins. The conduct of the proceedings and the judgment
indicate that there was no common ground that Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins each
received a newly-born baby. Sister Lockhart, who made an afﬁdavit on behalf of Mr.
and Mrs. Jenkins, was cross-examined with a view to showing that Mrs. Morrison’s
child was not given to one of the mothers of the two older infants born on 19th and
20th June, 1945, and the judgment gives ground for holding why Mrs. Morrison’s child
was not given to one of these two mothers, namely, an assumption by his Honour as
to the ability of mothers generally to recognize their infants, and the evidence of Sister
Lockhart as to the impossibility in ordinary circumstances of mixing up a newly-born
baby with one twenty-four hours old.
Part of the cross-examination of Sister Lockhart was as follows: – “Is there much
difference between a newly-born baby and a baby twenty-four hours old from the point
of view of telling the difference to a nurse or a mother? . . . Sometimes there is. Are they
any more likely, and better developed, any different characteristics? . . . Oh! the features
settle a bit sometimes. Would you think it possible to mix up a newly-born baby with
a baby twenty-four hours old? . . . I don’t think so.”
These questions suggest the possibility that the infant born on 20th June was born
about midnight of that date. Of course the baby born on 20th June was at least thirty-
one hours older than the babies born about 7 a.m. on 22nd June; but the older the baby
is the less likely is it to be mistaken for a newly-born baby.
His Honour in his judgment under the heading “What other child could have been
substituted for Mrs. Morrison’s?” says: – “It appears that between the 19th June 1945
and 22nd June 1945, four female children were born at the Kyneton District Hospital.
A female child was born on the 19th, another on the 20th and the two children, the
circumstances of whose births have been examined, on the 22nd. It was submitted by
Mr. Hudson that the evidence did not exclude the possibility that some baby other than
Mrs. Jenkins’ child may have been mistakenly exchanged for Mrs. Morrison’s baby. I do
not think there is any substance in this submission. It appears to me most unlikely that
a mother of a child born on the 19th or 20th would fail to detect a mistake if a child
born on the 22nd were brought to her. Moreover, Sister Lockhart was asked: ’Would
you think it possible to mix up a newly-born baby with a baby twenty-four hours old?’
and she answered, ‘I don’t think so.’ If this be excluded as a possibility the ﬁndings of
fact I have set forth earlier leave open only one conclusion, and it is that the only baby
that could have been exchanged for Mrs. Morrison’s baby was the baby born to Mrs.
Jenkins.”
Neither the cross-examination of Sister Lockhart nor the judgment of Barry J. deal
with the actual condition of the two mothers of the older infants or the appearance of
those infants. It is conﬁned to mothers and infants generally. There was no evidence to
show the actual condition of these two mothers on 22nd June. Neither may have been
in a condition to receive or to recognize her infant. Further there was no evidence that

39
neither of the two older infants could have been mistaken on 22nd June for a newly-
born infant. Either or both could have been prematurely born. There was no evidence
to the contrary. It is not a matter of common knowledge that under no circumstances
could a baby two or three days old be mistaken for a newly-born infant. Sister Lockhart
said twice that sometimes there is a noticeable difference before saying she did not
think it possible to mix up a newly-born baby with a baby twenty-four hours old; that
is, of course, if both mothers and both infants are normal at the time of the exchange,
in which event no evidence is really necessary to show a mistake would not be likely
to occur. I do not think that any presumption arose that the other two mothers and
infants were normal, or that the Morrisons had given enough evidence, as a result of
getting these obvious answers from Sister Lockhart, to shift the onus of proof to Mr.
and Mrs. Jenkins that one of the two other mothers or one of the two older infants was
not normal in condition or appearance on 22nd June, 1945. The onus of proof is not
shifted by a mere statement of what is common knowledge. Although Mrs. Morrison
had ether administered to her at the birth of her child on 22nd June she appears to have
been in a normal condition when she received Johanne; but if Johanne was prematurely
born on 20th June, or even on the 19th, she might have appeared newly-born on 22nd
June . . .
Questions
1 Frame the ultimate proposition that the Morrisons would have had to have proven in
order to satisfy the judges of the High Court. From the portions of their opinions
included here, was each judge assessing the evidence and inferences against the same
ultimate probandum? If not, how many different versions of the ultimate probandum
were used? Was each judge applying the same standard of review?
2 In all, ten afﬁdavits were submitted and seven witnesses were cross-examined on their
afﬁdavits. Which direct assertions by afﬁdavit or on cross-examination were disputed
or contradicted at trial? Which were undisputed and uncontradicted?
3 All judges (or all but one) agree that “It was a baby other than the baby known as
Johanne Lee Morrison that was the baby borne by Mrs. Morrison.” This is an
inference critical to the case. What evidential data (here assertions by afﬁdavit or by
testimony) are relevant to this inference? Do these data directly support this inference,
or are there intermediate inferences that must be made? How do the data and any
intermediate inferences combine to support this inference? The judges agreed upon
the conclusion that the evidence supported this inference, but is the reasoning by
which each reached that conclusion the same?
4 Latham, C.J., and McTiernan, J., thought the evidence provided by Mrs. Williams
“unimportant.” Rich and Dixon, J.J., attached considerable signiﬁcance to it. What is
the inference that Mrs. Williams’s assertions can be argued to have established that is
relevant to the case? How does that inference undermine the argument that the
evidence proved that “It was Nola who was the baby born to Mrs. Morrison”?
5 In light of the evidence, how conﬁdent are you that Nola was the natural child of
Mr. and Mrs. Morrison? If we today had conclusive blood tests on all four children

and their parents analyzed by the leading experts in the ﬁeld, how much would you
bet that their conclusion would be that Nola was the Morrisons’ child? What odds
would you give or ask on a $100 bet?

the majority applied in Morrison v. Jenkins? (b) What is the standard of review the
High Court applied? (c) What is the standard of proof that an Australian trial judge
should apply in a similar paternity/custody case in the future? How do (a), (b), and
(c) differ?

Which is more rational?
8. An investigation: basic concepts in analysis and evaluation
You are a police cadet in Jonesville on your very ﬁrst assignment. A report of what
sounds like a murder has just been received. A team has been sent out to investigate.
Youhavebeeninstructedtoreceiveandorganizeallinformationpotentiallyrelevant
to the investigation as it comes in from various sources. From time to time you will
beaskedtomakeprovisionalevaluationsofthedata.Youwillalsobeaskedtoanswer
some “academic” questions as part of your training.
A
It is reported that:
1 Y was murdered in his home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1st.
2 W1 says that she saw a person with characteristics, a, b, c, and d enter Y’s home at
4:15 p.m. on January 1st.
3 X has characteristics a, b, c, and d.
Assuming that each of these propositions is true, answer the following questions:
a
Do you suspect that, “It was X who murdered Y” (probandum A, hereinafter “Pa”)?
b
Are propositions 2 and 3 relevant to Pa?
c
Do propositions 2 and 3 prove Pa to be true on the balance of probabilities?
d
Can you infer from W1’s statement that X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.?
Give reasons for your answers.
B
Deduction. Using not more than 12 further evidential propositions (such as, W2
says that he saw X strike Y at 4:20 p.m.) in each instance:
i Construct an argument proving that it was necessarily the case that “It was X who
murdered Y.”

Evidence and inference: some food for thought
41
ii Construct an argument proving that it was necessarily the case that “It was not X who
murdered Y.”
C
You now have the following additional data:
4 W2 says that he saw X, who was known to him, running out of Y’s home at 4:45 p.m.
on January 1st.
5 W2 says that X was in a state of great agitation.
6 W3 says that he overheard X on Christmas Day say angrily to Y: “I shall not forget this.”
7 A forensic laboratory report states that hairs found on a chair in the room in which
Y’s body was found are almost certainly X’s.
On the basis of propositions 1 to 7, indicate which of the following most closely
approximates your current state of belief (select one):
a
It is possible that X murdered Y.
b
It is more likely than not that X murdered Y.
c
The odds are 3 to 1 that X murdered Y.
d
It is established beyond reasonable doubt that X murdered Y.
e
I do not have any belief about Pa.
Give reasons for your answer.
D
You now have the following additional data. What difference does each proposition
make to the judgment you made in (C)? Consider each item ﬁrst on its own and
then in combination with each and then all of the other items:
8 W3, who is X’s brother, says that he saw X enter Y’s home about 4:05 p.m. on
January 1st.
9 W4 says that he was observing Y’s home between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. on January 1st
and that a person who had characteristics a, b, and d was the only person he saw
enter and the only person he saw leave during this period.
10 There is no record that X has ever committed a crime of violence.
11 X has two convictions for shoplifting; the most recent occurred ﬁve years ago.
Indicate the current state of your belief after considering each of these propo-
sitions in connection with propositions 1 to 7. State brieﬂy how each of the new
items of information and all of them combined affect your belief.

E
Further data. What difference does it make to your state of belief about Pa based on
propositions 1 to 11 if one of the following items of information is added to your
data? Consider each separately and in combination with the others.
12 X claims to have been in a house ﬁve miles from the scene of the murder between
2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on January 1st.
13 Z states that she was with X in a house ﬁve miles from the murder between 4 p.m. and
4:24 p.m. on January 1st.
14 A new pathologist’s report suggests that Y might have died at any time between 2 p.m.
and 6 p.m. on January 1st.
15 The same report suggests that the cause of death was probably a blow with a blunt
instrument, but could have been from natural causes (such as from striking his head
on a table as he fell), but this seems unlikely. No blunt instrument has been found on
the premises.
Give reasons for your answers.
F
Ancillary evidence (evidence about evidence). What difference does it make to your
state of belief about Pa based on propositions 1 to 15 if one of the following items
of information is added to your data? Consider each separately and in combination
with the others.
16 W1 is a bank manager?
17 W2 is very short-sighted?
18 W2 is Y’s brother and stands to beneﬁt ﬁnancially from Y’s death?
19 W1 seemed to be very nervous and hesitant when questioned by the police?
20 W3 is a licensed private investigator?
21 Z is a prostitute?
a In what respect or respects is the information about W1, W2, W3, W4, and Z relevant
to an assessment of that witness’s credibility? Be speciﬁc.
b Is any of these witnesses likely to be biased?
c How is the new information relevant to your assessment of the likelihood of Pa?
Give reasons for your answers.
G
Revise your judgment about Pa in the light of the following background information;
in each case consider the item separately and then jointly with all the other items
in this section.

22 X is female.
23 X is a 65-year-old volunteer social worker.
24 Y was X’s son.
25 Y’s “home” was an apartment in a building with 20 apartments.
26 Y’s home was in an apartment building with three separate entrances.
27 At an identiﬁcation parade (line-up) held three days after the murder, W1 failed to
identify X.
Give reasons for the effect each proposition and all propositions together have on
your judgment.
H
General propositions. In arguments about evidence, several different kinds of general
propositions play an important role both as discrete steps in an argument and as
background knowledge. At this stage it is useful to make elementary distinctions
between scientiﬁc truths (such as the law of gravity, that eyewitness identiﬁcation
evidence is often unreliable), common sense generalizations (such as that running
away is indicative of a sense of guilt), commonly held beliefs (such as national or
ethnic stereotypes, including prejudices, that suggest that a person of such origins
has certain characteristics), and general background information bearing on the
present case (case speciﬁc generalizations, such as a generalization about X’s habits
or Y’s character).
28 A recent report of empirical research on eyewitness evidence suggests that eyewitness
statements reporting identifying characteristics of a suspect made in circumstances
approximating those under which W1 observed a person entering Y’s home
(proposition 2) are only 100 percent correct in 5 percent of the cases.
29 A recent scientiﬁc report suggests that properly conducted laboratory matching of
traces of human hair in conditions approximating those upon which the conclusions
reﬂected in proposition 7 were based are correct in over 95 percent of cases.
30 X regularly had afternoon tea with Y on Sundays.
31 Few parents murder their children.
32 Features a, b, c, d were as follows: (a) white hair; (b) approximate height of ﬁve feet;
(c) a pronounced limp; (d) the wearing of a cheap brown coat.
State all the generalizations that you think may be helpful in interpreting the signif-
icance of these propositions. Classify each generalization.
I
Construct a list of ten propositions relevant to Pa. Can you think of a more efﬁcient
way of marshaling the data? If so, describe it.

Analysis of Evidence
J
You are the ofﬁcer who has just been appointed to be in charge of the investigation.
Review the information gathered so far:
a
Is there any missing evidence?
b
Is there an absence of important evidence about Y and how she met her death?
c
Is there any direct evidence of the identity of the murderer, if this was murder?
d
What direct or circumstantial evidence is there relating to X’s opportunity to kill Y?
e
Imagine three possible scenarios that might explain Y’s death. Use these to identify
good questions to ask at the next stage in this investigation.
f
Construct a plausible story incorporating all the data in propositions 1 to 30 that
indicates that it was almost certainly X who was the killer. Now construct an
alternative, rival, story that indicates that it was almost certainly W3, and not X, who
was the killer.
g
Can you eliminate any of the witnesses as suspects at this stage?
K
Other standpoints.
a
You are X’s attorney about to interview her for the ﬁrst time about this event. What
information do you hope to obtain from her? Why?
b
You are the prosecuting attorney. You have to decide whether to arrest and charge
anyone in connection with the murder on the basis of the information contained in
propositions 1 to 32. Is it sufﬁcient for this purpose? If not, how far short is it of being
sufﬁcient?

(b) “The law of evidence is a conceptual mineﬁeld.” Most writers are agreed that
it is important to distinguish clearly between “materiality,” “relevance,” “admissi-
bility,” and “weight” (or “probative force”); but there is no agreed terminology and
some issues of substance are hidden in some of the debates about words.
One widely-held view might be restated in simpliﬁed form as follows: “materiality”
concerns what has to be proved for the proponent to succeed (the facts in issue) and is
governed by substantive law; “relevance” denotes a direct or indirect probative relation
between an evidentiary fact and a factum probandum (”tends to support” or “tends

to negate”) and is a matter of logic; “probative force” denotes the strength of such
support or negation; it is based on “experience,” but there are few settled criteria for
evaluation; questions of “admissibility” concern the exclusion of otherwise relevant
evidence and are governed by the law of evidence (including the principles governing
judicial discretions to exclude). (Twining (1985) 153.)
This quotation purports to restate “one widely-held view” about the distinctions
between materiality, relevance, weight, and admissibility. What are the main points
at which this view might be challenged? To what extent do you accept this view?

Fact investigation and the nature
of evidence
“Have you ever given any attention to the Science of Evidence?” said Mr. Grodman.
“How do you mean?” asked the Home Secretary, rather puzzled, but with a melancholy
smile. “I should hardly speak of it as a science; I look at it as a question of common
sense.”
“Pardon me, sir. It is the most subtle and difﬁcult of all the sciences. It is indeed
rather the science of the sciences. What is the whole of inductive logic, as laid down
(say) by Bacon and Mill, but an attempt to appraise the value of evidence, the said
evidence being the trails left by the Creator, so to speak? The Creator has (I say it in all
reverence) drawn a myriad red herrings across the track. But the true scientist refuses
to be bafﬂed by superﬁcial appearances in detecting the secrets of Nature.”1
A. Introduction: connecting the dots
Everyone draws inferences from evidence. The dog barks, you infer that someone
is approaching the house; a loud horn sounds behind me, I infer that the driver
is impatient or angry; there is a peculiar smell in the playroom after last night’s
teenage party; cigarettes? Hash? Or just leftover pizza? There is a fresh scratch on
the front fender of my car with traces of red paint; Aunt Edna has just roared off
in her new red Ferrari. There are dark clouds overhead, footprints in the sand,
lipstick on the shirt, ﬁngerprints on the steering wheel of a stolen car. All tell tales.
Inferential reasoning is a basic human skill.
All disciplines, from archeology to zoology, from history to astronomy, from
statistics to decision theory, have largely shared problems of evidence and inference
(Twining and Hampsher-Monk, 2003). As Bentham said: “The ﬁeld of evidence
is no other than the ﬁeld of knowledge” (Bentham 1810:1). Practicing lawyers,
policemen, and judges as well as accountants, aeronautical engineers, auditors,
intelligence analysts, and anyone involved in diagnosing damaged or faulty motor
