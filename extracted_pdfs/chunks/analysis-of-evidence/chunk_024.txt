Analysis of Evidence
Even if the other person was the aggressor and the Defendant was justiﬁed in
using force in self-defense, he would not be entitled to use any greater force than he
had reasonable grounds to believe and actually did believe to be necessary under the
circumstances to save his life or avert serious bodily harm. In determining whether
the Defendant used excessive force in defending himself, you may consider all the
circumstances under which he acted. The claim of self-defense is not necessarily
defeated if greater force than would have seemed necessary in cold blood was used
by the Defendant in the heat of passion generated by an assault upon him. A
belief which may be unreasonable in cold blood may be actually and reasonably
entertained in the heat of passion.
In this case, the Defendant has also relied in part upon the defense of accident.
If evidence of accident is present, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the discharge of the Defendant’s gun was not accidental. If you believe
that the Defendant, while engaged in the commission of a lawful act and while using
due caution and circumspection, accidentally discharged the gun which caused the
death of Terry Dobbs, or if you have a reasonable doubt thereof, then you should
ﬁnd the Defendant “not guilty” on all counts of the indictment.
Any verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror. In order to
return a verdict, it is necessary that each juror agree thereto. In other words, your
verdict must be unanimous. It is your duty as jurors to consult with one another,
and to deliberate in an effort to reach agreement if you can do so without violence
to individual judgment. Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but only after
an impartial consideration of the evidence in the case with your fellow jurors. In
the course of your deliberations, do not hesitate to re-examine your own view and
change your opinion if convinced it is erroneous. But do not surrender your honest
conviction as to the weight or effect of the evidence solely because of the opinion
of your fellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.

Dale Warren, Jr., and in support of such Contest would respectfully show to this
Honorable Court and jury the following:
1 This Contest is brought as an ancillary proceeding to the Application for Probate of a
purported holographic Will of James Dale Warren, Deceased, dated October 31, last
year, ﬁled by the Decedent’s son, James Dale Warren, Jr., in Cause No. 10-05-XX,
pending, on November 4, last year.
2 By order of the Court, it has been adjudged and decreed that the purported Will dated
October 31, last year, bears the signature of James Dale Warren, Deceased, and satisﬁes
the formalities of the laws of the State of Nocona for the making of a legally binding
holographic will. By further Order of the Court, it has been adjudged and decreed
that the parties to this proceeding, Susan Warren Gearhart, Contestant, and James
Dale Warren, Jr., Proponent, are the sole legal heirs of James Dale Warren, Deceased,
and as such, the parties have proper standing and interest for this proceeding.
3 As grounds for her Contest of Will, Contestant would show to this Honorable Court
and jury that the purported October 31, last year Will of her father, James Dale
Warren, Deceased, was executed at a time and under such circumstances when he was
not of sound mind and did not possess sufﬁcient capacity to make a will. Because the
decedent lacked testamentary capacity, as that term is deﬁned by law, at the time of his
execution of the purported October 31, last year Will, said document is not the valid
Will of James Dale Warren, Deceased, and is therefore null and void.
4 As additional and/or alternative grounds for her Contest of Will, your Contestant
would show this Honorable Court and Jury that the purported October 31, last year
Will of her father, James Dale Warren, Deceased, was executed at a time and under
such circumstances that James Dale Warren, Jr. exercised over the decedent and over
the mind and will of the decedent such inﬂuence or dominion as prevented the
alleged Will from being the decedent’s own free will and constituted it instead the will
of the Proponent. Because the decedent executed the purported October 31, last year
Will under the proponent’s undue inﬂuence, as that term is deﬁned by law, said
document is not the valid Will of James Dale Warren, Deceased, and is therefore null
and void.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, by reason of the above and forego-
ing, your Contestant must generally deny the allegations in support of probate
offered by Proponent’s Application for Probate, and Contestant prays that the
purported October 31, last year Will of James Dale Warren, Deceased, be denied
admission to probate and be declared null and void on the grounds of lack of tes-
tamentary capacity and/or undue inﬂuence with respect to the execution thereof,
and Contestant prays further that she be given such other relief, at law or in equity,
to which she may be entitled and for which she will ever pray.
Respectfully submitted,
Portia Lawson,
Attorney for Contestant, Susan Warren Gearhart

Analysis of Evidence
Answer to Petition for Contest of Will
NOW COMES James Dale Warren, Jr., acting as Defendant and Proponent herein,
and ﬁles this Answer to the Petition for Contest of Will and would respectfully show
the Court and jury the following:
1 Paragraph 1 is admitted.
2 Paragraph 2 is admitted.
3 Paragraphs 3 and 4 are denied, and your Proponent would show that there is no legal
or factual basis upon which the Last Will and Testament of James Dale Warren,
Deceased, dated October 31, last year, should be declared null and void or denied
admission to probate.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Proponent/Defendant prays that
the Original Petition for Contest of Will be denied and that this Court enter judg-
ment for Proponent in accordance with the facts and law and for such other and
further relief to which he may be entitled.
Respectfully submitted,

you were growing up. Your half sister, Susan, has remarried recently, to a guy named

and the kids. I have been here in this Home since April, and I don’t mind it too much,
except I really miss watching Kim and James grow up. I love them like they were my
own.
I have thought about your problem of needing a grub-stake to produce your new
play. I have decided to ﬁnd a way to help you. It would really make me feel wonderful
if I could help you do something great in your life.
I really look forward to your next phone call and especially to your promised visit
in the near future.

Analysis of Evidence
Statement of Susan Gearhart
My name is Susan Warren Gearhart. I live at 4250 Riverside Lane, Happy Valley,
Nocona. I am thirty-nine years old. My father was James Dale Warren, and my
mother was Mary Warren, who is now deceased. I have a half-brother named Jim
from my father’s ﬁrst marriage to Elizabeth Warren, who, as far as I know, is dead.
My father and Elizabeth Warren were divorced when my half-brother was about
two years old.
Ten years ago on July 4, last year, I married Bill Gearhart. Bill is my second
husband, and my ﬁrst husband’s name was Tom Smith. By Tom Smith, I had a son,
James Warren Smith, who is now twelve years old, and a daughter, Mary Kimberly
Smith, who is now ten years old. When Tom and I married, we continued living in
my father’s home with him, since my mother had recently passed away, and I didn’t
want to leave my father all alone. Tom was a salesman, and he was on the road a lot,
so it worked out well for me to live at home and have Dad there to help raise the
kids when they came along. About a year after Kim was born, Tom Smith divorced
me, and I continued to live there with my father in our family home on Riverside
Lane. Actually, I have never lived anywhere other than on Riverside Lane, except for
the times when I was away at school.
My dad’s health began to fail long ago, and I never felt comfortable leaving him
alone in the house for the last four or ﬁve years. I had discussed moving out of the
house with him, but he was very opposed to it, especially since he enjoyed having
Jamie, his namesake grandson, and Kim there with him. He was a very devoted
grandparent, and my children were extremely devoted to him. I know he would
never have failed to include me and my children in his will, if he were in his right
mind.
When I was growing up here in Happy Valley, I had an almost perfect rela-
tionship with my parents, and they had a wonderful relationship with each other.
My father told me that he and Elizabeth had gotten a divorce because he couldn’t
stand her constant bad temper, complaints and nagging. He never spoke kindly
of her. As for my half-brother, Jim, my dad told me he had been sending child
support for the ﬁrst twenty years of Jim’s life and had never gotten a thank you
for anything from Jim or Elizabeth. It seemed to hurt him that Jim never wrote
to thank him for the presents my father used to send him. He was a very ungrate-
ful boy. I can remember that he used to telephone our house back when he was
in high school, and he would always be rude to me and my mother. He would
say something like, “Let me speak to the old man.” Sometimes my dad would
be in when Jim would call, and my dad would always get really upset after their
conversations. My dad always said that each telephone call was for the purpose
of asking for money to buy something extravagant, like a car or a travel ticket.
When I was just about right out of high school, Jim decided to come to Happy
Valley, probably to try to borrow money again. By then, my mother was very ill
and suffering from a nervous condition caused by her medication, and I prayed

Jim would not show up to upset our household. I warned Mother in advance that
he might possibly show up, because I thought it might be harmful to her to be
surprised by his visit. Sure enough when he showed up, he was something of a
surprise.
When Jim arrived at the front door, he was wearing ﬁlthy rags and had a long
beard and long hair. I reluctantly let him in after he told me who he was, and I
took him into my father’s study and introduced my dad to Jim. I think they had
met a few times over the years, but I doubt that he could have recognized Jim as
his own son on that day. I then left the room, and the only thing I heard about
their conversation was when I walked by and heard Jim saying things about how
tough it was to be a poor student and that he would appreciate any help my father
might give him. My father then announced a principle that I had often heard him
say, and that was, “A man ought to make it on his own, or not at all.” The rest of
what I heard were just a few mumblings which sounded kind of like an argument
to me. I don’t recall how long Jim was there. When Jim left my father’s study, he
walked out into the hall and asked me if I would give him a ride. As I headed for
my coat, he asked me also to see if I could pick up some money for him to use
or else he just might have to stay around a few days. I then went upstairs and got
some money I had been given as a present. When we got in the car, Jim asked
me again for some money, and I gave it to him and told him that he should use
it to leave town and that he should not come back to upset my family any more.
I should have listened to him at the time, because he laughed at me and told
me that he would be back and that he would get whatever he wanted out of the
old man.
Over the next several years, Jim never called one time that I know of to speak
with my dad, and he never wrote any letters that I saw, either. I don’t think he ever
came to visit, because I certainly didn’t see him. I have heard from other people
that Jim turned out to be a drug addict, and I think he was on drugs the day he
came to see my dad way back there, or at least he looked like it. My dad never talked
about him or Elizabeth to me after that visit, and we continued to have a good life
together, until my dear mother died when I was about twenty-three years old. Two
years later, I married Tom Smith, and he moved into my house, so I could continue
to take care of my dad.
Several years after my divorce, I met Bill Gearhart, and we were engaged for over
a year before we ﬁnally married. My dad was aware that I was going to marry Bill,
but he never really said very much about it to me. I don’t think he liked Bill, but
then he never thought anyone was good enough for his daughter – just a typical
father. The only comment he ever made to me was after Bill and I got married,
he seemed a little surprised that Bill would be willing to live in another man’s
home, in the same house where I had been married and living with Tom Smith,
and he repeated his old philosophy that a man should succeed on his own or not
at all.

Analysis of Evidence
On many occasions, my father used to tell me that it was his intention to leave the
home on River Lane to me so that I could raise Jamie and Kim properly. The home
is worth probably $250,000 in today’s market in Happy Valley. He also told me he
wanted me to have everything else of his in return for the years I had spent taking
care of him. We had a wonderful relationship, and it certainly came as no surprise
to me that I would be his sole beneﬁciary in his will. On May 26, last year, I was
with him when he sat down and wrote out a will leaving the house and everything
to me.
My dad’s health had gotten to be really poor, and it seemed to me that he would
be much better off where nursing care would be available in the event anything
serious happened. The doctors told me he had all sorts of problems which could at
any moment result in an emergency, which is, of course, what ﬁnally did happen to
him when he had the stroke. After Bill and I married, sometimes he would go with
me to the nursing home to visit my dad, but of course Dad paid the most attention
to Jamie and Kim when we visited. I was there practically every day, and I felt he
was really happy there, or I would have taken him back home with me. My dad
had a roommate named Ernie Potter, whom he seemed to like quite a bit, although
Mr. Potter always seemed to be ﬂaky and sour-acting when I saw him. Certainly my
father never objected to me about staying at the nursing home instead of living in
his home with me and the kids.
Sometime in the middle of the summer, my half-brother called to tell me he
wanted to speak with my dad. I can’t really recall when it was, it could have been
anytime during the summer months. I told him where Dad was and gave him the
address where he could write to him. I know he later called my husband one day
while I was visiting with my dad and asked for the information again, telling Bill
that he had lost it. Bill gave him the phone number and address where my dad could
be reached. So far as I know, he never bothered to call or write, at least my dad never
mentioned it if he did.
On October 28, last year, I received a phone call from the Happy Valley Nursing
Home just as I ﬁnished feeding old Cassie. At that time, I learned that my dad
had suffered a stroke, which they believed to be a mild stroke, and that they were
going to put him in the hospital wing for treatment and observation. I rushed
on down to the hospital and stayed with him all of the time that they permitted
me to during that day. He really wasn’t quite right on that day, and he didn’t act
like himself at all. He was having a terrible time talking and he was weepy and
depressed. I was very worried about him, but the nurses kept telling me he was
doing very well. I was never able to talk with the doctors before I left to go home that
night.
On the next morning, I was on my way to the hospital to see my dad and spend
the day with him, when I was involved in a terrible car accident. The guy ran a stop
sign and hit me broadside. I hit my nose on something and broke it, which gave
me two black eyes later on. It also caused me to cut my lip and my forehead, and
I really looked horrible. Also, I broke several ribs and could barely breathe. I was

taken to Valley Hospital in an ambulance, where I was admitted for treatment of my
injuries. I called Bill at work and told him about it and told him to call the hospital
to advise them that I would not be there because of my injuries. I also told Bill that
he should instruct the nurses and doctors not to mention my injuries to my dad,
because it would upset him under the circumstances. When Bill got to the hospital
to see me, he had already called the Happy Valley Hospital and had told them of
my situation. Bill also told me that the nurses said not to worry about Mr. Warren,
because he was in very good condition. At some point in time, Bill went over to the
Happy Valley Hospital to check up on my dad, and he told me my dad had been
sleeping peacefully when he saw him.
On October 30, 1 called my dad’s room twice, hoping to speak with him. I had
decided that maybe I would tell him I had caught a cold or something and that I
would not be able to visit with him because it might be contagious. A man answered
the phone and told me that Mr. Warren was doing very well, but that he could not
talk on the telephone because of doctor’s orders and that Mr. Warren couldn’t really
speak very well anyway. I asked the man to tell my dad that I had called and that
I would call him back. I also asked the man to give my dad best wishes from his
grandchildren. The man did not tell me his name, I am certain, and I did not ﬁnd
out until later that it was probably my half-brother, Jim. By October 31, my face
was really black and blue, and I looked absolutely frightening. I again concluded
I simply could not possibly go to visit my dad in that condition. I was discharged
from the hospital during the afternoon of October 31, and stayed at home. Again, I
called my dad’s room and was told by the same male voice just about the same story,
and now I believe that it was my half-brother, Jim, to whom I spoke. I also called
the nurses’ station and spoke with a nurse by the name of Pat Duffey, with whom I
had been casually acquainted back in high school. She had heard about my accident
and asked me how I was doing. I explained to her that I had been discharged from
the hospital, but that I looked too awful to come to visit my dad. She reassured
me that my dad appeared to be in pretty stable condition. She suggested that 1
should put on some makeup and come in to visit my dad whenever I felt like I
could, because she explained that it had been her experience that stroke patients
could not be considered really stable for a few weeks after an initial problem. I
believe that telephone call was between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. in the afternoon of
October 31, [last year].
Around 11:30 that evening, Pat Duffey called me to tell me that my dad had taken
a terrible turn for the worse and that his condition had resulted in his receiving
a great deal of emergency care and attention, but to no avail. She told me my
dad had passed away. She also told me that my brother was there and would be
able to take care of all of the arrangements and details and for me not to worry
about coming to the hospital that night if I didn’t feel able. I was shocked to learn
of my brother’s presence, and told her that I did not have any idea that he had
been there at all. Pat Duffey told me she was surprised that I did not know of it
and had assumed that I had known that he had been there constantly for three

care of everything, and by the time we arrived at the hospital, Jim was no longer
there.

NOTARY PUBLIC
My Commission Expires at Death.
Statement of Pat Duffey, R.N.
My name is Pat Duffey. I live alone at 3737 South Street, Happy Valley, Nocona.
I am thirty-seven years old, and I have been employed as a primary care nurse in
the Happy Valley Nursing Home Hospital since I obtained my M.S.N. at Nocona
University. I am occasionally assigned to be the nurse on duty in the nursing home
wing of Happy Valley Nursing Home, but usually my duties involve only the hos-
pital wing. I have known James Warren since April 15, when he moved to the
Home.
On the 27th through the 31st of October of last year, I covered the morning shifts
for a nurse who was ill who was assigned to the Home wing. My regular shift at the
hospital was the 3-11 shift, which I also worked that week.
On the morning of the 28th of October, James Warren had a mild stroke in
his room at Happy Valley Nursing Home, and he was immediately moved to the
hospital wing for special care for his condition. That evening, I checked on him and
found his daughter, Susan, with him. He was in stable condition, physically, but he
was mentally slightly disoriented, which is typical of the stroke patients which I have
attended. He was being medicated to keep him calm to avoid his being excessively
frustrated by his confusion. I observed him become somewhat depressed about his
inability to speak properly at times. He was sort of childlike in his dependency on
his daughter. For example, he began to cry when she tried to go home, and she had
to stay until he went to sleep.
Next morning I received a call on duty at the Home, and it was Bill Gearhart
telling me about Susan’s accident. Shortly thereafter, I met Jim Warren and told
him about the accident. I told him to please not mention it to James Warren, and
he assured me that he had no intention of bringing up Susan or her accident to
Mr. Warren.
On October 30 and 31, I saw Jim Warren in his father’s room throughout my
entire 3–11 shifts. I noticed on the 30th of October that he had shaved off the beard
and mustache which he had on the ﬁrst day, and I also noticed that he was wearing

new clothes. He had brought in several ﬂower arrangements and other gifts for his
father. I assumed he was very devoted to his father, because each time I would go
into the room, on the 30th of October, Jim would be sitting on the side of the bed, or
standing at the side of the bed, telling his father details about his being a playwright
and some of the stories he had written. On the 30th, Mr. Warren seemed to improve
quite a bit in his speaking ability, and once during my shift, he asked me quite plainly
to ﬁnd out why Susan had not come to see him since his stroke. I realized that he
was still a little disoriented and confused when he made that comment, but at least
his speech was getting better.
On the 31st of October, I checked on Mr. Warren immediately after beginning
my 3–11 shift. Jim Warren was still in his father’s room talking to him constantly.
When I walked into the room around 3:30, I saw that Mr. Warren was holding a pen
in his hand and a blank sheet of paper was in front of him. I assumed he couldn’t
speak well and that he was going to try to write things he wanted to say. I took
Mr. Warren’s blood pressure and had to remove the pen from his hand. At that time,
Mr. Warren was able to say a few words which were reasonably well articulated, and
I don’t recall him saying anything that didn’t make sense or anything like that. I
remember only that he stated that he was very tired when I asked him how he was
feeling.
As I left the room, I saw Mr. Warren motion to his son, and Jim Warren got up
and put the pen back into his father’s hand and started talking to him again.
At the nurses’ station, while one of the nurses was complaining about all of the
drugs missing lately, I answered a call from Susan Gearhart inquiring as to her
father’s condition. I tried to be reassuring to her in order not to worry her too
much, just in case her injuries were still severe. However, I felt uneasy about her
father’s condition and encouraged her to attempt to come to the hospital to visit
him if she felt she could. I feel terrible about not having mentioned to her at that
time that Jim Warren was there, but I really didn’t know the relationship between
the two. I’m sure if I had mentioned that he was there, this whole thing wouldn’t
have happened to her.
Each time I went back to see Mr. Warren for the remainder of my shift until
about 7:00, he was asleep, or at least appeared to be, except for once when I looked
in and saw him writing on a piece of paper with Jim standing beside him helping
him to write. I couldn’t say whether Jim could have read the words on the paper
from his position or not, and I think I observed that occurrence shortly before we
served dinner, although I really can’t say for sure when it was.
Around 7:30 p.m., Jim Warren came running out to the nurses’ station and said
his father appeared to be getting very weak and was having difﬁculty breathing.
He was really panic-stricken. From that point on, James Warren’s condition went
steadily downhill, and nothing we did seemed to do any good. Jim Warren stayed in
the room until we ordered him to leave, because he was extremely emotionally upset
and kept saying, “Please, Dad, not now, Dad,” and things to that effect. The doctor

walked out to tell Jim Warren of his father’s death, and I went to the telephone to
advise Susan Gearhart. It was at the time of that ﬁrst telephone conversation that I
ﬁrst mentioned Jim Warren’s presence to her and learned she had known nothing
of his being in town.
I stood there and observed the doctor as he ﬁlled out the attached clinical
summary. It is a report the doctors always prepare promptly upon the discharge of
our patients in the routine or regular course at the hospital. After it was prepared,
it was placed in the permanent ﬁle we keep on every patient that is treated in the
hospital.

Statement of Ernest Potter
My name is Ernest Potter, I am seventy-ﬁve years old, and I reside at the Happy
Valley Nursing Home – all of which is against my will. About the only good thing
that’s happened to me since my daughter stuck me here in the so-called Happy
Valley is that I met up with James Warren, rest his soul. We spent a lot of time
together, and we got to be really good friends before he died. I never had much use
for his daughter, Susan, and I think it was mutual judging from the way she used to
stare at my crippled hand and my wheel chair like I was something from outer space.
It was always a wonder to me that my friend James continued to look forward to
her visits, which were pretty frequent, just as though she hadn’t run him out of his
own house and home and dumped him in a nursing home. I expect he might have
looked forward to her visits mainly because he was crazy about his grandchildren,
Kim and James. You could look around his side of our room and tell that from
all the pictures he kept hanging on the wall of those kids. The only time we ever
talked about James’s son, Jim, was when he would talk about how disappointed he
was that Jim had turned out to be a starving artist trying to make it as an actor.
He told me he had the guilties about divorcing Jim’s mother, Elizabeth Warren,
right after young Jim was born, since he never spent any time being Jim’s father
after that. I used to try to talk him out of worrying so much about his kids, since
I didn’t think they were apparently very worried about him at the time, especially
after old Susan married “the Golddigger,” as James used to call him. Once or twice
the Golddigger, Bill Gearhart, would come along with little Susan to visit James,
and I could see James immediately change into a bad mood. He would either get
depressed or red-faced angry, and pretty soon they’d be arguing like they always

did about how much high-living Bill Gearhart was doing. I remember one day they
had a really big argument about the fact that the Golddigger had put the kids into
a private school, which James thought was too expensive and would turn the kids
into pampered weaklings.
A couple of months before James passed away, rest his soul, he got a phone call
from his son, Jim, from New York. It really did him a lot of good, kicked his spirits
up pretty high. From what I heard, a part of the conversation concerned Jim’s asking
for some help, because I heard James say, “It’s about time I did something for my
own son, so don’t be ashamed of asking.” They talked for about half an hour, and
James hung up and said to me, “Well, Ernest, I’ve still got a chance to be a father to
my son, and I’m going to do it this time.” We talked a lot longer, about how glad he
was to have heard from Jim.
Right then, he sat down and wrote a letter, to Jim I think, although I don’t know
whether he mailed it.
I’ll never forget the day James had his stroke, right there in our room, and I
called the people in charge at the Home and told them he was bad sick, and that
was on October 28, last year, right after breakfast. As soon as they came and got
James and took him around to the hospital wing of the Home, I went through
James’s telephone number book until I found his son’s number in New York. I
called him and told him that his dad had had a stroke. Early the next morning, Jim
arrived from New York and came directly to my room to thank me for having called
him and to visit with me about his dad. Then he went on up to the hospital wing
to visit with his dad, and I didn’t see him again until the morning of the 31st of
October.
I never did see that Susan, and I don’t know if she even bothered to come by to
see James in the hospital, but I do know the nurses said they had called her to tell
her that he had apparently suffered a stroke. I never heard from anybody where she
was, but I think it would have done James some good to get to see his grandchildren
if she had bothered to bring them up there.
On the morning of October 31, last year, Jim came by my room and told me that
James wanted me to come in for a visit, and Jim told me that he had been with his
father constantly since he had arrived. Jim then rolled me around to the hospital
wing and we went in to see James together. James looked tired and not well at all.
He told me he was glad to see me, and we just talked a little bit generally. He seemed
to be at peace with himself. He told me he had really enjoyed spending some time
with his son, Jim, at last, and that he had something really important to do that
I could help him with. He told me he wanted me to come back after supper that
night, because he thought he would have something for me to sign and keep for
him. During the conversation, he never even brought up Susan or her kids, or the
Golddigger.
Later in the day, I don’t remember when, I got a call from Jim reminding me
to be back after supper, and I told him I sure would be. He also mentioned to me

Analysis of Evidence
that I should not bring up Susan or her family, because he thought that might
upset James. Of course, right after suppertime, about 6:30 p.m., I went on back
down to see James, since I sure wanted to help him with anything I could. As I
pushed open the door, Jim looked a little startled at me, and just as I was about
to come in, James sat up in bed and looked in my direction and said just as plain
as anything, “Is that you, Elizabeth?” Jim put his hands on his shoulders and sort
of pushed him back into the bed and asked him to be calm and not worry any
more and said a few things like that to him in a very kindly way. James never
said anything else I could understand while I was there for the next few minutes,
and he just kept staring at Jim and had a little smile on his face. I was only there
a few minutes when Jim asked me to come on out in the hall. He handed me a
piece of paper and told me that it was the thing James had wanted me to help
with. Jim told me it was his dad’s will, and he said to me, “Ernest, you should
take this and put this in Dad’s room, wherever he keeps his papers, and don’t
ever tell anyone about it, until I give you the go ahead. That’s the way Dad would
want it.”
I took the Will back to my room, and the next morning, I decided to read it. I
could see that it was in James’ handwriting, and since he had told me that there
was something he wanted me to sign, I ﬁgured he wanted me to be his witness on
his Will. So I wrote down at the bottom of it, “I, Ernest Potter, am a witness to this
Will.”
That night, on October 31, James passed away, and I lost the best friend a man
could have. The next morning, Jim came by my room and picked up the Will from
me. Since that time, Jim has been kind enough to stay in touch with me by a few
phone calls and visits at the Home. In fact, I hear more often from him than I do
my own daughter.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
369
When I was two years old, my mother and my father divorced, and my mother
eventually told me that the divorce came about due to my father’s having devel-
oped a relationship with Mary, whom he later married. For the ﬁrst few years of
my childhood, I had little contact with my father, since the divorce was not on a
particularly pleasant basis, but I always received a Christmas present and a birthday
present from him every year. I don’t know what kind of support he might have sent
my mother to raise me, but I know that I did not receive anything from my father
to help me get through college or drama school, although I was well aware that he
could afford to help me if he chose. During my last year in college, I traveled to
Happy Valley, Nocona, to renew my relationship with my father. That was when I
ﬁrst met Susan Warren Gearhart, my half-sister.
In advance of my trip, I called to make arrangements with my dad, but I was only
able to speak with Susan. She seemed very unhappy about my plan to visit with
my dad, but I ignored her. When I arrived in Happy Valley, I was not very warmly
received by Susan or her mother, Mary, who was still living at that time. As it turned
out, they had not even told my father that I would be arriving, and I suppose they
just hoped I might not ever show up due to the way they had discouraged me from
coming. My father took some time off from his work to visit with me, and I really
enjoyed meeting him.
At the time, I looked pretty much like a bum or a “hippie.” I guess my father
was a little bit disturbed by my appearance, and he told me I probably wouldn’t be
able to make very much of a career for myself by being a drama major in college.
On the other hand, he was genuinely glad to get to visit with me and encouraged
me to come back whenever I could ﬁnd time in the future. As I was leaving, Susan
offered to take me to the bus station. During that ride, Susan told me I should
not return to Happy Valley because it upset her mother, Mary, too much, and she
explained that Mary was in a very weak physical condition. She told me my father
was doing ﬁne and was very happy and that I should not stir up any problems for
him or his family. She said if anything ever came up that I should know about that
she would certainly keep in contact with me. Then, of all things, when I got out
of the car she jammed two $50 bills into my shirt pocket and told me she hoped
that would help me out a little. I guess I didn’t really hold that against her any,
and I certainly did look like a bum, but that was a pretty insulting thing for her
to do.
Over the next many years, I was able to speak with my father only a few times,
since most of the telephone calls to his home were intercepted by Susan. I never
heard back from him when Susan took my calls. I really didn’t put too much more
effort into getting in touch with my father, because I was working so hard on trying
to make it as an actor, or as a playwright. I got mixed up with drugs once and had a
hard time pulling myself back together, and I wouldn’t doubt but that Susan made
sure her father learned about that. Finally, I got some real encouragement by the
success of one of my plays at a community theatre, and I took my life and my writing
more seriously.

Analysis of Evidence
In about April of last year, I ﬁnished one of my scripts and took it around to
several agents, producers and other people in the business to see whether they
thought it might be a Broadway potential. Nearly everyone I spoke with told me it
looked like it had the makings of a big success. The only problem was that everyone
I spoke with told me I’d have to give up almost all of the proﬁts on the thing to
those who would be providing ﬁnancial backing for the production. The more I
checked into it, the more I realized that if I couldn’t put up a healthy sum of money
of my own, that I’d have to give up all of the control over the production, as well as
almost all of the proﬁt in order to get the play produced. It was then that I began
considering contacting my dad to see if he would provide me with some ﬁnancial
help.
Sometime mid-May 20, I tried to contact my dad, but Susan received the phone
call and was pretty vague about where my father was and whether or not he would
call me back. I tried again to call my father sometime in the middle of July, and
the same thing happened. Finally, in early October I called the house and Susan’s
husband, Bill Gearhart, answered, and he told me that my father was in the Happy
Valley Nursing Home and gave me the telephone number. I couldn’t believe my
father was in a nursing home, since Susan had not even told me he was in poor
health, much less that she had put him in a home.
On October 12, I called my dad and spoke with him in a long telephone conver-
sation which must have lasted over an hour. It was the best talk we ever had. My
dad was very interested in helping me ﬁnance my play, and he talked about loaning
me some money or working out some way by which he could help me protect my
interest in my work. He had a lot of personal things to say to me, which he had
never expressed before, about his own feelings about having not been around when
I was a kid and not having been responsible for helping me out with anything.
I told him that none of that was important and that, of course, I didn’t expect
him to help me out now just to make up for all the things he had failed to do in
the past.
Shortly after that I received a letter from him which again stated his interest in
helping me with my play. I was making plans to visit with him as soon as I could
get away from New York. Then, out of the blue, came a call from Ernest Potter, who
explained that he was my father’s roommate at Happy Valley Nursing Home. He
told me my father had suffered a stroke and was in pretty bad shape. I thanked him
and told him I would be coming to Happy Valley as soon as I could get there and
that I would come by his room to see him.
I traveled all night long to get to Happy Valley, Nocona, and when I arrived the
next morning at the Happy Valley Nursing Home, I headed to the room number
on my dad’s letter. A nurse saw me about to enter the room and asked if I knew
Mr. Warren, and 1 explained that I was his son. I have since learned that this nurse’s
name is Pat Duffey. She told me that they had just received a call that Mr. Warren’s
daughter, Susan, had been involved in a car wreck on the way to the hospital. The

nurse said Susan received some injuries to her face and other injuries that were not
life threatening. The nurse said Susan could not come to see her father as a result.
She explained that it would be best for Mr. Warren, in his condition, not to know
about the incident, and she asked me to be certain not to mention it. She further
stated she was glad I was going to be there in order that someone from the family
would be present during Mr. Warren’s recovery period. I went on to my dad’s and
Ernest Potter’s room, and Ernest was there. He seemed really happy to meet me,
and I sat down for a few minutes to inquire as to my dad’s condition. He said he
didn’t know very much, and so I went on to the hospital wing to see my father.
When I arrived at his room, I found my father awake and quite alert. He was glad
to see me, but he asked why I had bothered to ﬂy out to see him before he returned to
feeling a little better. I explained to him that I wanted to be there with him because I
thought he might need me for support and comfort while he attempted to get back
on his feet. We then began talking generally about just a lot of things, nothing in
particular. I guess we must have talked a couple of hours that morning, which was
October 29, I believe. I would say that I did most of the talking, since he was still
having some speech problems. A few times, he asked me about where Susan was,
and I pretty much dodged the question. As soon as they brought in his medication,
around noon, I left to go and check into a motel room and came back later in the
afternoon for about an hour. Then I came to visit him for a couple of hours in
the early evening. His condition stayed about the same all day long, and he was
extremely pleased to see me. He asked me to come spend the day with him the next
day.
The next day, which was October 30, I brought some of my work to his room to
sit there and write some letters to some people I was working with on my new play.
Of course, in my father’s condition, I couldn’t bring up the topic of my need for
some ﬁnancial support from him, but we did talk about my work a little bit, and
he seemed very interested in my telling him about some of the things I had written.
He also asked me to talk to him about Elizabeth, my mother, and about our life in
New York City. I spent most of the day just sitting either in his room or down the
hall working on my own things, since I didn’t want him to tire out. During the day,
Susan called while I was there and I told her he was doing quite well and I’m sure
I told her who I was. She showed about as much interest in me as she always had.
Also, once when I was down the hall, I saw a man walk in to see my father while
my father was sleeping, and I subsequently learned that it was Bill Gearhart. I don’t
know whether they were able to visit, but I doubt it, since my father was asleep at
the time. Just as I was about to leave on the evening of October 30, [last year], my
dad asked me to be sure and come back to visit the next day, and then he said to
me, “I really doubt that I will ever live to see the outside of this hospital, and there
are a few things I haven’t taken care of yet.”
The next morning when I returned to my father’s room, he asked me to get Ernest
Potter to come visit him. I did so, and he and Ernest had a nice visit that morning.
