I don’t think theres anything else heaps of little things were said that I cant
remember but you can judge what they were – because you know me and him.
Im writing a letter to Marseilles darlint – this is only a summary of events.
Exhibit 53:
Envelope – Mr. F. Bywaters, P. & O. R.M.S. “Morea,” Marseilles, France.
[Postmark – London, E.C., 14 June, 1922.]
Darlint Pal,
[First paragraphs omitted.]
I wonder how my own pal is feeling – I’m feeling very blue myself – an inactive
sort of drifting feeling, that can’t be described – I suppose its really reaction – I
longing to hear from you next Monday – I hope its a lot.
On our birthday you will be left Aden on your way to Bombay – you’ll be thinking
of a girl whose best pal you are in England wont you – I’ll think of you – all day
every little minute – and keep on wishing you success as I cant be – Perhaps you
can and as you say you are still hoping darlint – so shall I. Time hangs so dreadfully
and just because I want to work it away we are not busy this week and are leaving at
ﬁve. I suppose we shall thro the Summer now. Darlint, how can you get ptomaine
poisoning from a tin of salmon? One of our boys Mother has died with it after being
ill only three days.
One year ago today we went for that memorable ride round the island in the
char-a-bancdoyouremember?LastnightwhenIwenttobedIkissedyougoodnight
in my mind because that was the ﬁrst time you kissed me.
Darlint this month and next are full of remembrances – arnt they?
I went to 49 last night and sat and listened to ailments for about 2 hours – its
awfully exhilarating especially when you feel blue. I also had a small row with them.
He asked why Graham never came to see us and I said “Why do you ask for him to
come round when you know he’s not allowed to.”
This led to words of course and I was told that neither his mother nor his Father
would tell him not to speak to me – my retort was that I knew his Father would not
but It would take more than any of them to convince me his mother would not, and
I wish to God I didnt have to go there – I feel really bad tempered when I come away.
I was taken faint in the train this morning – I didnt quite go off though – On
Saturday I’m going to see a Doctor, I think it is best that I should – I dont like doing
these silly things in public places – I’ve got my costume home – it looks very nice –
Im ever so pleased with it – but I dont want to wear it – I wish you would see me in
it – what would you like me to do? Next week I’ll be writing to the other end of the
world to you darlint – I wish you didnt ever have to leave England, even if I didnt
see you I should feel happier and safe because you would be near – but the sea and
Australia sounds years and years apart, I do so much want my pal to talk to and
conﬁde in and my own man to lean upon sometimes . . .
always,
PEIDI.

Analysis of Evidence
Exhibit 25:
Envelope – Mr. F. Bywaters, P. & O. R.M.S. “Morea,” Sydney, Australia.
[Postmark – London, E.C., June 20, 1922, 1.30 p.m.]
Darlingest Boy I know,
This time last year I had won the sweep stake for the Gold Cup, this year I have
lost £1: 10/- eh way Kings Idler and the result is Golden Myth at 7 to 1, Flamboyant
20 to 1, and Ballyheron 8 to 1. I’m not going to bet any more – even in horse racing
the fates are against me.
You get into Marseilles tonight I wonder how you’re feeling darlint, very blue –
or not feeling anything at all – just drifting – its hard either way isn’t it?
I wish you had taken me with you darlint – I don’t think I will be able to stay on
here all alone – there seems so much to contend with – so long to “dance” when
you’d rather die and all for no deﬁnite purpose. Oh I’ll pack up now, I can’t talk
cheerfully – so I shan’t talk at all goodnight darlint.
It’s Friday now, darlint nearly time to go, I am wondering if you remember what
your answer was to me in reply to my “What’s the matter” tonight of last year.
I remember quite well – “You know what’s the matter, I love you” . . . but you
didn’t then darlint, because you do now and its different now, isn’t it? From then
onwards everything has gone wrong with our lives – I don’t mean to say it was right
before – at least mine wasn’t right – but I was quite indifferent to it being either
right or wrong and you darlint – you hadn’t any of the troubles – or the worries
you have now – you were quite free in mind and body – and now through me you
are not – darlint I am sorry I shouldn’t mind if I could feel that some day I should
be able to make up to you for all the unhappiness I have caused in your life – but I
can’t feel that darlint – I keep on saying to myself that “it will – it shall come right” –
but there is no conviction behind it – why can’t we see into the future?
When you are not near darlint I wish we had taken the easiest way – I suppose it
is because I can’t see you – can’t have you to hold me and talk to me – because when
you are in England I always want to go on trying and trying and not to give up –
to see and feel you holding me – is to hope on, and when I can’t have that I feel a
coward. The days pass – no they don’t pass, they just drag on and on and the end of
all this misery and unhappiness is no nearer in sight – is anything worth living for?
There are 2 halves in this world who want nothing on earth but to be joined
together and circumstances persistently keep them apart – nothing is fair – nothing
is just – we can’t even live for ourselves – can we?
I suppose the week end will pass somehow – the only thought that helps is that
you will talk to me on Monday.
Goodbye darlingest boy – I do wish you were here.
Its Monday now darlint, that day you came up and took me to lunch at the Kings
Hall do you remember?

Things are very quiet here and Mr. Carlton has taken 2 or 3 days off this week.
He told me he would come up about Thursday – to ﬁx up the outing on Saturday –
that was the day last year that you and Avis came to an understanding – I wonder
if that’s the right way to put it.
Nothing happened over the week end darlint except that Dad came up on
Saturday and did not go home in the evening. It’s becoming a regular thing now –
I wonder why?
When you are in Australia – darlint you will tell me all you do and where you
go – everything – I want to know.
I shall be in Bournemouth when you’re in Australia think about me darlingest
boy – it won’t be the holiday I anticipated will it? I certainly shant learn to swim
neither shall I be playing tennis it won’t be nice at all – because I shan’t even be
able to escape things and beings by going up to town each day – but it’s one of
those things that have to be gone thro in this life I lead and all the railings against
it won’t alter a tiny bit of it – so I must dance thro somehow. Are you going to see
Harold? if you do, try and knock a bit of sense into him please darlint pour moi and
write and tell me what he is doing, – how is he getting on – everything – he writes
such nonsense that you can’t tell from a letter what he really is doing. He’s written
to Doris Grafton and tells her, he is sending over her passage money and she is to
come out and marry him – and a lot more of rot like that – darlint I’m sure he’s not
normal sometimes.
See what my pal can do for me, please.
Won’t you have a long time to wait for a letter from me this time, Darlint? I have
been looking at the mail card and see you do not arrive in Australia until July 22nd –
I’m so sorry – I wish I could afford to cable you a long long letter to somewhere
before Sydney, or better still, to be able to phone to you and hear you say “Is that
Peidi?”
I went to see a doctor on Saturday he asked me lots of questions – could he
examine me etc – I said no – then he said are you enciente? to which I replied “No,
I think not,” but explained to him how I felt. Eventually he came to the conclusion
that I have “chronic anaemia” – which will probably turn to pernicious anaemia if
I am not careful.
I asked him exactly what this was and he said, “all your blood every drop turns
to water.”
I also asked him if it was a usual thing for any one to have and he said “No” only
much older people suffer with it; as a rule – only younger people, when they have
had an accident and lost a lot of blood, have you had one? he said.
I said “No” – because it wasn’t really an accident and I didn’t want to tell him
everything – he might have wanted to see my husband.
But I expect thats what has really caused this anaemia – because I lost an awful
lot of blood.

Analysis of Evidence
The doctor says I must drink Burgundy with every meal – 4 glasses a day – I don’t
know how I am going to do that – I hate the stuff.
He has given me some medicine as well and a box of pills to be taken until I am ill.
Darlint are you disappointed it is only that? tell me please.
I’ve just come back from getting the Marseilles Mail at the G.P.O.
What an utterly absurd thing to say to me “Don’t be too disappointed.”
You can’t possibly know what it feels like to want and wait each day – every little
hour – for something – something that means “life” to you and then not to get it.
You told me from Dover that you were going to talk to me for a long time at
Marseilles and now you put it off to Port Said.
You force me to conclude that the life you lead away from England – is all
absorbing that you havn’t time nor inclination to remember England or anything
England holds.
There were at least 5 days you could have talked to me about – if you only spared
me 5 minutes out of each day. But what is the use of me saying all this – it’s the
same always – I’m never meant to have anything I expect or want. If I am unjust – I
am sorry – but I can’t feel anything at present – only just as if I have had a blow on
the head and I am stunned – the disappointment – no, more than that – the utter
despair is too much to bear – I would sooner go under today than anything.
All I can hope is, that you will never never feel like I do today – it’s so easy to write
“try to be brave” its so much harder to be so, nobody knows – but those who try to
be – against such heavy odds.
It’s more to me than anything on this earth – to read what you say to me – you
know this darlint, why do you fail me? What encouragement is it to go on living
and waiting and waiting.
Perhaps I ought not to have written this – perhaps I ought to have ignored having
a scrap only, altogether – but how I feel and what I think I must tell you always.
Darlint I hope you will never never never feel as miserable as

[Postmark – London, E.C., 4 July, 1922.]
Darlingest Boy
First of all last Sunday week a lady I don’t know her name – we all call her “2
jam pots high” asked after – “that nice curly headed boy.” We met her in Ilford in
the evening – I said when I last saw you – you were quite well. I wasn’t by myself
Darlint – he was with me.
I felt quite jealous that she should remember you all this time. Then last Wednes-
day I met your mother and she cut me. I wasn’t prepared for it either – I saw her
coming towards me and thought “as she spoke to me last time we met that there is
no reason why she shouldn’t this time.” And as she came up I just smiled, bowed,
said “How do you do” – she just took no notice whatever and walked on. I can’t
explain how I felt – I think I wanted to hit her more than anything – things get
worse and worse – instead of just a tiny bit better each day.
On Thursday afternoon I went to the G.P.O. for the Port Said Mail and encoun-
tered the ﬁrst man that I saw before – he handed me a registered envelope from
you (which contained the garters – thank you very much darlint) and told me
if I had an address in London I couldn’t have letters addressed to the G.P.O. – I
told him I hadn’t – but I don’t think he believed me anyway he didnt give me
your Port Said letter and I hadnt the patience to overcome (or try to) his bad
temper.
I went again on Monday and got it a different man was on duty – when I read
it – I didnt feel very satisﬁed darlint it didnt seem worth waiting all that time
for – 24 days – however I wont talk about it – you ought to know by now how I feel
about those things.
In one part of it you say you are going to still write to me because it will help, in
another part you say – “Perhaps I shant write to you from some ports – because I
want to help you.” I dont understand – I try to – but I cant – really I cant darling –
my head aches – aches with thinking sometimes.
Last Friday last year – we went to see “Romance” – then we were pals and this
year we seem no further advanced.
Why arnt you sending me something – I wanted you to – you never do what
I ask you darlint – you still have your own way always – If I don’t mind the risk
why should you? whatever happens cant be any more than this existence – looking
forward to nothing and gaining only ashes and dust and bitterness.
I’m not going to ask dad about you at all – I not going to say anything to
anybody – they can all think the worst of me that is possible – I am quite indifferent.
Miss Prior is on holiday and the only person in this world that is nice to me is Mr.
Carlton – I have had 2 half days off and am having another to-morrow afternoon –
all this time off makes me think of last year – when you were with me – rushing
home to see you.

Analysis of Evidence
I’ve had a brandy and soda some mornings – about 11-30 and a half bottle of
champagne between us – other mornings and I learn such a lot of things that are
interesting too.
This morning on the station I saw Molly – talking and laughing with Mr. Derry –
in case you dont remember the name – it’s the little man in the “White Horse.”
I’ve never seen her talk to him before altho she has passed me on the platform
talkingtohimseveraltimes(metalkingtohimImean)Ibowed–saidgoodmorning
to him as I passed and have since been wondering if they have told each other what
they know about me.
Never mind, a little more bad feeling cant hurt – there is such a lot of it to contend
with will you tell me if youd rather I didnt write?

[Postmark – London, W.1., July 14, 1922, 7.15 p.m.]
Darlingest boy – you worry me so much – what do you mean you say “I want to be
in England to look after you.” I can understand that and I want you to be here also –
but you then say “I want you to look after me too”. . . Whats the matter darlint, are
you ill? is anything the matter that I could help you in at all. I do believe youve been
ill – oh darlint why are you such miles away – why arent we together – so that I
could help you. Would you like a pillow? the pillow that only Peidie can give you –
Id love to have you here now so that I could give it you. Do tell me whats the matter
darlingest boy – I shall worry and worry all the time until you write and tell me. Its
Thursday and Ive just come from the G.P.O. with the Aden mail. Isnt it late this time
darlint it’s usually in on a Monday or at latest Tuesday. However Ive got it and thats
all that really matters Darlingest boy didnt I say a long time ago “Dont trust Dan.”
Of course I didnt mean that in the sense you have told me he couldnt be trusted in
but my instinct was right wasnt it? You will be careful wont you darlint pour moi?
I dont want to ever know or think that my own boy is in any predicament of that
sort – because Ill be too far away to help wont I? The thought of anything like that
makes my blood cold – Ill be always worrying. Im writing this letter rather early to
Colombo – because Im going away tomorrow and I shant have an opportunity of
writing to you again for a fortnight. Perhaps I could manage a letter card tho anyway
you’ll understand wont you darlint pal? I dont mind a bit pencil as long as its words
onpaper–itdoesn’tmatter–becausethey’rewhatyousayandthinkanddo–aletter
darlint is like food only you have food everyday to keep you alive and I have a letter
every how many days? 14 sometimes and I have to keep alive on that all that time.
About Bella Donna – no I dont agree with you about her darlint – I hate her – hate
to think of her – I dont think other people made her what she was – that sensual
pleasure loving greedy Bella Donna was always there. If she had originally been

different – a good man like Nigel would have altered her darlint – she never knew
what it was to be denied anything – she never knew “goodness” as you and I know
it – she was never interested in a good man – or any man unless he could appease
her sensual nature. I don’t think she could have been happy with nothing – except
Baroudi on a desert island she liked – no loved and lived for his money or what it
could give her – the luxury of his yacht the secrecy with which he acted all bought
with his money – that’s what she liked.
Yes she was clever – I admire the cleverness – but she was cunning there is a
difference darlint, I don’t admire that – I certainly don’t think she would ever have
killed Nigel with her hands – she would have been found out – she didn’t like that
did she? being found out – it was that secret cunning in Baroudi that she admired
so much – the cunning that matched her own.
If she had loved Baroudi enough she could have gone to him – but she liked the
security of being Nigel’s wife – for the monetary assets it held.
She doesn’t seem a woman to me – she seems abnormal – a monster utterly
selﬁsh and self living.
Darlint this is where we differ about women.
Iusuallystandupforthem against youandinthiscaseitsthereversebuthonestly
darlint I dont call her a woman – she is absolutely unnatural in every sense.
You do say silly things to me – ‘try a little bit every day not to think about me –
doesn’t that ‘trying’ ever make it worse – it does for me always.
About the ‘age’ passages in ‘The Fruitful Vine’ – I marked them because as I read
they struck me as concerning you and I.
Darlint I didn’t do it with malice every passage in any book I read that strikes me
as concerning 2 pals I mark – it doesn’t matter what they are about.
I hadn’t mentioned the subject any more had I?
My veriest own lover I always think about the ‘difference’ when I’m with you
and when I’m away sometimes when I’m happy for a little while I forget – but I
always remember very soon – perhaps some little thing that you might say or do
when we’re together reminds me. Sometimes I think and think until my brain goes
round and round. ‘Shall I always be able to keep you.’ 8 years is such a long time –
it’s not now – it’s later – when I’m ‘Joan’ and you’re not grown old enough to be
‘Darby.’ When you’ve got something that you’ve never had before and something
that you’re so happy to have found – you’re always afraid of it ﬂying away – that’s
how I feel about your love.
Don’t ever take your love away from me darlint – I never want to lose it and live.
If it gets less and gradually fades away – don’t let me live to feel without it. It feels
a bigger fuller greater love that I have for my own and only lover now.
PEIDI.

Darlingest boy, today is the 27th and its on a Sunday, so I am writing this in the
bathroom, I always like to send you greetings on the day – not the day before or the
day after.
Fourteen whole months have gone by now, darlint, its so terribly long. Neither
you nor I thought we should have to wait all that long time did we? although I
said I would wait 5 years – and I will darlint – its only 3 years and ten months

[Postmark – London, E.C., Sept. 12, 1922, 5.30 p.m.]
Darlint Pal,
I’ve got nothing to talk to you about – I can’t think about anything at all –
I can’t even look forward to seeing you. Now you are nearing England – I keep
contrasting this home coming with the previous ones. I have been buoyed up
with hope, bubbling with excitement Just existing with an intense strung up feel-
ing of seeing you and feeling you holding me in your two arms so tightly that it
hurts but this time everything seems different. I don’t hear from you much you
don’t talk to me by letter and help me and I don’t even know if I am going to see
you.
Darlint, I’m an awful little beast I know – I don’t want to be either – but I feel so
hopeless – just drifting – but if you say ‘No I won’t see you’ then it shall be so, I’m
quite reconciled to whatever verdict you send forth and shall say to myself ‘It is for
the best it must be so.’
Darlint you do love me still tho’ don’t you? and you will go on loving me even
if we don’t meet. Things here are going smoothly with me – I am giving all – and
accepting everything and I think am looked upon as ‘The Dutiful Wife’ whose spirit
is at last bent to the will of her husband.’
This isn’t sarcasm or cynicism its exactly how I feel. I had a little letter from
you – by what you said it was written on the 28th of July Ive had nothing – further
there are heaps and heaps of questions in my letters to you.
I wonder if you will answer them, or are they already dismissed? On Saturday I
was so ill. I had to stop away – its not very often I give in so much as stopping away
from business but on Saturday I really had to I’m quite alright now tho’ darlint.
I don’t think I told you I bought a fur coat – at least part of it. It was 27 gns. and
I had £13 saved up – so I borrowed £15 from the account and am paying it back
at £1 per week – the debt is only £10 now.

Also I’ve had to fall back on wearing lace shoes – no don’t make a face darlint,
they are rather nice ones – I wanted grey and could get nothing at all in my usual
style – only with one or two straps across – and I don’t like these – even if they hid
my foot I shouldn’t – they look loud, so I bought lace ones, only to wear with cloth
clothes tho’ darlint – not with silk.
Yesterday you were at Suez – I suppose you got my Port Said letters there and on
Friday or Saturday, you will get these – I think the mail facilities favour you more
than me darlint.
Darlingest pal – do let me hear an awful lot from you next week – I’m just existing
now – I shall live then.

Plain envelope.
Darlingest lover of mine, thank you, thank you, oh thank you a thousand times for
Friday – it was lovely – its always lovely to go out with you.
AndthenSaturday–yesIdidfeelhappy–Ididn’tthinkateenybitaboutanything
in this world, except being with you – and all Saturday evening I was thinking about
you – I was just with you in a big arm chair in front of a great big ﬁre feeling all the
time how much I had won – cos I have darlint, won such a lot – it feels such a great
big thing to me sometimes-that I can’t breathe.
When you are away and I see girls with men walking along together – perhaps
they are acknowledged sweethearts – they look so ordinary then I feel proud – so
proud to think and feel that you are my lover and even tho’ not acknowledged I can
still hold you – just with a tiny ‘hope.’
Darlint, we’ve said we’ll always be Pals haven’t we, shall we say we’ll always be
lovers – even tho’ secret ones, or is it (this great big love) a thing we can’t control –
dare we say that – I think I will dare. Yes I will ‘I’ll always love you’ – if you are dead –
if you have left me even if you don’t still love me, I always shall you.
Your love to me is new, it is something different, it is my life and if things should
go badly with us, I shall always have this past year to look back upon and feel that
‘Then I lived’ I never did before and I never shall again.
Darlingest lover, what happened last night? I don’t know myself I only know how
I felt – no not really how I felt but how I could feel – if time and circumstances were
different.
It seems like a great welling up of love – of feeling – of inertia, just as if I am wax
in your hands – to do with as you will and I feel that if you do as you wish I shall
be happy, its physical purely and I can’t really describe it – but you will understand
darlint wont you? You said you knew it would be like this one day – if it hadn’t
would you have been disappointed. Darlingest when you are rough, I go dead – try
not to be please.
The book is lovely – it’s going to be sad darlint tho’, why can’t life go on happy
always?

I like Clarie – she is so natural so unworldly.
Why ar’nt you an artist and I as she is – I feel when I am reading frightfully
jealous of her – its a picture darlint, just how I did once picture that little ﬂat in
Chelsea – why can’t he go on loving her always – why are men different – I am right
when I say that love to a man is a thing apart from his life – but to a woman it is her
whole existence.
I tried so hard to ﬁnd a way out of tonight darlingest but he was suspicious and still
is – I suppose we must make a study of this deceit for some time longer. I hate it. I
hate every lie I have to tell to see you – because lies seem such small mean things to
attain such an object as ours. We ought to be able to use great big things for great big
love like ours. I’d love to be able to say ‘I’m going to see my lover tonight.’ If I did he
would prevent me – there would be scenes and he would come to 168 and interfere
and I couldn’t bear that – I could be beaten all over at home and still be deﬁant –
but at 168 it’s different. It’s my living – you wouldn’t let me live on him would you
and I shouldn’t want to – darlint its funds that are our stumbling block – until we
have those we can do nothing. Darlingest ﬁnd me a job abroad. I’ll go tomorrow
and not say I was going to a soul and not have one little regret. I said I wouldn’t
think – that I’d try to forget – circumstances – Pal, help me to forget again – I have
succeeded up to now – but its thinking of tonight and tomorrow when I can’t see
you and feel you holding me.
Darlint – do something tomorrow night will you? something to make you forget.
I’ll be hurt I know, but I want you to hurt me – I do really – the bargain now, seems
so one sided – so unfair – but how can I alter it?
About the watch – I didn’t think you thought more of that – how can I explain what
I did feel? I felt that we had parted – you weren’t going to see me – I had given you
something to remind you of me and I had purposely retained it. If I said “come for
it” you would – but only the once and it would be as a pal, because you would want
me so badly at times – that the watch would help you not to feel so badly and if you
hadn’t got it – the feeling would be so great – it would conquer you against your
will.
Darlint do I ﬂatter myself when I think you think more of the watch than of
anything else. That wasn’t a present – that was something you asked me to give
you – when we decided to be pals a sort of sealing of the compact. I couldn’t afford
it then, but immediately I could I did. Do you remember when and where we were
when you asked me for it? If you do tell me, if you don’t, forget I asked.
How I thought you would feel about the watch, I would feel about something I
have.
It isn’t mine, but it belongs to us and unless we were differently situated than we
are now, I would follow you everywhere – until you gave it to me back.

Darlingest boy, thank you –
I know what you say is really true, but darlint it does feel sometimes that we are
drifting. Don’t you ever feel like that – and it hurts so – of ever so much.
Yes, we are both going to ﬁght until we win – darlint, ﬁght hard, in real earnest –

somehow I feel it isnt, I have done ever since the 9th and when I think about it I feel
more so about it. You have not asked me all the time you’ve been home to go with

and I’m wondering – I can’t help it darlint if I’ve done right in asking you to take me
out. And apart from this feeling that I have, there is that ever present question of
money – darlint you’ve never told me this time once about money – what you had
and what you spent and I felt hurt – horribly darlint, especially about the suit – last
time you told me about the coat – but not this time – why the difference darlint?
And as I haven’t any money to give you, at least not much and perhaps you havn’t
any I wish you weren’t going to take me out darlint and even now its not too late – if
you’d only tell me, be quite frank about it darlint, I’ll understand – surely you know
I will. I didn’t intend to mention this darlint, but neither you nor I must harbour
thoughts that each other doesn’t know, must we, we must be one in thoughts and
wishes and actions always darlint, so I have. Please understand how I feel and know
I love you.

[Bywaters’ letters omitted]
4. Evidence from the trial: the Defence
a. Extracts from cross-examination of Bywaters
Did you then tell him that you were in love with his wife? – No.
Did you suggest any grounds upon which either she or he was to obtain a
divorce? – No.
Was divorce mentioned? – Divorce or separation was mentioned.
Were you not at this time attempting to keep back from him all suspicion as to
your relations with Mrs. Thompson? – No, I was not attempting to keep it back.
Did you ever tell him up to that time? – No.
Had you and Mrs. Thompson at that time spoken about suicide? – Yes.
Do you remember when that proposal was abandoned? – Abandoned?
Yes. Was it abandoned? – Yes, the pact of suicide was abandoned.
It is referred to in exhibit No. 62, the letter of 18th November, 1921 –
All I could think about last night was that compact we made. Shall we have to carry it
thro’?
Was that pact of suicide abandoned after that letter? – I never really considered it
seriously.
May we take it from that time forward there was no more thought of the suicide
pact? – Oh yes, there was; it was mentioned.
But not really entertained by you? – No.
Do you say from that time forward the only idea in your mind or hers was divorce
or separation? – Or suicide on her part.
But the suicide, I put to you, after that letter was not seriously entertained? – Not
by me, but by her it was.
Except for the suicide on her part you say that you or she only contemplated
separation or divorce? – That is true, or me to take her away.

Analysis of Evidence
Was the removal of her husband ever mentioned by her to you? – No.
Never? – Never.
Did it ever occur to you that that was a way in which you and she might come
together? – No.
Did her letters suggest it to you? – No.
Did you tell your learned counsel that you read her letters as melodrama? – Some.
What was it you understand as melodrama? – She had a vivid way of declaring
herself; she would read a book and imagine herself as the character in the book.
Do you mean that you read her references to poison as melodrama? – Some as
melodrama; some as general knowledge.
General knowledge? – Yes.
I don’t understand that. What did you understand when she mentioned a par-
ticular poison? – To what are you referring?
Are you aware, or do you remember, that she mentioned several times a poison
in her letters? – Yes.
Did that suggest to you a dose of poison might kill her husband? – No.
It did not occur to you? – No.
Did you not read those letters as meaning that the idea was in her mind? – No.
Did she ever make an actual proposal to you that you and she might go off
together? – Yes.
When did she ﬁrst make it? – I suppose it was about the November when I came
home.
Did you agree to the proposal or did you reject it? – I said, “Wait and see what
happens.”
What were you going to wait for? – To see if she could get a separation or divorce.
And how long were you going to wait? – A period of ﬁve years.
Did you ever mean to do anything to make a divorce possible? – No.
You had no intention of taking any action? – No.
Will you turn to the letter of 1st April, exhibit No. 17. “I thought a lot about what
you said of Dan”? – I had told Mrs. Thompson about a friend of mine named Dan.
That is all you had told her? – I told her of some of his business that he had told
me. I had not told him anything about myself and Mrs. Thompson.
Then will you follow while I read –
Darlint, don’t trust him – I don’t mean don’t tell him anything because I know you never
would – what I mean is don’t let him be suspicious of you regarding that – because if
we were successful in the action – darlint circumstances may afterwards make us want
many friends – or helpers and we must have no enemies – or even people that know a
little too much. Remember the saying “A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.”
What was “the action” that she there refers to? – Suicide, as far as I remember.
But, Bywaters, read it again. What does “the action” mean? – Mrs. Thompson
had proposed to me that she did not want to make my life as unhappy as hers. She
said she would sooner kill herself.

Do you really suggest that “the action” means suicide? – As far as I remember,
yes,it means suicide.
Are you quite clear it does not mean crime? – I am positive of that.
I am coming back to that letter. Look now at exhibit No. 50. This is written before
31st March and you had been home for about a fortnight at the end of January and
again for a few days at the end of March? – Yes
Read what Mrs. Thompson says in that letter –
This time really will be the last time you will go away – like things are, won’t it? We
said it before darlint I know and we failed – but there will be no failure this next time
darlint, there mustn’t be.
Had there been a failure? – Yes.
What had you tried that had failed? – Separation or divorce.
Does it occur to you what was the best way to get a divorce if that was all you
wanted? – Yes, I know the best way of getting a divorce.
What was the best way of getting a divorce for Mrs. Thompson from her
husband? – To provide Mr. Thompson with the information he needed.
Why did you not try? – Because he would not accept.
Did you provide him with the information? – She had.
Had she provided him with the information to enable him to get a divorce? –
She said she would provide him with the information to get a divorce.
Had she tried to give him the information to get a divorce? – She said she would
do it.
My question was had she tried to get a divorce from her husband? – She had sug-
gestedtohimshewantedadivorce,andshewouldprovidehimwiththeinformation
he required if he would come to terms.
I suggest to you that “failure” there refers to the same thing as “action” in the
other letter – that Mrs. Thompson had tried to poison her husband and had failed? –
And I say that that is not true.
What you say is that it refers to information or a statement she had thought of
making to her husband to make him divorce her? – Yes, or separation.
Were you and she really anxious that he should know that you and Mrs.
Thompson were lovers? – He did know.
From what time did he know? – I do not know he exactly knew we were lovers.
He knew we were fond of each other.
Did you not do your best to keep it from him from start to ﬁnish? – Oh no.
Will you turn to the letter of 3rd January, 1922, exhibit No. 13 –
Immediately I have received a second letter, I have destroyed the ﬁrst and when I got
the third I destroyed the second and so on, now the only one I have is the “Dear Edie”
one written to 41, which I’m going to keep. It may be useful, who knows?
Was that the letter of 1st December, exhibit 14, beginning “Dear Edie” and signed
“Yours very sincerely, Freddy”? – Yes.

Analysis of Evidence
Was that the customary way in which you wrote to Mrs. Thompson at that
time? – No.
Was that letter written in that form in order to disarm suspicion? – No.
Did you understand from the passage I have just read from the letter of 3rd
January that she was going to use that letter to disarm suspicion? – No.
Did you understand what was meant when she said “It may be useful – who
knows”? – I do not know.
Would the letter be any use to get a divorce or separation? – I think that she is
referring to the latter.
I take it you would agree with me the letter would not be useful for that
purpose? – I do not agree with you. I never said that.
You do not follow me. You agree with me that that letter which says “Dear Edie,”
and ﬁnishes “Yours very sincerely” would be of no use to enable either her or you
to get a divorce? – That letter was not meant to be a means of getting a divorce. It
was a letter conveying Christmas greetings.
Did you understand what she meant when she said “This letter may be useful;
I will keep it?” – She may have kept this to show to her sister Avis; that was one of
the reasons that I wrote it.
Then you did write it to blind somebody? – Oh yes.
Did the subject of poisons ever occur in your conversations with her when you
were at home? – Sometimes.
In what connection? – General conversation; knowledge.
Who mentioned poisons? – If she had been reading anything and poison was
mentioned, and any matter that she would not understand, she would ask me what
it meant.
Did you know anything about poison? – I did not know very much.
Did she appear to be interested in poison? – No, not particularly.
Did it ever strike you it occupied a prominent place in her mind? – No more
than other things.
Did you take an interest in poison? – I was fond of chemistry when I was at
school.
But chemistry and poison are two different things? – Poisons deal with chemistry.
Poisons come in chemistry.
Did you take any interest in poisons as poisons? – No.
Did you keep up your interest which you say you had in chemistry? – No, I did
not. She knew of that interest, though; her brother used to join me.
Do you suggest then that the mention of poison in your conversation and in your
letters was due to the fact that she knew you were interested in chemistry? Is that
your explanation? – No, my explanation is this: if she had been reading something
and it occurred to her, if I had been in her presence she would have asked me what
it was. If I was not there, she put it in writing.
Do you remember a document which you wrote out containing the troy weights,
exhibit 57? “60 milligrams= 1 grain, 18 grains= 1 gramme, 30 grammes= 1 oz.” Is
that your handwriting? – Yes.

207
When did you write it? – I could not say.
Why did you keep it? – Because it is useful in general knowledge.
Had that any connection with the request she made to you to experiment with
pills? – Oh no.
Turn back to the letter of 1st April, exhibit No. 17, and listen to this paragraph –
He was telling his Mother etc. the circumstances of my ‘Sunday morning escapade’ and
he puts great stress on the fact of the tea tasting bitter ‘as if something had been put
in it’ he says. Now I think whatever else I try it in again will still taste bitter – he will
recognise it and be more suspicious still and if the quantity is still not successful it will
injure any chance I may have of trying when you come home. Do you understand?
What did you understand about that passage? – That she had taken the quinine and
it tasted bitter.
Look at it again –
He puts great stress on the fact of the tea tasting bitter ‘as if something had been put in
it’ he says.
To whom did it taste bitter? – Mrs. Thompson.
Do you suggest that, Bywaters? – I do.
Do you suggest that is how you understood the letter when you received it? – I
do.
Now I think whatever else I try it in again will still taste bitter – he will recognise it and
be more suspicious still.
Do you still adhere to what you say, that she is speaking of her taste? – Yes.
What did you understand him to be suspicious of? – That she was attempting to
commit suicide.
Did you understand her to mean that she would tell him that her tea tasted bitter
and she was about to commit suicide? – Possibly she would.
Is that your understanding of that passage? – That is.
Look at the letter of 1st May (exhibit 19) –
I don’t think we’re failures in other things and we mustn’t be in this.
Did you understand what that referred to? – Yes.
What? – Well, if you read further, “We mustn’t give up as we said.”
What was that? – Give up trying for a separation or divorce.
We must learn to be patient. We must have each other darlint. It’s meant to be I know
I feel it is because I love you such a lot – such a love was not meant to be in vain. It
will come right I know one day, if not by our efforts some other way. We’ll wait eh
darlint, and you’ll try and get some money and then we can go away and not worry
about anybody or anything. You said it was enough for an elephant.
Do you remember saying that? – Yes.
Did you say that in writing or in speech? – In speech.

Analysis of Evidence
Are you clear about that? Did you say it in a letter or in a conversation when you
were at home? – I really do not remember whether it was in conversation or in a
letter.
And what was it you said was enough for an elephant? – The quinine I had given
Mrs. Thompson.
For what had you given her quinine? – She had been wanting me to get her
something with which to commit suicide, as she did not want to make my life as
unhappy as hers. To satisfy her craving I said I would get her something, and I gave
her quinine.
It is your suggestion that in May, 1922, you were lending your assistance to her
desire to commit suicide? – Her suggestion.
You say you gave her this quinine because she wanted something with which to
commit suicide. Is that right? – Yes, that is so.
Did you give her quinine with that object? – I did.
Were you therefore willing to help her to commit suicide? – No, I knew she could
not hurt herself with quinine.
You were playing with her ideas? – I was pulling her leg.
You said it was enough for an elephant. Perhaps it was. But you don’t allow for the taste
making only a small quantity to be taken. It sounded like a reproach was it meant to
be?
That is your explanation, that you were playing a joke upon her? – That is so.
She goes on –
Darlint I tried hard – you won’t know how hard – because you weren’t there to see and
I can’t tell you all – but I did – I do want you to believe I did for both of us . . . I was
buoyed up with the hope of the ‘light bulb’ and I used a lot.
Did you understand that as referring to a dose she herself took of broken glass? –
Possibly, yes. She was trying to persuade me to give her something with which to
commit suicide, and I refrained. I gave her this quinine so that she would not take
anything herself.
But in the next passage that I have called your attention to she refers to another
speciﬁc –
I was buoyed up, with the hope of the ‘light bulb’ and I used a lot – big pieces too.
Did you understand that to mean that she had taken glass? – I understood that to
be a lie from her to me.
You understood, even if it was a lie, that what it was a lie about was what she had
taken herself? – Oh, yes.
ByMr.Justice Shearman –Lookatit.Wasshelyingaboutwhatherhusband
had taken or what she had taken herself? – I say she was lying about what she had
taken herself.
