Analysis of Evidence
their guest and the remaining weeks I paid 25s. per week. The cause of my leaving
was that Mr. Thompson quarrelled with Mrs. Thompson and threw her across the
room. I thought it was a very unmanly thing to do and I interfered. We had a quarrel
and he asked me to leave, and I left. I had always been exceedingly good friends with
Mrs. Thompson. I was also on visiting terms with the mother of Mrs. Thompson,
a Mrs. Graydon, who resides with her husband and family at 231 Shakespeare
Crescent, Manor Park. After I left Mrs. Thompson I went back to reside with my
mother at my present address. On the 7th September, 1921, I got a position as writer
on board the s.s. “Morea.” I sailed on the 9th September and returned to England
the end of the following month. Shortly after I came back from the voyage I called on
Mr.andMrs.Thompsonattheiraddress.Mrs.Thompsonreceivedmequitefriendly,
Mr. Thompson a little coldly, but we parted as friends. The same evening I called
on Mrs. Graydon and I there again saw Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, who were visiting
her. I have never called upon Mr. and Mrs. Thompson since that time. I have met
them once or twice at Mrs. Graydon’s since, the last time being in June last. Since
that date I have never seen Mr. Thompson. I have met Mrs. Thompson on several
occasions since and always by appointment. They were verbal appointments. On
MondaylastImetherbyappointmentat12.30atAldersgateStreet.Wewenttolunch
at the Queen Anne’s Restaurant, Cheapside. After lunch she returned to business
and I have not seen her since. Mr. Thompson was not aware of all our meetings, but
some of them he was. I have known for a very long time past that she had led a very
unhappy life with him. This is also known to members of Mrs. Thompson’s family. I
have written to her on two occasions. I signed the letters Freddie and I addressed her
as “Dear Edie.” On the evening of Monday, 2nd October, I called on Mrs. Graydon
and stayed there till about 10 o’clock. I never mentioned the fact that I had lunched
with Mrs. Thompson that day, and as far as I know Mr. Thompson was not aware
of it. I left my home yesterday morning about a quarter to twelve. I was dressed
in the same clothes that I am now wearing. I went up West and remained there
until the evening. I was alone and never met anyone that I knew. I then went to
Mrs. Graydon’s, arriving there about 7. I left about 11 o’clock, my impression is that
it had gone 11. Before leaving I remember Mrs. Graydon’s daughter Avis saying that
Percy (Mr. Thompson) had ‘phoned her up, and I gathered from the observations
she made that he was taking his wife to a theatre that night and that there was
other members of the family going. When I left the house I went through Browning
Road, into Sibley Grove, to East Ham Railway Station. I booked to Victoria which
is my usual custom. I caught a train at 11.30 p.m. and I arrived at Victoria about
12.30 a.m. I then discovered that the last train to Gypsy Hill had gone; it leaves at
12.10 a.m. I had a few pounds in money with me but I decided to walk. I went by
way of Vauxhall Road, and Vauxhall Bridge, Kensington, Brixton, turning to the
left into Dulwich, and then on to the Crystal Palace, and from there to my address
at Upper Norwood, arriving there about 3 a.m. I never noticed either ’bus or tram
going in my direction. On arriving home I let myself in with a latchkey and went
straight to my bedroom. My mother called out to me. She said. “Is that you, Mick?”

I replied, “Yes,” and then went to bed. I got up about 9 a.m. and about 12 I left
home with my mother. I left my mother in Paternoster Row about half past two. I
stayed in the City till about 5. I then went by train from Mark Lane to East Ham,
and from there went on to Mrs. Graydon’s, arriving there about six. The ﬁrst time
that I learned that Mr. Thompson had been killed was when I bought a newspaper
in Mark Lane before I got into the train to go to East Ham. I am never in the habit of
carrying a knife. In fact I have never had one. I never met a single person that I knew
from the time that I left Mrs. Graydon’s house until I arrived home. Mrs. Thompson
has written to me two or three times. I might have received one letter from her at
home. The others I have received on board ship. I have destroyed these letters. She
used to address me as “Dear Freddie,” and signed herself “Peidi.” I occupy the back
bedroom on the top ﬂoor at my address, and that is where I keep all my clothing.
When I said that I was dressed in precisely the same clothing yesterday as I am
to-day, I meant it to include my undergarments, with the exception of my collar
and handkerchief, which are at home.
This statement has been read over to me, is voluntary and is true.
(Sgd.) Frederick E. F. Bywaters
Examination of Richard Sellars, Continued
Having made some further inquiries, I again saw Bywaters on the evening of 5th
October, and said to him, “I am going to charge you and Mrs. Thompson with the
wilful murder of Percy Thompson.” He said, “Why her? Mrs. Thompson was not
aware of my movements.” I said, “If you wish to say anything, I will take it down
in writing.” I again cautioned him. He made a statement, which I read to him, and
which he signed. It is exhibit No. 6, and it is dated 5th October –
Statement of Frederick Bywaters
Frederick Bywaters states –
I wish to make a voluntary statement. Mrs. Edith Thompson was not aware of
my movements on Tuesday night, 3rd October. I left Manor Park at 11 p.m. and
proceeded to Ilford. I waited for Mrs. Thompson and her husband. When near
Endsleigh Gardens I pushed her to one side, also pushing him further up the street.
I said to him, “You have got to separate from your wife.” He said, “No.” I said,
“You will have to.” We struggled. I took my knife from my pocket and we fought
and he got the worst of it. Mrs. Thompson must have been spellbound for I saw
nothing of her during the ﬁght. I ran away through Endsleigh Gardens, through
Wanstead, Leytonstone, Stratford; got a taxi at Stratford to Aldgate, walked from
there to Fenchurch Street, got another taxi to Thornton Heath. Then walked to
Upper Norwood, arriving home about 3 a.m. The reason I fought with Thompson
was because he never acted like a man to his wife. He always seemed several degrees
lower than a snake. I loved her and I could not go on seeing her leading that life. I
did not intend to kill him. I only meant to injure him. I gave him an opportunity
of standing up to me as a man but he wouldn’t. I have had the knife some time; it

was a sheath knife. I threw it down a drain when I was running through Endsleigh
Gardens.
Examination of Richard Sellars, Continued
Later the two prisoners were charged with the murder of Percy Thompson. When
the charge was made Thompson made no reply, while Bywaters said, “It is wrong,
it is wrong.” On 12th October I received a ditty box (exhibit No. 8), from Sergeant
James.TheprisonerBywatersgavemethekeywhichopenedthebox.Ireceivedfrom
Inspector Page, of New Scotland Yard, and also from Sergeant Hancock a number
of letters. Inspector Hall also handed to me three letters written by Bywaters. I have
seen Bywaters write, and to the best of my belief exhibits Nos. 14, 30, and 31 are in
his handwriting.
Cross-examined by Mr. Cecil Whiteley – Bywaters was taken to the Ilford
police station on the evening of 4th October.
Were you in sole charge of this case, or was there any other ofﬁcer concerned? –
Superintendent Wensley came down, but I was practically in sole charge of it. He
was not present with me at every interview I had with Bywaters. He was present
with me when Bywaters gave the long statement (exhibit No. 5). He was not present
when I took the statement No. 6. When Bywaters was brought to the station in the
evening of the 4th Superintendent Wensley and I were there, and we both saw him.
We were in the company of Bywaters that evening for about an hour and a half.
Practically the whole of that period was occupied by the taking of the statement.
There was a typist present in the room.
You do not suggest that this was a statement dictated by Bywaters? – Practically.
He wished to make a statement, and I said we would take it down in writing.
No questions asked? – Yes.
Is it not clear from the statement itself that questions were put to him and
his answers are incorporated in that statement? – Not wholly, practically. Both
Superintendent Wensley and I asked the questions. We left Bywaters about nine
o’clock. I do not think either of us saw him again that evening; I do not remember
seeinghim.Ibelievehesleptinthelibrarythatevening.Onthenextday,5thOctober,
about 3 p.m., I took a statement from Mrs. Thompson (exhibit No. 3). The second
statement of Mrs. Thompson (exhibit No. 4) was taken about half-past four or
quarter to ﬁve.
Was it before those two statements that Mrs. Thompson saw Bywaters and said,
“Why did he do it; I did not want him to do it”? – Yes, after she was returning from
the room where she was taken. Superintendent Wensley was not present when she
said that. No steps were taken by the police to prevent Mrs. Thompson and Bywaters
seeing each other.
It was after Mrs. Thompson had seen Bywaters, and after she had made the
statement (exhibit No. 4) that you went back into Bywaters’ room and the statement
(exhibit No. 6) was taken? – Yes. I wrote it down myself. Before that statement was
taken I told him that I was going to charge him and Mrs. Thompson with this crime.

By Mr. Justice Shearman – Did you know by that time that he had seen
that she was there too? – Yes.
You told us that she caught sight of him, but nobody has told us that he caught
sight of her. Do you know if he did? – I could not say, because my attention was
centred on her.
Cross-examination continued – I certainly think that Bywaters did see Mrs.
Thompson, but I cannot say positively.
No doubt they had seen one another, and the very ﬁrst thing he said, directly you
said that both of them were going to be charged, was, “Why her? Mrs. Thompson
was not aware of my movements”? – Yes.
And when you charged them both together that evening Bywaters said, “It is
wrong; it is wrong”? – Yes.
Cross-examined by Sir H. Curtis Bennett – I ﬁrst of all saw Mrs. Thompson
at11a.m.on4thOctober,themorningthatMr.Thompsondied,andatthattimeshe
madeastatementwhichInotedinmynotebook.Atthattimeshehadnoknowledge,
as far as I know, that any inquiries were being made as regards Bywaters. She did not
say anything about anybody having knocked her or pushed her aside. After making
that statement I asked her to come to the police ofﬁce, and she was kept there from
twelve o’clock on the 4th until the afternoon of the 5th, when I took from her the
long statement (exhibit No. 3).
At that time, as far as you know, she had no knowledge that Bywaters was at the
station? – I could not say, but I should not think so.
Nobody had told her as far as you know? – No, but I gleaned that she did on
account of the letters.
What? – I gleaned that she did on account of the letters. The letters were on
the table where we took the statement, and she must have known on account of
Bywaters’s letters.
By Mr. Justice Shearman – She identiﬁed her own letters to Bywaters.
Cross-examination continued – She identiﬁed them in the statement (exhibit
No. 3). That statement took about an hour and a half. After the statement was taken
she had to pass the room where Bywaters was being detained in order to get to the
matron’s room.
Directly she saw Bywaters there she said this, “Oh, God, oh, God, what can I
do? Why did he do it? I did not want him to do it”; and then almost immediately
afterwards, “I must tell the truth”? – Yes.
And then it was that, having said “I must tell the truth,” you cautioned her,
and then she said, “When we got near Endsleigh Gardens a man rushed out from
the gardens and knocked me away, pushed me away, from my husband. When I
recovered I saw my husband scufﬂing with a man. The man, who I knew as Freddie
Bywaters, was running away. He was wearing a blue overcoat and a grey hat. I knew
it was him, although I did not see his face.” That is right? – Correct.
So that directly she had in fact seen Bywaters was at the station she made this
second statement? – Yes.

Analysis of Evidence
Examination of Leonard Williams
Leonard Williams, examined by Mr. Roland Oliver – I am a detective of
K Division. On 6th October I took the prisoner Bywaters and certain property from
Ilford to Stratford Police Court. When at the Court he said, pointing to the property,
“Have you a knife there?” I said, “No.” He said, “Have they found it?” I said, “I do
not think so.” He said, “I told them I ran up Endsleigh Gardens, but coming to
think of it after I did it I ran forward along Belgrave Road towards Wanstead Park,
turning up a road to the right. I am not sure whether it was Kensington Gardens
where they lived or the next road. I then crossed over to the left side of the road, and
just before I got to the top of Cranbrook Road end I put the knife down a drain; it
should be easily found.”
Concluding Remarks
The Solicitor General – That will be the case for the Crown.
[The letters, exhibits Nos. 49, 12, 62, 27, 13, 15, 16, 20, 50, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 51,
23, 66, 67, 68, 24, 53, 25, 69, 26, 52, 63, 54, 28, 55, 47, 48, 58, 59, 9, 60, 10, 64, 14,
30, 31, were read.]
Sir H. Curtis Bennett – The jury, of course, will understand that in addition
to those letters there are 33 other ones on which the prosecution do not rely and
which are not put in.
[At the conclusion of the case for the Crown, a selection of Edith Thompson’s
letters to Bywaters and three letters from him to Thompson were read out in open
court by Travers Humphreys, one of the junior counsel for the Crown. It is said that
his reading of the letters was “not unsympathetic.”]

only and I feel scared to death in case anybody else should read them. All the wishes
I can possibly send for the very best of luck to-day,
From Peidi.

Have told you before I put 10/- eh way on ‘Welsh Woman’ for the M’chester Cup,
just because you liked it. I expect you know the result. The favourite won and it (the
favourite) was the only horse I really fancied, but as it was only 5 to 2 starting price,
I didn’t think it was worth the risk and then the dashed thing won.
Darlint, its a good job you are winning some money at cards, for I can’t win any
at horses.
I have won 14/9 on one race since you have been gone, I’ve forgotten which one
it was.
I’ve enclosed you several cuttings, please read them darlint, and tell me what you
think of them. The one I’ve marked with a cross I think very true indeed, but I’d
like to know what you think about it.
The part about ‘a man to lean on’ is especially true. Darlint, it was that about you
that ﬁrst made me think of you, in the way I do now. I feel always that were I in any
difﬁculty, I could rely and lean on you. I like to feel that I have you to lean on, of
courseIdontwanttoreallybutitsnicetoknowIcan,ifIwantto.Doyouunderstand?
Note the part, ‘always think of her ﬁrst, always be patient and kind, always help her
in every way he can, he will have gone a long way to making her love him.’
Such things as wiping up, getting pins for me etc, all counted, darlint. Do you
remember the pin incident, on Aug. 1, darlint and the subsequent remark from
him ‘You like to have someone always tacked on to you to run all your little errands
and obey all your little requests.’ That was it, darlint, that counted, obeying little
requests – such as getting a pin, it was a novelty – he’d never done that . . .
‘It is the man who has no right, who generally comforts the woman who has
wrongs.’ This is also right darlint isn’t it? as things are, but darlint, its not always
going to be is it? You will have the right soon wont you? Say Yes. . .
The last 2 Fridays I have been to the Waldorf and on the ﬁrst occasion it was
very foggy – all the trains were late, so had a taxi right to the avenue and got to
Mother’s at 10.20. He wasnt coming for me so I didnt matter much – but I expect
they wonder what I do. I have promised to go to the ‘Cafe Marguerite’ to dinner
tonight. Can you guess with whom? God knows why I said Id go, I dont want to a bit
especially with him, but it will help to pass some time away, it goes slowly enough
in all conscience – I dont seem to care who spends the money, as long as it helps me
to dance through the hours. I had the wrong Porridge today, but I dont suppose it
will matter, I dont seem to care much either way. You’ll probably say I’m careless
and I admit I am, but I dont care – do you? I gave way this week (to him I mean,) its
the ﬁrst time since you have been gone. Why do I tell you this? I dont really know
myself, I didnt when you were away before, but it seems different this time, then

I was looking forward – but now well I can only go from day to day and week to
week until Jan. 7th – then thoughts and all things stop. How have you got on with
‘The Guarded Flame.’ I expect by now you have it interesting –. I have persevered
with ‘Felix’ and have nearly ﬁnished it. Its weird – horrible and ﬁlthy – yet I am
very interested. You’ll have to read it after I have ﬁnished. I believe if I read this
letter through before I sealed it you’d not receive it darlint, I feel that Id tear it up,
it doesn’t seem to me that Ive been talking to you at all – just writing to you, but I
feel like that today, and I know its rotten because you get this letter for Xmas and it
wont be a very nice present will it darlint, but its the best I can do. Perhaps I’ll leave
this letter open and see how I feel by Wednesday, the last day for posting it.
Darlint, Monday – I recd greetings from you and a note ‘I cant write to you’ and
Ive been expecting to talk to you for a long time I wanted to I wanted you to cheer
me up – I feel awful – but I know darlint if you cant well you cant – that’s all to be
said about it, but I always feel I cant talk to you when I start, but I just say to myself
he’s here with me, looking at me and listening to what I am saying and it seems to
help darlint, couldnt you try and do this, I feel awfully sad and lonely and think how
much you would be cheering me up but perhaps you’ll think I’m selﬁsh about it all
and I suppose I am, but remember when you are thinking badly or hardly of me
your letters are the only thing I have in the world and darlint, I havnt even all those.
We had – was it a row – anyway a very heated argument again last night (Sunday).
It started through the usual source, I resisted – and he wanted to know why since
you went in August I was different – ‘had I transferred my affections from him
to you.’ Darlint it’s a great temptation to say ‘Yes’ but I did not. He said we were
cunning, the pair of us and lots of other things that I forget, also that I told lies
about not knowing you were coming on that Sat. He said ‘Has he written to you
since he has been away,’ and when I said ‘No’ he said ‘That’s another lie.’ Of course
he cant know for certain, but he surmises you do and Im afraid he’ll ring up and ask
them to stop anything that comes for me so I must get Jim on my side. You know
darlint I am beginning to think I have gone wrong in the way I manage this affair.
I think perhaps it would have been better had I acquiesced in everything he said
and did or wanted to do. At least it would have disarmed any suspicion he might
have and that would have been better if we have to use drastic measures darlint –
understand? Anyway so much for him. I’ll talk about someone else . . .
Goodbye for now darlint, I’ll try and be more cheerful when I write to Marseilles.
You say ‘Dont worry’– just dance – If I only could.
PEIDI.

darlint, I love them and don’t take any notice of me, I know I am selﬁsh – and you
ought to know by now, I told you haven’t I ? heaps of times. Now what have I got
to talk to you about, heaps of things I believe – but the most important thing is,
that I love you and am feeling so happy that you are coming back to England, even
tho perhaps I am not going to see you – you know best about that darlint, and I am
going to leave everything to you – only I would like to help you, can’t I. Of course
he knows you are due in on the 7th and will be very suspicious of me from then,
so I suppose I won’t be able to see you – will I? You know darlint, don’t have the
slightest worrying thoughts about letters as “to be careful I’ve been cruel” to myself
I mean.
Immediately I have received a second letter, I have destroyed the ﬁrst and when I
got the third I destroyed the second and so on, now the only one I have is the “Dear
Edie” one written to 41, which I am going to keep. It may be useful, who knows?
By the way I had a New Year’s card, addressed to me only from “Osborne House,
Shanklin.”
About the 15th darlint, which will be the 14th as that is the Sat: I am going – as
far as I know, I have to book the seats this week.
Darlint, I’ve surrendered to him unconditionally now – do you understand me?
I think it the best way to disarm any suspicion, in fact he has several times asked me
if I am happy now and I’ve said “Yes quite” but you know that’s not the truth, dont
you.
About the photos darlint, I have not seen them, so I don’t understand about
“waiting for you” please destroy all you don’t want and when you come to England,
show me what I look like, will you yes, I was glad you promised for me, darlint,
as I most certainly should have refused myself and I should have hated myself for
refusing all the time. Darlint, I never want to refuse you anything, its lovely for me
to feel like that about you, I think by this you can understand how much I love you.
The French phrase darlint, if I can remember rightly was “I cant wait so long, I
want time to go faster.”
You used iron and I used my heel and its such a long time ago, or seems so, since
I asked a question, to which your “I did that” is the answer, that, I have forgotten
what my question was. Yes, darlint I did wonder about you and the “Cale” and was
nursing all to myself quite an aggrieved feeling against you for not telling me, but
your letter explained. I feel glad you didn’t transfer, darlint Ive got no special reason
for feeling glad – but I am. About the fortune teller – you have never mentioned
“March” before darlint, you’ve said “Early in the New Year,” are you gradually sliding

I know I am right? Darlint, I didnt think it fair about the ﬁght altho most
people are disgusted with boxing (women I mean) I always tried to look upon it as
something strong and big and when you told me about that I thought. If amateurs
even do that sort of thing, then professionals must and I felt disappointed.
Thanking you for those greetings darlint, but you wont always be “The man with
no right” will you – tell me you wont – shout at me – make me hear and believe
darlint, about that “Do you” I believe I felt about the worst I have ever felt when that
happened I think when I noticed what I had done I had a conscience prick and felt
“I dont care what happens and I dont suppose he does really” but you would care
wouldnt you darlint? tell me yes, if I really thought you wouldnt darlint I shouldnt
want to die, I just want to go mad.
Why have you never told me what you thought of your own photos darlint, you
are a bad bad correspondent really darlint I absolutely refuse to talk to you at all
next trip, if you dont mend your ways. Darlint, are you frightened at this – just
laugh at me. . .

Darlint – You must do something this time – I’m not really impatient – but oppor-
tunities come and go by – they have to – because I’m helpless and I think and think
and think – perhaps – it will never come again.
I want to tell you about this. On Wednesday we had words – in bed – Oh you
know darlint – over that same old subject and he said – it was all through you I’d
altered.
I told him if he ever again blamed you to me for any difference there might be
in me, I’d leave the house that minute and this is not an idle threat.
He said lots of other things and I bit my lip – so that I shouldn’t answer –
eventually went to sleep. About 2 A.M. he woke me up and asked for water as he
felt ill. I got it for him and asked him what the matter was and this is what he told
me – whether its the truth I dont know or whether he did it to frighten me, anyway
it didnt. He said – someone he knows in town (not the man I previously told you
about) had given him a prescription for a draught for insomnia and he’d had it
made up and taken it and it made him ill. He certainly looked ill and his eyes were
glassy. I’ve hunted for the said prescription everywhere and cant ﬁnd it and asked
him what he had done with it and he said the chemist kept it.
I told Avis about the incident only I told her as if it frightened and worried me as
I thought perhaps it might be useful at some future time that I had told somebody.
What do you think, darlint. His sister Maggie came in last night and he told her,
so now there are two witnesses, altho’ I wish he hadn’t told her – but left me to do it.
It would be so easy darlint – if I had things – I do hope I shall.
How about cigarettes?

Analysis of Evidence
Have enclosed cuttings of Dr. Wallis’s case. It might prove interesting darlint, I
want to have you only I love you so much try and help me PEIDI.
Exhibit 15a:
Extract from Daily Sketch, 9th February, 1922, page 2, column 1.
With headnote: –
“Curate’s Household of Three.
“Mystery of his Death still unsolved.
“Wife and Doctor.
“Woman asked to leave the Court during man’s evidence.”
“Death from hyoscine poisoning, but how it was administered there is not suf-
ﬁcient evidence to show.”
This was the verdict last night at an inquest at Lingﬁeld after remarkable evidence
and searching cross-examination.
The three principal ﬁgures in the case are –
TheRev.HoraceGeorgeBolding(39),curateofLingﬁeld(Surrey)ParishChurch,
found dead on his bed in his dressing-gown on January 4. Described by parishioners
as “Happy, jovial, one of the best of good fellows, and a regular sport.”
Mrs. Bolding, about 35, the widow, who was in London with the only child, a
boy, at the time of her husband’s death.
Dr. Preston Wallis, a ship’s surgeon, who, separated from his wife, had stayed
some time with the Boldings, and who was called to the bedroom and found the
curate dead.
On page 15, column 3, the report is concluded with the following headnote: –
“Helping the Doctor.
“Why Curate’s wife often went about in his Chair.
“Practice that dwindled.”

I think I’ll tell you about the holidays darlint – just what I did – do you want to
know? or will you say its all ordinary common place talk – I suppose it is – but after I
have discussed the ordinary things, I may be able to really talk to you. On Thursday
we left at 1 and I went to the Waldorf to lunch and stayed on until the dance tea – I
only danced once – a fox trot – I don’t feel a bit like dancing darlint – I think I must
be waiting for you. We left the Waldorf at 6.20 and met Avis at 6.30 and went with
her to buy a costume – getting home about 9.
On Friday I worked hard all day starting that “Good Old fashioned English
housewife’s occupation of spring cleaning,” not because I liked doing it – or believe

in it, but because I had nothing else to do and it helped to pass the time away. I
started about 9.30 and went to wash and dress about 20 to 6 – .
Dad took us to the E.H. Palace to the Sunday League Concert in the evening and
we stopped the night at 231.
In return for this I booked for us all at Ilford Hippodrome on Saturday. The
show was good and a girl – in nurses uniform appearing with Tom Edwards sang
“He makes me all fussed up.”
Of course Avis remarked about you and the song also Molly was sitting behind
us with another girl and a boy – is she affected in her conversation? She was very
much on Saturday and I wondered if it was put on for my special beneﬁt.
Avis came back to stay the rest of the holiday with us. Bye the way, we, (she and
I) had a cup of tea in bed on Sunday – we always do when she is stopping with us.
Mother and Dad came over to me to dinner – I had plenty to do. On Monday Mr.
and Mrs. Birnage came to tea and we all went to the Hippodrome in the evening.
Bye the way – what is “Aromatic Tincture of Opium” – Avis drew my attention to a
bottle of this sealed in the medicine chest in your room.4
I took possession of it and when he missed it and asked me for it – I refused to
give it him – he refuses to tell me where he got it and for what reason he wants it –
so I shall keep it till I hear from you.
I used the “light bulb” three times but the third time – he found a piece – so I’ve
given it up – until you come home.
Do you remember asking me to get a duplicate of something – . I have done so
now.
On Sunday we were arguing about the price of “Cuticura.” Avis is quite certain
when she bought it, not for herself, (her owns words) it was 10 1/2. Mother said
when she bought it for you it was 1/- and I said the same.
The remark was passed – “you all in turn seemed to have bought it for him.”. . .

Darlingest Boy I know,
If you were to hear me talk now you would laugh, I’m quite positive and I should
be angry – I’ve got practically no voice at all – just a little very high up, squeak.
It started with a very sore throat and then my voice went – it doesn’t hurt now –
the throat is better but it sounds so funny. I feel like laughing myself but altho you’d
laugh darlint you’d be very kind wouldn’t you? and just take care of me. I know you
would without asking or you answering – but you can answer because I like to hear
you say it.
About those fainting ﬁts darlint, I don’t really know what to say to you.

Analysis of Evidence
I’m beginning to think it’s the same as before – they always happen 1st thing in
the morning – when I’m getting up and I wasn’t ill as I should have been last time,
altho’ I was a little – but not as usual.
What shall I do about it darlint, if it is the same this month – please write and
tell me I want to do just what you would like.
I still have the herbs.
“I like her she doesn’t swear.”
This is what you write – do you like her because she doesn’t swear or was that
bit an afterthought. I’m wondering what you really think of a girl – any girl – even
me who says – damn and a few stronger words sometimes – or don’t these words
constitute swearing as you hear it.
Of course I was glad you did as you did with her. I should never be glad at any
other way darlint, whatever the object or the end in view.
Talking about “Felix” darlint can’t say I was disappointed in the end because I
didn’t expect very much of him. You say you expected him to do a lot for Valevia –
I didn’t – he was too ordinary – too prosaic to do anything sensational – he’d do
anything in the world for her if it hadn’t caused comment but when it did – he
ﬁnished. Do you remember the railway station scene when her husband appeared,
and took command of the proceedings. Felix was nowhere and he allowed himself
not only to go home, but to be ordered to go home by Mr. Ismay. What were your
feelings for Mr. Ismay – did you like him? About the word you starred – I can’t say
I actually know the meaning of the word only of course I guess but you can tell me
darlint I certainly shan’t ask anyone else.
Darlint isn’t this a mistake “Je suis gache, ma pauvre petite amie.” This is how
you wrote it.
I was glad you think and feel the same way as I do about the “New Forest.” I
don’t think we’re failures in other things and we musn’t be in this. We musn’t give
up as we said. No, we shall have to wait if we fail again. Darlint, Fate can’t always
turn against us and if it is we must ﬁght it – You and I are strong now We must be
stronger. We must learn to be patient. We must have each other darlint. Its meant
to be I know I feel it is because I love you such a lot – such a love was not meant to
be in vain. It will come right I know one day, if not by our efforts some other way.
We’ll wait eh darlint, and you’ll try and get some money and then we can go away
and not worry about anybody or anything. You said it was enough for an elephant.
Perhaps it was. But you don’t allow for the taste making only a small quantity to be
taken. It sounded like a reproach was it meant to be?
Darlint I tried hard – you won’t know how hard – because you weren’t there
to see and I can’t tell you all – but I did – I do want you to believe I did for both
of us.
You will see by my last letter to you I havn’t forgotten the key and I didn’t want
reminding – I didn’t forget that – altho’ I did forget something last time didn’t I
altho it was only small.

We have changed our plans about Llandudno – it is too expensive we are going
to Bournemouth July 8th, and while Avis was over last night he asked her to come
with us. The suggestion was nothing to do with me – it was his entirely and altho’
I wouldn’t have suggested such a thing for the world – I’m glad – because if things
are still the same and we do go – a third party helps to make you forget that you
always lead the existence we do.
Au revoir for the week end darlint.
The mail was in this morning and I read your letter darlint, I cried – I couldn’t
help it – such a lot it sounded so sad I cried for you I could exactly feel how you
were feeling – I’ve felt like that so often and I know.
I was buoyed up with the hope of the “light bulb” and I used a lot – big pieces
too – not powdered – and it has no effect – I quite expected to be able to send that
cable – but no – nothing has happened from it and now your letter tells me about
the bitter taste again. Oh darlint, I do feel so down and unhappy.
Wouldn’t the stuff make small pills coated together with soap and dipped in
liquorice powder – like Beechams – try while you’re away. Our Boy had to have his
thumb operated on because he had a piece of glass in it that’s what made me try
that method again – but I suppose as you say he is not normal, I know I feel I shall
never get him to take a sufﬁcient quantity of anything bitter. No I haven’t forgotten
the key I told you before.
Darlint two heads are better than one is such a true saying. You tell me not to leave
ﬁnger marks on the box – do you know I did not think of the box but I did think of
the glass or cup whatever was used. I wish I wish oh I wish I could do something.
Darlint, think for me, do. I do want to help. If you only knew how helpless and
selﬁsh I feel letting you do such a lot for me and I doing nothing for you. If ever we
are lucky enough to be happy darling I’ll love you such a lot. I always show you how
much I love you for all you do for me. Its a terrible feeling darlint to want – really
want to give all and everything, and not be able to give a tiny little thing – just thro’
circumstances.
You asked me if Deborah described her feelings rightly when she was talking
about Kullett making love to her.
Darlingest, boy, I don’t think all the feelings can be put on paper because there
are not words to describe them. The feeling is one of repugnance, loathing not
only of the person but of yourself – and darlint when you think of a man and a
woman jointly wrote that book it’s not feasible that the words used would be bad
enough to express the feelings. The man Author wouldn’t allow the woman Author
to talk too badly of Kullett – do you think? I still think that nobody can express
the feelings – I’m sure I couldn’t – but they are there, deeply rooted and can never
be plucked out as circumstances now are unless they (the circumstances) change.
Did you notice any similarity in 2 girls names in two books that you recently read

and the utter dissimilarity in their natures (I don’t think I spelt that word rightly)
I didn’t know that you would be in London a month this time – altho I had a little
idea.
That month – I can’t bear to think of it a whole four weeks and things the same
as they are now. All those days to live thro for just one hour in each.
All that lying and scheming and subterfuge to obtain one little hour in each
day – when by right of nature and our love we should be together for all the 24 in
every day.
Darlint don’t let it be – I can’t bear it all this time – the pain gets too heavy to
bear – heavier each day – but if things were different what a grand life we should
start together. Perhaps we could have that one week I could be ill from shock – More
lies – but the last. Eh darlint.
Do experiment with the pills while you are away – please darlint.
No we two – two halves – have not yet come to the end of our tether.
Don’t let us.
I’m sorry I’ve had to use this piece of paper but the pad was empty – I sent the
boy for a fresh one and they will have none in until tomorrow.
We have started on the 5th week of your absence now – each week seems longer
than the last and each day the length of two.
Do you know darlint that the Saturday I usually have off when you are home is
Whit Saturday and I shan’t be able to see you nor on the Monday following.
Three whole days – and you so near and yet so far – it musn’t be darlint – we
musn’t let it somehow.
Good bye now darlint I can’t write any more. You said you have a lump – so have
I in fact its more than a lump now.
Good bye until Marseilles next week. I do always love you and think of you.

Enclosure in letter, dated 1 April 1922.
Dont keep this piece.
About the Marconigram – do you mean one saying Yes or No, because I shant
send it darlint I’m not going to try any more until you come back.
I made up my mind about this last Thursday.
He was telling his Mother etc. the circumstances of my “Sunday morning
escapade” and he puts great stress on the fact of the tea tasting bitter “as if something
had been put in it” he says. Now I think whatever else I try it in again will still taste
bitter – he will recognise it and be more suspicious still and if the quantity is still
not successful – it will injure any chance I may have of trying when you come home.
Do you understand?
I thought a lot about what you said of Dan.

Darlint, don’t trust him – I don’t mean don’t tell him anything because I know
you never would – What I mean is don’t let him be suspicious of you regarding
that – because if we were successful in the action – darlint circumstances may
afterwards make us want many friends – or helpers and we must have no enemies –

Darlingest Boy,
I’m trying very hard – very very hard to B.B. I know my pal wants me to.
On Thursday – he was on the ottoman at the foot of the bed and said he was
dying and wanted to – he had another heart attack – thro me.
Darlint I had to laugh at this because I knew it couldn’t be a heart attack.
When he saw this had no effect on me – he got up and stormed – I said exactly
what you told me to and he replied that he knew thats what I wanted and he wasnt
going to give it to me – it would make things far too easy for both of you (meaning
you and me) especially for you he said.
He said hed been to 231 and been told you had said you were taking a pal out
and it was all a planned affair so was the last Thursday you were home and also
Tuesday of last week at Fenchurch Street – he told them at 231 a pal of his saw us
and by the description he gave of the man I was with it was you.

Analysis of Evidence
That’s an awful lie darlint because I told him I went to F St. for Mr. Carlton and
saw Booth and spoke to him and I asked him the next day if Booth mentioned me
and he said no – nothing at all.
We’re both liars he says and you are making me worse and he’s going to put a
stop to all or any correspondence coming for me at 168. He said “It’s useless for
you to deny he writes to you – because I know he does” – hence my wire to you
regarding G.P.O.
He also says I told him I wrote to you asking you not to see me this time – he
knows very well I said last time – but I think he has really persuaded himself I said
this time.
I rang Avis yesterday and she said he came down there in a rage and told Dad
everything – about all the rows we have had over you – but she did not mention
he said anything about the ﬁrst real one on August 1st – so I suppose he kept that
back to suit his own ends Dad said it was a disgraceful thing that you should come
between husband and wife and I ought to be ashamed. Darlint I told you this is how
they would look at it – they don’t understand and they never will any of them.
Dad was going to talk to me Avis said – but I went down and nothing whatever
was said by any of them. I told Avis I shd tell them off if they said anything to me I
didn’t go whining to my people when he did things I didn’t approve of and I didnt
expect him to – but however nothing was said at all.
Dad said to them “What a scandal if it should get in the papers” so evidently he
suggested drastic measures to them.
On Friday night I said I was going to sleep in the little room – we had a scufﬂe –
he succeeded in getting into the little room and on to the bed – so I went into the
bathroom and stopped there for 1/2 an hr – he went downstairs then and I went into
the little room quickly – locked the door and stopped there all night – I shd have
continued to do so – but even a little thing like that Fate was against us – because
Dad was over on Sat. and asked me if he could stay the night – suggested he should
sleep with him in the big bed – but Dad would not hear of it – so sooner than make
another fuss – I gave in.
On Saturday he told me he was going to break me in somehow – I have always
had too much of my own way and he was a model husband – and in future on
Thursdays the bedroom was to be cleaned out.
He also told me he was going to be master and I was to be his mistress and not
half a dozen mens (his words) I dont exactly know how to take this – Darlint, do
you know Avis said to me – Miss M’Donald saw you with Freddy last week – of
course I denied it – but she described my frock – anyhow it turned out to be on
Wed. – so of course it was all right – but you see – we are seen and by people who
know us and cant hold their tongues Avis said she was upset because you had gone
for good – she said she could hardly realise it. She also said that he said at 231 “I
thought he was keen on you (Avis) – but now I can see it was a blind to cover his
infatuation for Edie.”
Darlint its not an infatuation is it? Tell me it isn’t.
