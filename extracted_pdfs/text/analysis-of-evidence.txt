Analysis of Evidence
This is an enjoyable and rigorous introduction to the construction and criticism
of arguments about questions of fact, and to the marshalling and evaluation of
evidence at all stages of litigation. It covers the principles underlying the logic of
proof; the uses and dangers of story-telling; standards for decision and the rela-
tionship between probabilities and proof; the chart method and other methods of
analyzing and ordering evidence in fact-investigation, in preparing for trial, and in
connection with other important decisions in legal processes and in criminal inves-
tigation and intelligence analysis. Most of the chapters in this new edition have been
rewritten; the treatment of fact investigation, probabilities and narrative has been
extended; and new examples and exercises have been added. Designed as a ﬂexible
tool for undergraduate and postgraduate courses on evidence and proof, students,
practitioners and teachers alike will ﬁnd this book challenging but rewarding.

Law in Context
The series is a vehicle for the publication of innovative scholarly books that treat law and
legal phenomena critically in their social, political and economic contexts from a variety of
perspectives. The series particularly aims to publish scholarly legal writings that bring fresh
perspectives to bear on new and existing areas of law taught in universities. A contextual
approachinvolvestreatinglegalsubjectsbroadly,usingmaterialsfromothersocialsciences,
and from any other discipline that helps to explain the operation in practice of the subject
under discussion. It is hoped that this orientation is at once more stimulating and more
realistic than the bare exposition of legal rules. The series includes original books that
have a different emphasis from traditional legal textbooks, while maintaining the same
high standards of scholarship. They are written primarily for students of law and of other
disciplines, but most also appeal to a wider readership. Recent publications include books
on globalization, transnational legal processes, and comparative law. In the past, most
authors have come from, or been based in, Europe or the Commonwealth. In the future,
wealsoexpecttopublishauthorsfrom,orbasedin,theUnitedStatesorCanada,particularly
those who adopt a clear transatlantic perspective. The books will include subject areas
that have a transnational signiﬁcance, drawing on European as well as North American
scholarship.

Preface
The why, what, and how of this book
The why
Inferential reasoning, analyzing and weighing evidence, forming judgments about
what has happened in the past or what is likely to happen in the future are a
necessary part of coping with the problems of everyday living. They are basic human
skills that form part of ordinary practical reasoning. Historians, detectives, doctors,
engineers, and intelligence analysts have to develop and apply these skills with rigor
and precision in specialized professional contexts. So do lawyers.
These skills have not traditionally formed part of professional training. Perhaps
this is because they are perceived to be “mere common sense”; or because it has been
felt that they can only be learned by practical experience “on the job”; or because
of a belief that these are matters of “intuition” or that great lawyers or historians or
detectives or diagnosticians are “born and not made.”1
This book starts from a different premise. Building on the work of the American
legal scholar John Henry Wigmore (1863–1943), we believe that skills in analyzing
and marshaling evidence and in constructing, criticizing and evaluating arguments
about disputed questions of fact are intellectual skills that can and should be taught
effectivelyandefﬁcientlyinlawschools.Theyareasessentialapartof“legalmethod”
as legal analysis and reasoning about questions of law. Common sense, intuition,
and practical experience all have a part to play in exercising these skills, but they are
not adequate substitutes for a systematic grounding in what Wigmore called “the
principles of proof.” This book is designed to enable students to lay a foundation
and to develop the basic skills to a high degree before they enter practice as lawyers
or in other spheres of activity that involve practical reasoning.
Between us we have accumulated more than ﬁfty years of experience in teaching
analysis of evidence in a variety of courses in several different countries. This book
builds on that experience. It is designed as a ﬂexible tool to lay a foundation for
mastering a necessary set of basic intellectual and professional skills in fact anal-
ysis. They include techniques for structuring a problem and organizing a mass of
data (macroscopic analysis) and techniques for detailed analysis and evaluation of

Preface
particular data and phases of complex arguments (microscopic analysis). Our main
purpose is to present a vehicle for learning certain usable basic skills of analysis,
argument, and practical problem-solving. The primary audience is law students,
especially in courses on evidence and trial practice, but the early chapters and many
of the examples can be used to learn about and develop skills of inferential reasoning
in other contexts.
The what
Chapter 1, “Evidence and inference: some food for thought,” is a series of materials,
cases, questions, and exercises. These are designed to achieve three objectives. First,
to engage the interest of students and other readers, we have included some familiar
and not so familiar examples illustrating the range of contexts in which inferential
reasoning is necessary or useful. Second, we have provided examples that introduce
concepts and issues that are developed in the remainder of the book so that readers
can actively think about them from the outset. Third, these materials include con-
crete examples and exercises that are used as the basis for explaining and illustrating
materials presented in later chapters. We have deliberately presented a wide variety
of materials so that teachers can select which examples to use to introduce the sub-
ject and which can be studied later or omitted altogether. All of these examples have
been used in the classroom, none of the authors use them all in one course, and
each has his favorites. This is not a reading chapter; rather the idea is to encourage
readers to engage actively with some concrete examples before moving on to the
more abstract material that follows. Some teachers have used selected examples
to illustrate concepts in subsequent chapters that students have been assigned to
read later. Others may choose to recommend that their students begin by reading
Chapters 2 and 3, referring back to particular examples as they appear in the text.
Chapter 2, “Fact investigation and the nature of evidence,” introduces basic
concepts and considerations that apply to evidence and inference across many
contexts, with particular reference to the generation and testing of hypotheses in the
process of any kind of factual investigation. This is illustrated vividly by the problem
of “connecting the dots” in intelligence analysis. It deals speciﬁcally with the idea of
“a substance-blind approach,” which considers the basic inferential characteristics
orcredentialsofevidence(relevance,credibility,andprobativeforce)withoutregard
to the substance or content of the evidence or to the context of the inquiry. This
classiﬁcation of evidence allows us to say general things about evidence regardless
of its substance.
Chapter 3, “Principles of proof,” develops these ideas in a legal context. It
describes the “Rationalist Tradition” that has been the foundation of Anglo-
American evidence scholarship and explains why it is relevant to contemporary
legal practice. It identiﬁes the forms of logic that must be used in analyzing evidence
or in justifying conclusions based upon evidence and demonstrates how they can
be applied to legal disputes, using the ﬁnal exercise in Chapter 1, “An investigation.”

Chapter 4, “Methods of analysis,” introduces the main methods of analysis used
in preparation for trial and their relations to each other: chronologies, the outline
method, narrative, and the chart method. It presents a general seven-step protocol
that ﬁts all of them, using the material from the O. J. Simpson case from Chapter 1
to illustrate its application. We have included this generalized account as a separate
chapter for two reasons: ﬁrst, some teachers may wish to provide an overview
of approaches without going into detail about the chart method. Second, in our
experience we have found this an effective way of easing students into the rigors of
the chart method.
Chapter 5, “The chart method,” is the heart of the book for those who wish to
master the most rigorous method of analysis. It is a substantially revised version of
the method that Wigmore developed for the analysis of mixed masses of evidence
early in the last century. It is an intellectual procedure for analyzing and organizing
a complex body of evidential data and demonstrating precisely how the inferences
from that data can be marshaled in support of and in opposition to the ultimate
proposition that must be proved. It also makes it possible to subject selected phases
of a complex argument to rigorous microscopic analysis. Such analysis can be used
to identify and construct arguments about whether evidence should be admitted or
its use restricted, as well as to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the particular
phase of the argument based upon that data. Each step of the method is illustrated
using United States v. Able and the O. J. Simpson example from Chapter 1.
Chapter 6, “Outline, chronologies, and narratives,” considers other methods
of analysis in the context of litigation. The outline method is a familiar device.
Variations of it are common. It is, on its face, less difﬁcult to grasp and easier to use
than the chart method. Chronologies and narratives are other devices commonly
usedinpracticetoorganizetheavailableevidenceandtodevelopandtestarguments
based on that evidence. Part C of that chapter, “The litigation context,” describes
which of the methods is best suited to the various stages of a case.
Chapter 7 uses an edited version of the record of R. v. Bywaters and Thompson
to illustrate how the chart method can be applied to a complex decided case. The
questions at the end have been organized to reﬂect the seven-step protocol. In
our experience, if students immerse themselves in the detail and then are guided
through the case using these questions step by step they readily grasp the basics
of Wigmorean analysis. However, other cases involving mixed masses of evidence
about which there is scope for reasoned disagreement, such as Sacco and Vanzetti,
or O. J. Simpson, or the Lindbergh Baby (Bruno Hauptman), or any other complex
case, can also be used for this purpose, provided that a detailed record is available
and there is a historical doubt about the event.
Wigmore’s presentation of the principles of reasoning and methods of analysis
falls squarely within the mainstream of Anglo-American scholarship, but he did not
satisfactorilyaddressaclassofproblemsthatareimportantforlawyersandthathave
emerged in recent debates as central issues for scholars. How is the strength of an
inference to be determined? How is the net persuasive value of a mass of evidence

to be assessed? How are judgments about the probative force of different items
of evidence to be combined? How can the lawyer (or the trier of fact) determine
whether a mass of evidence, which logically supports the truth of the proposition
ultimately to be proved, satisﬁes the applicable standard of proof? What do we mean
when we say a proposition has been proven to be “more probable than not,” proven
by “clear and convincing evidence,” or proven “beyond a reasonable doubt”? We
confront these problems in Chapters 8 and 9.
Chapter 8, “Evaluating evidence,” ﬁrst presents the traditional vocabularies that
lawyers and others use in arguing about these issues in court. The next part,
“Standards for decision,” introduces the distinction between standards intended
to guide the decision-makers’ exercise of discretion, such as the standards deﬁn-
ing the burden of proof, and standards designed to deﬁne the limits of discretion,
such as the standards that appellate courts apply in deciding whether the decision
below exceeded those limits. That part moves beyond the familiar standards of
proof to consider standards for other decisions that are involved in the total process
of litigation from the ﬁrst interview of a client to pre-trial decisions, through the
trial process and beyond, including standards for lawyers’ decisions, decisions to
prosecute, and other standards for decision in litigation and adjudication.
Chapter9,“Probabilities,weight,andprobativeforce,”providesabasicintroduc-
tion to probability theory. It outlines the debates about the application of different
theories of probability in legal contexts and elucidates some basic concepts. These
debates mainly focus upon whether probability theory should be used in evaluating
evidence for cases-as-a-whole – i.e. arguments to a judge or jury. As a practical
matter, practitioners, judges, and most legal academics have rejected the use of
Bayes’s Theorem and other axioms of probability for these purposes, but have rec-
ognized that they should play a role in speciﬁc contexts – for example, in paternity
suits, or disparate impact cases, as the basis for many scientiﬁc or expert opinions,
or in wrongful death or total disability cases. There are further reasons why lawyers
should be familiar with these concepts. Probability assessments have an important
role as an aid to making many pre-trial decisions. The decision to prosecute or
to contest a case requires analysis of the probability that liability or guilt will be
established and, in a civil case, an estimate of the probable quantum of damages.
Negotiations to settle a case or to reach a plea agreement are often argued in terms
of probability assessments made by each of the parties.2 Lawyers also need to be
equipped to recognize fallacies and misuses of statistics that may be made by their
opponents.
Chapter 9 provides the theoretical background to the separate appendix on
Probabilities and Proof by Philip Dawid, which is included on the website for this
book.3 Theappendixisabasicpracticalintroductiontostatisticalmethodappliedto

legal examples. It explores the theoretical and practical problems posed by the use of
mathematical probabilities in evaluating evidence. It introduces some basic axioms
of probabilistic analysis and, through a series of problems and exercises, illustrates
their application in contexts such as DNA, paternity suits, discrimination cases, and
actuarial analysis.
Chapter 10, “Necessary but dangerous,” explores at greater length the roles of
generalizations and stories in argumentation about questions of fact and the rela-
tions between them. This is mainly a theoretical chapter, but it includes two simple
protocols that a lawyer might use in testing key generalizations or potential stories
in preparing for trial.
Chapter 11, “The principles of proof and the law of evidence,” explores the
intimate relationship between the principles of proof and the law of evidence,
recapping on points where the connections have been touched on previously, espe-
cially in relation to basic concepts and exploring these in more detail in relation to
hearsay.
Chapter 12, “The trial lawyer’s standpoint,” integrates the materials and methods
introduced in Chapters 2 to 11 into the practical context of preparation for trial.
This chapter includes two simple trafﬁc cases that have been adapted from exercises
used at the Inns of Court School of Law in London and two more complex problems
drawn from the oldest National Trial Competition in the United States. We have
found that these cases work well either as a basis for class discussion or as problems
for simulated mini-trials on either side of the Atlantic.
Changes in this edition
First, David Schum has joined us as a co-author. Trained in probability and psy-
chology, he has in recent years been concerned with evidence as a multi-disciplinary
subject. In Evidential Foundations of Probabilistic Reasoning (1994) he argued that
other disciplines had a lot to learn about evidence from law, but that lawyers could
also beneﬁt by considering those features of evidence that cross all or most dis-
ciplines. This “substance-blind” approach to relevance, credibility, and probative
force is introduced in Chapter 2, with particular reference to investigation and
inquiry in both legal and non-legal contexts.
Second, scientiﬁc evidence, such as DNA, and the bearing of probability theory
and practical statistics on evidence in legal contexts have increased in importance
in recent years. Chapter 9 contains a brief introduction to probability theory; the
Appendix provides a practical introduction to the application of statistical methods
to legal issues as an optional extra. Placing this on the website has made it possible
to shorten the hard copy of the book, while substantially expanding the treatment
of statistics.
Third, Wigmorean analysis has become much better known outside legal circles
as well as within law. Specialists in decision theory, artiﬁcial intelligence, and in
other areas have taken great interest in assisting intelligence analysts in “connecting

Preface
the dots” or trying to make sense out of masses of evidence. Wigmore’s methods
are now being routinely applied in such efforts. They have also been applied to
investigation of multiple crimes and insurance fraud (Schum (1987), Leary (2003),
Twining (2003)). We have expanded the scope of this edition to take account of
such developments, especially in relation to intelligence analysis post 9/11.
Fourth, there have been many developments in the law of evidence, civil and
criminal procedure, and in scientiﬁc evidence.4 Evidence scholarship has continued
to be a lively and pluralistic ﬁeld. It is now a well-established area in comparative
law. Evidence is becoming increasingly recognized as an exciting multidisciplinary
subject of great importance in many spheres of practical activity (Schum (1994);
Twining and Hampsher-Monk (2003); Twining (2003)). The ﬁrst edition did not
deal in detail with how the principles of proof and the law of evidence interact. We
have added Chapter 11 in order to make this relationship clear and to facilitate the
integration of the logic of proof and the rules of evidence in teaching.5
All of these developments have been taken into account in revising this edition.
However, the principles of inferential reasoning, the basic concepts, and the skills
involved in analyzing and marshaling mixed masses of evidence are quite stable. We
have retained examples that we have found work well in teaching, even though some
of them are quite old. We have dropped others and streamlined the presentation.
We have tried to make the book more ﬂexible and accessible to a variety of users,
by giving clearer signposts.
Throughout this period the authors have continued to think, write, and teach
in this area. Our ideas have continued to develop and we have learned from the
experience of using the ﬁrst edition in teaching and from the critical feedback of
hundreds of students and some colleagues. Almost all our students have found
the process of learning the method challenging and hard work (the motto of our
courses has been “tough, but fun”); nevertheless, the vast majority have succeeded
in mastering the basic techniques and many have produced work of outstanding
quality. Interestingly, the subject has worked best with ﬁrst year law students in
Miami, where it is a popular elective in the second semester. Many of our students
have reported that they have found the approach very helpful in practice, some
claimingthatitwasthemostusefulcoursethattheyhadinlawschool.Ofcourse,they
4 For England these developments are surveyed in Zander (2003), Dennis (2004), and Roberts and
Zuckerman (2004).
5 Throughout this edition we indicate important points of contact between the principles of proof
and the law of evidence. For this purpose, we have used the Federal Rules of Evidence (as amended
up to Dec. 1, 2002). This is a coherent, accessible, and important code that falls four-square within
the Rationalist Tradition. In respect of English law we make regular reference to Ian Dennis, The
Law of Evidence (2nd edn, 2002), especially Chs. 1–4, which is generally in tune with our approach.
So is Roberts and Zuckerman, Criminal Evidence (2004). Michael Zander’s Cases and Materials
on the English Legal System (9th edn, 2003) contains useful discussions of debates and reforms
concerning evidence and procedure in recent years. The main points of direct connection between
the principles of proof and the law of evidence concern matters such as the basic concepts, relevance,
standards of proof, and judicial notice, topics in respect of which there are not great differences
between common law jurisdictions.

do not spend time drawing elaborate charts in straightforward cases, but the basic
techniques of evidence marshaling and argument construction can become habits
of mind that are invaluable and efﬁcient in handling both simple and complex cases.
This is hardly surprising because Wigmore’s method is essentially a systematization
of the “best practice” of good lawyers.
Most of our students and some colleagues are converts. Moreover, the type of
analysis involved in the chart method has in recent years attracted interest in a
number of ﬁelds, including police investigation, intelligence analysis, and various
other spheres of practical decision-making (Schum (1987); Leary (2003), Twining
(2003)). There are, however, still some skeptics, not least among teachers of the
law of evidence (Roberts (2002), Murphy (2001); response by Twining (2005)). We
have tried to address their central criticism that the ﬁrst edition was too substantial
and complex to use in an ordinary law of evidence course, and we hope that this
edition is more accessible and user friendly.
How to use this book
Our main purpose is to present a vehicle for learning certain usable basic skills of
analysis, argument, and practical problem-solving; hence this book can be used
as core or supplemental material in a variety of ways and in a variety of courses.
Chapter 1 contains a number of concrete examples and exercises that can be used
selectively for different purposes.
First, the book can be used as the basis for a self-standing course on analysis of
evidence.Allthreeauthorshaveuseditinthiswayforoveradecadeinapostgraduate
course in London, in ﬁrst degree courses for lawyers and non-lawyers at George
Mason University, and, most successfully, as a popular ﬁrst year elective at the
University of Miami Law School.
Second, this edition has been designed so that it can also be used as part of
orthodox evidence courses. Anderson has regularly used it during the ﬁrst three
weeks of a standard four-credit course on the Law of Evidence in Miami; Twining
teaches it as the ﬁrst third of the year-long course on Evidence and Proof in the
London LLM, the second half of which is devoted to selected topics in the Law of
Evidence, the remainder being devoted to a brief introduction to statistical analysis.
Other law teachers who have tried to introduce this approach at the start of their
courses on evidence have tended to ﬁnd the ﬁrst edition too substantial and too
dense to use in three to four weeks. With this in mind we have reorganized the book,
shortened several chapters, and indicated more clearly how the principles of proof
underpin and are integrated into evidence doctrine. We have also provided some
guidance to teachers who wish to take some short cuts in order to ﬁt this subject
into a few weeks.
We would emphasize, however, that there are no short cuts to learning
the basic skills involved. If the learning objectives include mastering the basic
techniques of evidence marshaling and the construction and criticism of rigorous

Preface
arguments about disputed questions of fact, these can only be acquired by repeated
practice involving exercises that are inevitably time consuming for students.
However, it is our experience that a student who has acquired these skills can
much more rapidly and efﬁciently understand the law of evidence and its practical
applications. In short, studying analysis of evidence takes time, but it also saves
time. In our view, the basic approach can be taught in a minimum of eight to ten
contact hours together with at least two written exercises.
Third, while the obvious and tested uses are in basic or advanced courses in
evidence and trial or pre-trial advocacy, we believe that some chapters can also
be usefully employed in any skills course that seeks to develop the intellectual
component of practical lawyering skills (and indeed in pre-law and other under-
graduate courses concerned with rigorous reasoning about disputed questions of
fact). Handling evidence is a basic human skill and a neglected aspect of “thinking
like a lawyer.” Wigmorean analysis is beginning to feature in the training of intel-
ligence analysts, police investigators, and others. It deserves to be a regular part of
the curriculum of ﬁrst degrees in law.

Evidence and inference: some food
for thought
A. Introduction
The ﬁeld of evidence is no other than the ﬁeld of knowledge. (Bentham, An Introductory
View, Chapter 1)
Evidence is the basis of justice: exclude evidence, you exclude justice. (Bentham, Ratio-
nale of Judicial Evidence, Part III, Chapter 1)
In this chapter we present some concrete examples and exercises that introduce
the main questions and the basic concepts that are involved in analyzing evidence.
The purpose of presenting them at this stage is partly to stimulate interest and
puzzlement and partly to encourage you to start to think actively about some basic
issues. We use many of the examples and exercises presented here to illustrate points
developed later in the book.
The examples in part B raise questions about the similarities and differences
involved in confronting problems of evidence and inference in different non-legal
contexts, including bible stories, intelligence analysis, famous “analysts,” and com-
monplace events. Each develops variations around the central theme that the kind
of reasoning involved in all these different kinds of factual enquiries is based on the
same underlying principles that apply differently as the contexts and standpoints
vary.
The examples in part C illustrate the same central theme using examples from
legal contexts. The ﬁrst four examples introduce the process of imaginative reason-
ing and the roles that generalizations and stories play in arguments about disputed
questions of fact. The remaining examples involve cases of increasing complexity
that focus upon the kinds of analysis required at different stages of criminal and
civil cases and raise issues about the relationship between law and fact, standards
of proof, and inferential reasoning in both kinds of cases.
This book is concerned with techniques of analysis, but a central theme is that
the logic of proof and the law of evidence are closely related and interdependent.
Sargent v Southern Accident Co. and United States v Able were originally devised as
examination questions in traditional evidence courses that had analysis of facts as
a signiﬁcant objective. Each item raises a number of interconnected issues dealing

Analysis of Evidence
with the law of evidence and problems of proof within the context of a case as a
whole. The ﬁnal exercise, “An investigation,” is intended as a vehicle for reviewing
the basic concepts and for introducing a vocabulary for discourse about analysis
and evaluation of evidence.
In our experience, all of these examples are good vehicles for use in teach-
ing and reﬂection, but it is not necessary to introduce all of them at the start of
a course. Several of the examples are used to illustrate important points in the
text (principally, the cases involving Bywaters and Thompson, Sacco and Vanzetti,
O. J. Simpson, the United States and Richard Able, Sargent and the Southern
Accident Co., and An investigation). Readers and teachers may wish to postpone
the detailed study of these until they come to the relevant topics.
B. Evidence and inference in non-legal contexts
1. Whose baby I? The judgment of Solomon
Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.
And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was
delivered of a child with her in the house. And it came to pass the third day after that I
was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no
stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. And this woman’s child died
in the night; because she overlaid it. And she arose at midnight, and took my son from
beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child
in my bosom. And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was
dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which
I did bear. And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is
thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they
spake before the king.
Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead:
and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. And the king
said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. And the king said,
Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. Then spake
the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her
son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the
other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it. Then the king answered and
said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. And all
Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for
they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment. (I Kings iii, 16–28)

(b) both women believed that Solomon would carry out his threat?
5 Does this story suggest that Solomon’s “wisdom” was founded on the notion that he
was a clever investigator; a just judge; an enlightened problem-solver; or a potentially
good poker-player?
6 There are different versions of the Bible. In the Revised Standard Edition of the Bible,
the last sentence reads: “And all Israel heard the judgment which the king had
rendered; and they stood in awe of the king, because they perceived that the wisdom
of God was in him, to render justice.” What evidence should a biblical scholar
examine to determine which version is the most accurate? What standards should she
apply? What evidence should a Justice of the United States Supreme Court examine to
determine the meaning of a clause of the Constitution of the United States? What
standards should the Justice apply?
2. The intelligence analyst: an intelligence scenario “from the top-down”
Investigations and inferences in intelligence analysis share many elements of such
tasks that are performed in other areas such as law, medicine, history, and science.
There are three disciplines in which persons performing analytic tasks must be
prepared to encounter and evaluate every imaginable substantive kind of evidence;
thesedisciplinesarelaw,intelligenceanalysis,andhistory.Establishingtherelevance,
credibility, and inferential [probative] force of evidence is just as important in
intelligence analysis as it is in law.
During fact investigation in law, as well as in intelligence investigations, hypothe-
ses are generated as explanations for what is being observed. The generation of
hypotheses requires imaginative reasoning mixed with critical reasoning. New
hypotheses are put to use in generating new lines of inquiry and potential evi-
dence. One criterion for assessing the merit of a new hypothesis concerns how well
it assists the analyst in generating new and productive lines of inquiry that would
not have been generated from other existing hypotheses. On occasion, the role of
hypothesis generation is either downplayed or overlooked entirely. In some cases,
new hypotheses come in the form of guesses about what has happened or what will
happen. According to an old saying, hypotheses are like nets; only he who casts

Analysis of Evidence
will catch. In every episode of fact investigation in law, intelligence analysis, or else-
where, analysts have evidence in search of hypotheses at the same time as they have
hypotheses in search of evidence. The following is an example from intelligence
analysis in which a hypothesis is put to use in generating new observable evidence.
The generation of a new hypothesis from observations we make is frequently
said to involve “bottom-up” reasoning; generation of new potential evidence from
a hypothesis is said to involve “top-down” reasoning. In intelligence analysis, as in
law, both forms of reasoning are necessary.
An important area of intelligence analysis is called “Indications and Warnings”
(I & W). The purpose of I & W efforts is to alert decision-makers in our government
and military organizations to the existence of possible immediate or near-term
threats that are posed by hostile or potentially hostile forces or organizations. An
obvious objective of I & W efforts today is to predict and prevent terrorist actions
such as the destruction of the World Trade Center and parts of the Pentagon that
we witnessed on September 11, 2001, during which more than 3,000 lives were lost.
Those tragedies involved the hijacked domestic airliners used essentially as ﬂying
bombs. There is concern that such a method of destruction might be used again
in the future. Unfortunately, there are other methods that terrorist organizations
might employ in their efforts to cause loss of life, destruction, and widespread terror
in our homeland.
You are a member of an I & W team. Based upon recent intelligence reports,
your agency believes that there is a signiﬁcant possibility that one or more terrorist
groups are planning to commit a major terrorist action involving a “dirty bomb.”
Dirty bombs involve radioactive, but not ﬁssionable, materials such as strontium,
cobalt-60, and cesium 137. Such devices can be set off using conventional explosives
such as TNT, Semtex, or C-4 plastic explosives. They are much less expensive to
construct and require much less technical expertise.
A dirty bomb will simply have radioactive materials packed around a core of
conventional explosives. Such devices can be triggered electronically from remote
locations. When triggered, a dirty bomb can disperse radioactive material over a
wide area. Though dirty bombs cause far less destruction and loss of life, they do
produce serious consequences in any area where they are set off. Persons in the
immediate vicinity will be subject to serious radiation and the surrounding area
will be contaminated for long periods of time. A dirty bomb would certainly cause
panic throughout any country in which it is set off.
Cesium 137 has already been employed in suspected terrorist activities. In March
1996 it was reported that certain Chechen leaders had threatened to expose the city
of Moscow to radioactive devastation. Anonymous calls directed police ofﬁcers to
a park in Moscow where they would ﬁnd a container of powdered cesium 137.
Just a few ounces of this material could contaminate an entire city for decades.
It is estimated that just one ounce of powdered cesium 137 released by a dirty
bomb could spread radioactive fallout over 60 city blocks. Radioactive materials
such as strontium, cobalt-60, and cesium 137 have been widely used for various

medical and industrial purposes. For example, cesium 137 was used by the Soviets
to bombard wheat and other seeds to see if radiated seeds would produce more
abundant crops. It is also used in processing dental X-rays. Unfortunately, large
numbers of canisters of cesium 137, and other radioactive wastes are known to
be stored in facilities having little or no security. The Soviets appear to have left
considerable stores of powdered cesium 137 in various places in Georgia. No one
knows how much of this stored material has already been stolen or, possibly, sold.
Your I & W team has been assigned to the task evaluating the capabilities and
intentions of a certain known terrorist organization codenamed X. Based on recent
intelligence reports, your team has been asked to evaluate the hypothesis that
group X may be planning one or more actions using dirty bombs. According to
one report, a leader in group X was heard to boast that his group will have a very
unpleasant surprise for an unnamed American city. According to another report,
a person known to be a member of group X, codenamed “Ned,” was dismissed in
2002 from a doctoral program in nuclear physics at a university in Germany.
The I & W team must identify and carefully state the hypothesis regarding terror-
ist group X, taking into account the information it has. In any intelligence analysis
regarding the actions of some actual or potential adversary, the analysts need to
make inferences about an adversary’s capabilities and intentions. Capability and
intention must be distinguished: having capability does not entail intention, nor
does having intention entail capability. At the moment, however, the I & W team is
concerned with the capability of terrorist group X to develop a dirty bomb. Based
uponinformationaboutgroupX,theagencyconsidersitalmostcertainthatgroupX
has every intention of using any kind of weapon against the United States, given
the appropriate opportunity. Group X, like other current terrorist organizations,
seems to have an implacable hatred of American society and its values. Group X
has already participated in terrorist activities in which the lives of innocent persons,
including women and children, have been taken.
The team has identiﬁed the hypothesis as follows:
H: Group X now has the capability to assemble a dirty bomb containing cesium
137.
There is always an alternative hypothesis which, in this case, can be stated as:
not-H: Group X does not now have the capability to assemble a dirty bomb
containing cesium 137.
The team’s task is now to put hypothesis H to work in generating new evidence. The
team deems it very unlikely that it could obtain any direct evidence on H. Group X
maintains very strict control over the security of its operations and is known to have
employed the most medieval means of punishing any member whom it suspects of
divulging information about its activities. If they did have such direct evidence of
H, this evidence would be termed a “nugget.” Lacking any such nugget, they must
be prepared to mine lots of lower-grade evidential ore.

Analysis of Evidence
If hypothesis H is true, one proposition can easily be deduced: that group X
must have obtained, or will obtain, some powdered cesium 137. It is known that
such materials seem to be available throughout Eastern Europe including Georgia
and Poland. But we have no direct evidence that group X has in fact obtained any
powdered cesium 137. But, if group X has obtained, or will obtain, some pow-
dered cesium 137, we can deduce that some member of group X has had, or will
have, contacts with potential suppliers of powdered cesium 137 in Eastern Europe.
Finally, we deduce that the member of Group X who has had, or will have, contact
with potential suppliers of cesium 137 has at least some knowledge of radioactive
substances such as cesium 137. Figure 1.1 summarizes our top-down reasoning. At
each stage of this top-down reasoning we have a proposition that may be true or
false.
H: Group X now has the capability to assemble a 
dirty bomb containing powdered cesium 137.
G: Group X has obtained, or will obtain, a quantity of 
powdered cesium 137
F: A  member of group X has had, or will have, 
contacts with potential suppliers of powdered cesium 
137 in Eastern Europe
E: The member of Group X who has had or will have 
contacts with potential suppliers of powdered cesium 
137 has knowledge of radioactive substances.

physicsatauniversityinGermany.ThoughNedmayhavefailedtocompletehisPhD
in nuclear physics, we can easily suppose that he knows enough about radioactive
materials to be highly useful in obtaining such materials as powdered cesium 137
and in handling such materials during the construction of a dirty bomb. Here is a
summary of what this top-down reasoning has enabled us to do.
From hypothesis H the team has generated a new line of inquiry involving the
activities of group X. It is known that many members of known terrorist organi-
zations have studied various areas of the sciences in Western universities. It is also
known that not all of these persons have completed their degree requirements. So,
just ﬁnding out that Ned left a university without ﬁnishing his degree is, by itself,
quite uninformative. But the argument we have constructed links Ned with group
X’s efforts to develop one or more dirty weapons that could easily be used against
us.
The top-down reasoning we have developed seems entirely plausible. If H is
true, this suggests that G is true: Group X must have or will acquire some of this
radioactive material to develop a dirty bomb using cesium 137. If G is true, this
suggests that F is true: A member of group X has had or will have contact with
potential suppliers of cesium 137. Finally, if F is true, this suggests that E may be
true: Someone in group X is qualiﬁed to inspect the cesium 137, to see what kind
of container it is in, and how it might best be made available for use by group X in
constructing a dirty bomb.
Finally, we note that propositions or events at each stage of reasoning may or
may not be true; in other words, each proposition represents a source of doubt.
For a start, H might not be true; perhaps group X has other plans for our dis-
comfort. Proposition G might not be true either. Perhaps the cost of obtaining a
sufﬁcient quantity of cesium 137 exceeds the present resources of group X (another
hypothesis, D, to be explored). Or, perhaps the security of stores of radioactive
materials in Eastern Europe has tightened in light of public knowledge about how
weak such security has been in the past (another hypothesis, C, to be explored).
Proposition F might not be true since obtaining materials like cesium 137 might
not have to involve any member of group X itself (another hypothesis, B, to be
explored). It is possible that group X might have obtained some of this material
without exposing any of its members to the scrutiny of various intelligence agencies.
Finally, it might not require an unusual degree of expertise in nuclear physics to
negotiate for and obtain substances like cesium 137 (another hypothesis, A, to be
explored).
Questions and a problem
1 Your I & W team has received evidence from an airline that Ned traveled to Warsaw
last month and has booked another ﬂight to Warsaw next week. The argument
the team has constructed establishes the relevance of Ned’s travel activities to
hypothesis H. Ned is a member of group X who is qualiﬁed to inspect the cesium 137,

to see what kind of container it is in, and to work out how it might best be made
available for use by group X in constructing a dirty bomb. In light of those facts, you
have been asked to recommend steps that should be taken to conﬁrm or negate a new
hypothesis: Ned is traveling to Warsaw to arrange for or conﬁrm the arrangements for
the shipping and delivery of cesium 137 to group X. Will this require top-down or
bottom-up reasoning or both? Identify plausible innocent explanations inconsistent
with this new hypothesis. (There is a natural tendency to focus on ﬁnding evidence
that will support a hypothesis, but a good analyst knows that it is equally important to
seek evidence that would negate the hypothesis.)
2 How should the I & W team proceed to investigate hypotheses A, B, and C? Does your
response with respect to each hypothesis involve top-down or bottom-up reasoning
or both?
3 Top-down reasoning, as illustrated in the above ﬁctitious example, is very common in
fact investigation in law. Suppose your ﬁrm represents a client who claims that her
arm was broken when she slipped and fell down the stairs in the building where her
doctor has his ofﬁce. You have determined that the ﬁrm must show that the owner or
manager of the building breached a duty of care to warn persons who might use the
stairs of any unusual conditions that might cause an injury. The senior partner has
asked you to advise what steps the ﬁrm should take. Use the top-down method
illustrated above in formulating your response.
3. The doctor and the detective: Joseph Bell and Sherlock Holmes
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle frequently mentioned that a major source of inspiration for
hisdevelopmentofthecharacterofSherlockHolmeswasaprofessorheencountered
when he was a student at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. Dr. Joseph
Bell was then a noted professor of surgery who, in 1887, was president of the Royal
College of Surgeons in Edinburgh. Dr. Bell was also personal surgeon to Queen
Victoria whenever she was in Scotland. For a time when he was in medical school,
Conan Doyle served as an assistant to Dr. Bell. As skilled as Dr. Bell was, it was
his astonishingly acute inferential or diagnostic skills for which he is now best
remembered, thanks, perhaps, to Sherlock Holmes. Over the years his students kept
an account of examples of Dr. Bell’s diagnostic feats, some of which are recorded in
Britain’s leading medical journals, such as the Lancet. Following is an example of
his diagnostic skill that today we would say involves the same abductive reasoning
illustrated in so many of the exploits of Sherlock Holmes and also illustrated in
Kemelman’s “The Nine Mile Walk.”
a. The doctor
The City of Edinburgh and its port city Leith lie on the Firth of Forth. Directly
north across the Firth lies a town in Fife called Burntisland [pronounced “burnt
island”]. In Bell’s day, there was no Forth Road Bridge; travelers used any one of a
number of ferries to cross from Fife to Edinburgh; the closest and most direct ferry
left Fife from Burntisland. From Leith, a street called Inverleith Row leads in the

direction of the University of Edinburgh. To the right of Inverleith Row, just past
Leith, lie Edinburgh’s Botanical Gardens. Dr. Bell frequently interviewed patients
in an amphitheater and allowed his students to observe these interviews. Here is
what his students observed on one occasion.
A woman, accompanied by a child, was shown into the amphitheater. Dr.
Bell had never met nor seen this woman before. After greeting her, Dr. Bell ﬁrst
asked her if she had a good crossing from Burntisland; the woman replied “aye”
[yes]. Bell then asked her if she had a good walk up Inverleith Row; the woman
replied “aye.” Then Bell asked her what she did with the other child; the woman
replied that she had left the child with her sister in Leith. Finally, Dr. Bell asked
the woman if she was still working at a linoleum factory; the woman replied
“aye.”
Dr. Bell’s students were of course astonished by this encounter between Dr. Bell
and the woman whom he had never seen before. In explanation, Dr. Bell ﬁrst told
his students that they must have noticed her Fife accent and that the closest ferry
would have left from Burntisland. He then asked the students if they noticed the red
clay on her shoes, which he explained was peculiar to areas around the Botanical
Gardens. Then Bell asked his students if they noticed that a coat the woman was
carrying over her shoulder was too large for the child who accompanied her; she
very likely had another child with her when she crossed from Fife. Finally, Dr. Bell
asked his students to observe the dermatitis on her hands, which he explained was
peculiar to persons who worked in linoleum factories.
b. The detective
“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.
“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I
should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.”
∗∗∗
“Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told
you, on our ﬁrst meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.”
“You were told, no doubt.”
“Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the
train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind that I arrived at the conclusion
without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The
train of reasoning ran, ‘Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a
military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for
his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He
has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm
has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics
could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded?
Clearly in Afghanistan.’ The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I
then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.” (Conan
Doyle, A Study in Scarlet (1887)).

Analysis of Evidence
Notes and a question
1 Sir Arthur Conan Doyle frequently mentioned that Dr. Joseph Bell was a major
source of inspiration for his development of the character of Sherlock Holmes.
For a time when he was in medical school Conan Doyle served as an assistant to
Dr. Bell. If you have read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories, you will note the
similarity between what happened in Dr. Bell’s interview just described and so
many instances in which Holmes amazed Dr. Watson with his acute
observational and inferential abilities. Both were highly skilled in the use of
what would today be called abductive logic. But abductive logic can only
identify hypotheses to be tested.
2 In these anecdotes Bell’s and Holmes’s hypotheses were conﬁrmed by the
woman and Watson respectively. Suppose that they had not. Absent
conﬁrmation, would you accept Dr. Bell’s or Holmes’s conclusions? Can you
construct a different scenario in each instance that would also be consistent
with all of the observed details?
4. Generalizations and stories: Sam’s party

2 Can you infer from this passage:
a That there was a cake?
b What kind of party this was?
c Sam’s age?
3 How would you justify such inferences?
C. Evidence and inference in legal contexts
1. Two murders
a. The murder of Y
Y was murdered in his home at approximately 4:30 p.m. on January 1. W states that
she saw X enter Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on that day. Show how W’s statement tends
to support the conclusion that it was X who murdered Y.
b. Bywaters and Thompson
Edith Thompson was charged with the murder of her husband Percy in that she
either conspired with or incited her lover, Frederick Bywaters, to murder Percy.
i In the trial it was assumed that the fact that Edith was 28 and Freddie was 20 was
relevant to the charge. Is this a reasonable assumption? If so, why?

ii Construct a chain of inferences from the fact that Edith was older than Freddie that

iii Can the same fact be used as part of an argument in defense of Edith?
2. Imaginative reasoning: The Nine Mile Walk (Kemelman (1947))
I had made an ass of myself in a speech I had given at the Good Government Association
dinner, and Nicky Welt had cornered me at breakfast at the Blue Moon, where we
both ate occasionally, for the pleasure of rubbing it in. I had made the mistake of
departing from my prepared speech to criticize a statement my predecessor in the
ofﬁce of County Attorney had made to the press. I had drawn a number of inferences
from his statement and had thus left myself open to a rebuttal which he had promptly
made and which had the effect of making me appear intellectually dishonest. I was new
to this political game, having but a few months before left the Law School faculty to
become the Reform Party candidate for County Attorney. I said as much in extenuation,
but Nicholas Welt, who could never drop his pedagogical manner (he was Snowdon
Professor of English Language and Literature), replied in much the same tone that he
would dismiss a request from a sophomore for an extension on a term paper, “That’s no
excuse.”
Although he is only two or three years older than I, in his late forties, he always treats
me like a schoolmaster hectoring a stupid pupil. And I, perhaps because he looks so
much older with his white hair and lined, gnomelike face, suffer it.
“They were perfectly logical inferences,” I pleaded.
“My dear boy,” he purred, “although human intercourse is well-nigh impossible
without inference, most inferences are usually wrong. The percentage of error is par-
ticularly high in the legal profession where the intention is not to discover what the
speaker wishes to convey, but rather what he wishes to conceal.”
I picked up my check and eased out from behind the table.
“I suppose you are referring to cross-examination of witnesses in court. Well, there’s
always an opposing counsel who will object if the inference is illogical.”
“Who said anything about logic?” he retorted. “An inference can be logical and still
not be true.”
He followed me down the aisle to the cashier’s booth. I paid my check and waited
impatiently while he searched in an old-fashioned change purse, ﬁshing out coins one
by one and placing them on the counter beside his check, only to discover that the total
was insufﬁcient. He slid them back into his purse and with a tiny sigh extracted a bill
from another compartment of the purse and handed it to the cashier.
“Give me any sentence of ten or twelve words,” he said, “and I’ll build you a logical
chain of inferences that you never dreamed of when you framed the sentence.”
Other customers were coming in, and since the space in front of the cashier’s booth
was small, I decided to wait outside until Nicky completed his transaction with the
cashier. I remember being mildly amused at the idea that he probably thought I was
still at his elbow and was going right ahead with his discourse.
When he joined me on the sidewalk I said, “A nine mile walk is no joke, especially
in the rain.”

Analysis of Evidence
“No, I shouldn’t think it would be,” he agreed absently. Then he stopped in his stride
and looked at me sharply. “What the devil are you talking about?”
“It’s a sentence and it has eleven words,” I insisted. And I repeated the sentence,
ticking off the words on my ﬁngers.
“What about it?”
“You said that given a sentence of ten or twelve words – ”
“Oh, yes.” He looked at me suspiciously. “Where did you get it?”
“It just popped into my head. Come on now, build your inferences.”
“You’re serious about this?” he asked, his little blue eyes glittering with amusement.
“You really want me to?”
It was just like him to issue a challenge and then to appear amused when I accepted
it. And it made me angry.
“Put up or shut up,” I said.
“All right,” he said mildly. “No need to be huffy. I’ll play. Hm-m, let me see, how did
the sentence go? ‘A nine mile walk is no joke, especially in the rain.’ Not much to go on
there.”
“It’s more than ten words,” I rejoined.
“Very well.” His voice became crisp as he mentally squared off to the problem. “First
inference: the speaker is aggrieved.”
“I’ll grant that,” I said, “although it hardly seems to be an inference. It’s really implicit
in the statement.”
He nodded impatiently. “Next inference: the rain was unforeseen, otherwise he
would have said, ‘A nine mile walk in the rain is no joke,’ instead of using the ‘especially’
phrase as an afterthought.”
“I’ll allow that,” I said, “although it’s pretty obvious.”
“First inferences should be obvious,” said Nicky tartly.
I let it go at that. He seemed to be ﬂoundering and I didn’t want to rub it in.
“Next inference: the speaker is not an athlete or an outdoors man.”
“You’ll have to explain that one,” I said.
“It’s the ‘especially’ phrase again,” he said. “The speaker does not say that a nine-mile
walk in the rain is no joke, but merely the walk – just the distance, mind you – is no
joke. Now, nine miles is not such a terribly long distance. You walk more than half that
in eighteen holes of golf – and golf is an old man’s game,” he added slyly. I play golf.
“Well, that would be all right under ordinary circumstances,” I said, “But there are
other possibilities. The speaker might be a soldier in the jungle, in which case nine miles
would be a pretty good hike, rain or no rain.”
“Yes,” and Nicky was sarcastic, “and the speaker might be one-legged. For that
matter, the speaker might be a graduate student writing a Ph.D. thesis on humor and
starting by listing all the things that are not funny. See here, I’ll have to make a couple
of assumptions before I continue.”
“How do you mean?” I asked, suspiciously.
“Remember, I’m taking this sentence in vacuo, as it were. I don’t know who said it or
what the occasion was. Normally a sentence belongs in the framework of a situation.”
“I see. What assumptions do you want to make?”

“Foronething,Iwanttoassumethattheintentionwasnotfrivolous,thatthespeaker
is referring to a walk that was actually taken, and that the purpose of the walk was not
to win a bet or something of that sort.”
“That seems reasonable enough,” I said.
“And I also want to assume that the locale of the walk is here.”
“You mean here in Fairﬁeld?”
“Not necessarily. I mean in this general section of the country.”
“Fair enough.”
“Then, if you grant those assumptions, you’ll have to accept my last inference that
the speaker is no athlete or outdoors man.”
“Well, all right, go on.”
“Then my next inference is that the walk was taken very late at night or very early
in the morning – say, between midnight and ﬁve or six in the morning.”
“How do you ﬁgure that one?” I asked.
“Consider the distance, nine miles. We’re in a fairly well-populated section. Take
any road and you’ll ﬁnd a community of some sort in less than nine miles. Hadley is
ﬁve miles away, Hadley Falls is seven and a half, Goreton is eleven, but East Goreton
is only eight and you strike East Goreton before you come to Goreton. There is local
train service along the Goreton road and bus service along the others. All the highways
are pretty well traveled. Would anyone have to walk nine miles in a rain unless it were
late at night when no buses or trains were running and when the few automobiles that
were out would hesitate to pick up a stranger on the highway?”
“He might not have wanted to be seen,” I suggested.
Nicky smiled pityingly. “You think he would be less noticeable trudging along the
highway than he would be riding in a public conveyance where everyone is usually
absorbed in his newspaper?”
“Well, I won’t press the point,” I said brusquely.
“Then try this one: he was walking toward a town rather than away from one.”
I nodded. “It is more likely, I suppose. If he were in a town, he could probably arrange
for some sort of transportation. Is that the basis for your inference?”
“Partlythat,”saidNicky,“butthereisalsoaninferencetobedrawnfromthedistance.
Remember, it’s a nine mile walk and nine is one of the exact numbers.”
“I’m afraid I don’t understand.”
That exasperated schoolteacher-look appeared on Nicky’s face again. “Suppose you
say, ‘I took a ten mile walk’ or ‘a hundred mile drive’; I would assume that you actually
walked anywhere from eight to a dozen miles, or that you rode between ninety and a
hundred and ten miles. In other words, ten and hundred are round numbers. You might
have walked exactly ten miles or just as likely you might have walked approximately ten
miles. But when you speak of walking nine miles, I have a right to assume that you have
named an exact ﬁgure. Now, we are far more likely to know the distance of the city from
a given point than we are to know the distance of a given point from the city. That is,
ask anyone in the city how far out Farmer Brown lives, and if he knows him, he will say,
‘Three or four miles.’ But ask Farmer Brown how far he lives from the city and he will
tell you, ‘Three and six-tenths miles – measured it on my speedometer many a time.’

Analysis of Evidence
“It’s weak, Nicky,” I said.
“But in conjunction with your own suggestion that he could have arranged trans-
portation if he had been in a city – ”
“Yes, that would do it,” I said. “I’ll pass it. Any more?”
“I’ve just begun to hit my stride,” he boasted. “My next inference is that he was going
to a deﬁnite destination and that he had to be there at a particular time. It was not a
case of going off to get help because his car broke down or his wife was going to have a
baby or somebody was trying to break into his house.”
“Oh, come now,” I said, “the car breaking down is really the most likely situation.
He could have known the exact distance from having checked the mileage just as he
was leaving the town.”
Nicky shook his head. “Rather than walk nine miles in the rain, he would have
curled up on the back seat and gone to sleep, or at least stayed by his car and tried to
ﬂag another motorist. Remember, it’s nine miles. What would be the least it would take
him to hike it?”
“Four hours,” I offered.
He nodded. “Certainly no less, considering the rain. We’ve agreed that it happened
very late at night or very early in the morning. Suppose he had his breakdown at one
o’clock in the morning. It would be ﬁve o’clock before he would arrive. That’s daybreak.
You begin to see a lot of cars on the road. The buses start just a little later. In fact, the
ﬁrst buses hit Fairﬁeld around ﬁve-thirty. Besides, if he were going for help, he would
not have to go all the way to town – only as far as the nearest telephone. No, he had
a deﬁnite appointment, and it was in a town, and it was for some time before ﬁve-
thirty.”
“Then why couldn’t he have got there earlier and waited?” I asked. “He could have
taken the last bus, arrived around one o’clock, and waited until his appointment. He
walks nine miles in the rain instead, and you said he was no athlete.”
We had arrived at the Municipal Building where my ofﬁce is. Normally, any argu-
ments begun at the Blue Moon ended at the entrance to the Municipal Building. But
I was interested in Nicky’s demonstration and I suggested that he come up for a few
minutes.
When we were seated I said, “How about it, Nicky, why couldn’t he have arrived
early and waited?”
“He could have,” Nicky retorted. “But since he did not, we must assume that he was
either detained until after the last bus left, or that he had to wait where he was for a
signal of some sort, perhaps a telephone call.”
“Then according to you, he had an appointment some time between midnight and
ﬁve-thirty –”
“We can draw it much ﬁner than that. Remember, it takes him four hours to walk
the distance. The last bus stops at twelve-thirty a.m. If he doesn’t take that, but starts
at the same time, he won’t arrive at his destination until four-thirty. On the other
hand, if he takes the ﬁrst bus in the morning, he will arrive around ﬁve-thirty. That
would mean that his appointment was for some time between four-thirty and ﬁve-
thirty.”

“You mean that if his appointment was earlier than four-thirty, he would have taken
the last night bus, and if it was later than ﬁve-thirty, he would have taken the ﬁrst
morning bus?”
“Precisely. And another thing: if he was waiting for a signal or a phone call, it must
have come not much later than one o’clock.”
“Yes, I see that,” I said. “If his appointment is around ﬁve o’clock and it takes him
four hours to walk the distance, he’d have to start around one.”
He nodded, silent and thoughtful. For some queer reason I could not explain, I did
not feel like interrupting his thoughts. On the wall was a large map of the county and I
walked over to it and began to study it.
“You’re right, Nicky,” I remarked over my shoulder, “there’s no place as far as nine
miles away from Fairﬁeld that doesn’t hit another town ﬁrst, Fairﬁeld is right in the
middle of a bunch of smaller towns.”
He joined me at the map. “It doesn’t have to be Fairﬁeld, you know,” he said quietly.
“It was probably one of the outlying towns he had to reach. Try Hadley.”
“Why Hadley? What would anyone want in Hadley at ﬁve o’clock in the morning?”
“The Washington Flyer stops there to take on water about that time,” he said quietly.
“That’s right, too,” I said. “I’ve heard that train many a night when I couldn’t sleep.
I’d hear it pulling in and then a minute or two later I’d hear the clock on the Methodist
Church banging out ﬁve.” I went back to my desk for a timetable. “The Flyer leaves
Washington at twelve forty-seven a.m. and gets into Boston at eight a.m.”
Nicky was still at the map measuring distances with a pencil.
“Exactly nine miles from Hadley is the Old Sumter Inn,” he announced.
“Old Sumter Inn,” I echoed. “But that upsets the whole theory. You can arrange for
transportation there as easily as you can in a town.”
Heshookhishead.“Thecarsarekeptinanenclosureandyouhavetogetanattendant
to check you through the gate. The attendant would remember anyone taking out his
car at a strange hour. It’s a pretty conservative place. He could have waited in his
room until he got a call from Washington about someone on the Flyer – maybe the
number of the car and the berth. Then he could just slip out of the hotel and walk to
Hadley.”
I stared at him, hypnotized.
“It wouldn’t be difﬁcult to slip aboard while the train was taking on water, and then
if he knew the car number and the berth –”
“Nicky,” I said portentously, “as the Reform District Attorney who campaigned on
an economy program, I am going to waste the taxpayers’ money and call Boston long
distance. It’s ridiculous, it’s insane – but I’m going to do it!”
His little blue eyes glittered and he moistened his lips with the tip of his tongue.
“Go ahead,” he said hoarsely.
I replaced the telephone in its cradle.
“Nicky,” I said, “this is probably the most remarkable coincidence in the history of
criminal investigation: a man was found murdered in his berth on last night’s twelve-
forty-seven from Washington! He’d been dead about three hours, which would make it
exactly right for Hadley.”

Analysis of Evidence
“I thought it was something like that,” said Nicky. “But you’re wrong about its being
a coincidence. It can’t be. Where did you get that sentence?”
“It was just a sentence. It simply popped into my head.”
“It couldn’t have! It’s not the sort of sentence that pops into one’s head. If you had
taught composition as long as I have, you’d know that when you ask someone for a
sentence of ten words or so, you get an ordinary statement such as ‘I like milk’ – with
the other words made up by a modifying clause like, ‘because it is good for my health.’
The sentence you offered related to a particular situation.”
“But I tell you I talked to no one this morning. And I was alone with you at the Blue
Moon.”
“You weren’t with me all the time I paid my check,” he said sharply. “Did you meet
anyone while you were waiting on the sidewalk for me to come out of the Blue Moon?”
I shook my head. “I was outside for less than a minute before you joined me. You
see, a couple of men came in while you were digging out your change and one of them
bumped me, so I thought I’d wait –”
“Did you ever see them before?”
“Who?”
“The two men who came in,” he said, the note of exasperation creeping into his
voice again.
“Why, no – they weren’t anyone I knew.”
“Were they talking?”
“I guess so. Yes, they were. Quite absorbed in their conversation, as a matter of fact –
otherwise, they would have noticed me and I would not have been bumped.”
“Not many strangers come into the Blue Moon,” he remarked.
“Do you think it was they?” I asked eagerly. “I think I’d know them again if I saw
them.”
Nicky’s eyes narrowed. “It’s possible. There had to be two – one to trail the victim in
Washington and ascertain his berth number, the other to wait here and do the job. The
Washington man would be likely to come down here afterwards. If there was theft as
well as murder, it would be to divide the spoils. If it was just murder, he would probably
have to come down to pay off his confederate.”
I reached for the telephone.
“We’ve been gone less than half an hour,” Nicky went on. “They were just coming in
and service is slow at the Blue Moon. The one who walked all the way to Hadley must
certainly be hungry and the other probably drove all night from Washington.”
“Call me immediately if you make an arrest,” I said into the phone and hung up.
Neither of us spoke a word while we waited. We paced the ﬂoor, avoiding each other
almost as though we had done something we were ashamed of.
The telephone rang at last. I picked it up and listened. Then I said, “O.K.” and turned
to Nicky.
“One of them tried to escape through the kitchen but Winn had someone stationed
at the back and they got him.”
“That would seem to prove it,” said Nicky with a frosty little smile.
I nodded agreement.

He glanced at his watch. “Gracious,” he exclaimed, “I wanted to make an early start
on my work this morning, and here I’ve already wasted all this time talking with you.”
I let him get to the door. “Oh, Nicky,” I called, “what was it you set out to prove?”
“That a chain of inferences could be logical and still not be true,” he said.
“Oh.”
“What are you laughing at?” he asked snappishly. And then he laughed too.
Questions
1 “The Nine Mile Walk” is a nice example of imaginative reasoning leading to the
construction of a hypothetical scenario of the events surrounding the murder on the
Washington Flier. Assume that A and B are the men who have been arrested and that
C was the victim. Restate Welt’s conclusion in the form of a story starting at the New
Sumter Inn and ending with the meeting at the Blue Moon Caf´e. Is the story
plausible? Given Kemelman’s account, what odds might a rational betting person
calculate as the likelihood that it was either A or B who murdered C?
2 Welt infers: “It is the man who said: ‘A nine mile walk is no joke, especially in the rain’
in the Blue Moon Caf´e this morning who is the person who murdered C.” For
Kemelman, this may be critical.
a How does Welt support the inference that the statement was made?
b How does he support the inference that it was made in the Caf´e that morning?
c Assume that Kemelman’s recollection does not improve. In most jurisdictions, the
two men would be entitled to a preliminary hearing to determine whether the
evidence shows that there was and is probable cause to believe that the two men
are responsible for the murder of C sufﬁcient to justify their (i) arrest and
(ii) prosecution. Could the prosecution prove that either of the men arrested
made the statement? Absent evidence that either of the men made the statement,
could the prosecution show that the police had probable cause to arrest the two
men?
3 Two men, A and B, have been arrested on suspicion of the murder of C. B is the one
who left the Blue Moon by the rear. He was unarmed. Assume that one will be
charged as principal; the other as accessory. Place yourself in Kemelman’s position
immediately after Welt has left the ofﬁce. The time for playing Watson to Welt’s
Holmes is over; you are a prosecutor who must now seek evidence sufﬁcient to prove
that: It was A (or B) who murdered C.
a The elements of the crime deﬁne the conditions that the ultimate proposition to be
proved (the ultimate probandum) must satisfy. Connecticut statutes currently
provide:
A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another
person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a
suicide by force, duress or deception . . . (Conn. Gen. Stat. §53a–54a)
A person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense,
who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another

Analysis of Evidence
person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally
liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the
principal offender. (Conn. Gen. Stat. §53a–8)
What precisely must Kemelman seek to prove? Frame the ultimate proposition to
be proved for the murderer and for the accessory. The standard of proof at trial will
be “beyond reasonable doubt”; what standard should guide (a) the decision to
arrest, (b) the decision to charge with murder? Are these standards met in the story?
3. Generalizations, stories, and arguments2
a. Brides in the bath: closing speech3
George Joseph Smith, who was married, had gone through a ceremony of marriage
withthreewomeninclosesuccession–BessieMundy,AliceBurnham,andMargaret
Lofty. He induced each of them to execute a will naming him as her beneﬁciary. Each
of them drowned in a bathtub shortly thereafter. He was indicted and tried for the
murder of Ms. Mundy. The prosecution was permitted to introduce evidence about
the “marriages,” wills, and circumstances of the death of the other two women. The
following is an excerpt from the closing speech for the Crown.
The prisoner and the woman being alone in the house, he had the opportunity of com-
mitting the crime. The motive of the prisoner has been demonstrated, the opportunity
admitted, and the exclusion of accident proved. You are entitled to look at the evidence
as to the two other deaths to see whether the death of Miss Mundy was accident or
designed, and, if designed, for the beneﬁt of whom? You can also look at that evidence
to see whether the death was part of a system or course of conduct – horrible as it is to
think so – of deliberately causing people’s deaths in order that monetary beneﬁt might
ensue to him.
The three cases are of such a character that such a large aggregation of resemblances
cannot have occurred without design. In each case the prisoner went through the form
of marriage; in each case the ready money of the woman was either realized or drawn
out of whatever deposit bank it might have been in; in each case there was a will drawn
in favour of the prisoner absolutely; in each case the will was drawn by a stranger to the
testatrix; in each case the victim insured her life or was possessed of property which did
not make it necessary to insure her life; in each case there was a visit to a doctor shortly
before the death, which, we contend, was unnecessary from the physical condition of
the patient; in each case the women wrote letters to relatives the night before, or on the
night on which they died; in each case there was an inquiry as to a bathroom (or the
provision of a bath); in each case the woman died from drowning, and the prisoner
was the ﬁrst to discover it; in each case the bathroom doors were unfastened and the
water was not drawn off until after the doctor had been; and in each case the prisoner
was putting demonstrably forward the purchase of either ﬁsh, or eggs, or tomatoes to
show that he was absent from the house in which his wife was lying dead; and in each

case there was the prisoner’s subsequent disappearance and the monetary advantage
resulting or attempted to be made to result.
Questions
This is the peroration of the famous closing speech by Archibald Bodkin QC in R.
v. George Joseph Smith.
1 Is this a story or an argument or both?
2 To what extent does the persuasiveness of the passage depend on (i) logic (ii) rhetoric?
3 Can you summarize the argument in a single sentence?
b. Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681 (1988)
A federal grand jury indicted Gary Rufus Huddleston, charging that, in April 1985,
he had sold (count one) and had possessed (count two) Memorex videocassette
tapes (the “tapes”) that had been stolen in interstate commerce. The tapes had been
stolen, and Huddleston had sold and had possessed quantities of the tapes. The
only issue in dispute was whether Huddleston knew that the tapes had been stolen
at the time he had sold or possessed them. The issue was apparently a close one:
After two days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Huddleston on the charge that
he had knowingly sold stolen tapes, but convicted him on the charge that he had
knowingly possessed stolen tapes.
According to Huddleston, Leroy Wesby had a large quantity of the tapes, had
invitedHuddlestontosellthemonacommissionbasis,andhadassuredHuddleston
that the tapes were legitimate. Huddleston offered and sold quantities of the tapes
at prices that were below the cost of manufacturing the tapes. Huddleston acknowl-
edged that he had possessed and sold substantial quantities of the tapes, but claimed
that he had no knowledge that they were stolen.
The government introduced evidence that, in February 1985, Huddleston had
arranged a sale of 38 new 12′′ black and white television sets (the “TV sets”), also
supplied by Wesby, to Paul Toney, a retailer, for $28 per set. Huddleston did not
produce a bill of sale at trial and, according to Toney, he got the impression that
Huddleston could obtain a lot more of these sets.
The government also offered evidence that in May 1985, Huddleston had offered
to sell to an FBI undercover agent a large quantity of Amana appliances that also had
been supplied by Wesby. It was undisputed that these appliances had been stolen.
Huddleston testiﬁed that he had asked and Wesby had assured him that the TV sets
and the appliances were legitimate.
Questions
1 In its opinion, the Supreme Court said:
In assessing whether the evidence was sufﬁcient to support a ﬁnding that the
televisions were stolen, the court here was required to consider not only the direct

Analysis of Evidence
evidence on that point – the low price of the televisions, the large quantity offered
for sale, and petitioner’s inability to produce a bill of sale – but also the evidence
concerning petitioner’s involvement in the sales of other stolen merchandise obtained
from Wesby, such as the Memorex tapes and the Amana appliances. Given this
evidence, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the televisions were
stolen, and the trial court therefore properly allowed the evidence to go to the
jury. (Id. at 691 (emphasis added))
a The Joint Appendix ﬁled with the Court contained no evidence concerning the
wholesale price of 12′′ black and white TV sets. How did the Court conclude that
$28 was a price so low as to excite suspicion that the sets were stolen?
b Did the fact that the Memorex tapes Huddleston sold in April and the fact that the
Amana appliances he offered for sale in May were stolen support an inference that
the TV sets he stole in February were also stolen goods? If so, explain how.
c For every step in an inferential argument, there must be a generalization that
makes the step logical. What generalizations would justify the italicized portion of
the Court’s statement?
2 The government based its theory of relevance upon a generalization, which, according
to the Supreme Court, was:
. . . the televisions were stolen, and proof that petitioner [Huddleston] had engaged
in a series of sales of stolen merchandise from the same suspicious source would be
strong evidence that he was aware that each of these items, including the Memorex
tapes, was stolen. (Id. at 686)
a Do you ﬁnd the generalization urged by the government persuasive? Are there any
ﬂaws that should be corrected?
b How does the fact that the Amana appliances Huddleston offered for sale in May
were stolen support an inference that Huddleston knew in April that the Memorex
tapes were stolen?
c Assuming that the sale of stolen tapes in April and the stolen appliances in May
support an inference that the TV sets sold in February were stolen, did that fact
support further inference that Huddleston knew that the Memorex tapes were
stolen in February?
d How would you argue that the improper prejudicial effects of introducing
evidence about (i) Huddleston’s sale of the TV sets and (ii) his offer to sell the
Amana appliances substantially outweighed any legitimate probative value that
evidence might have with respect to Huddleston’s knowledge that the
Memorex tapes were stolen? Examine each transaction separately and then in
combination. Identify each improper prejudicial effect and then construct your
argument.
c. Miller v. Jackson (Lord Denning MR) [1977] 3 All E. R. 340, 340–41 (CA)
In a summer time village cricket is the delight of everyone. Nearly every village has its
own cricket ﬁeld where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of
Lintz in County Durham they have their own ground, where they have played these

last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outﬁeld
is kept short. It has a good club-house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The
village team plays there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, competing
with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practice while the
light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they
must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done
it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built,
or has had built for him, a house on the edge of the cricket ground which four years
ago was a ﬁeld where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this
adjoining ﬁeld has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the
houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point.
Now he complains that, when a batsman hits a six, the ball has been known to land in
his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go
out at weekends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say
that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the
judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped; with
the consequences, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket
ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The
young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much
the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next
to the cricket ground.
Questions
1 Is this a story?
2 Some people ﬁnd this persuasive, but others consider it “unjudge-like.” What reasons
might be given in support of each view?
3 Can you show that in this passage, read on its own, Lord Denning (i) contradicted
himself; (ii) invented some facts; (iii) introduced facts that are not relevant to a claim
in nuisance?
4. Evidence from two causes c´el`ebres
a. Commonwealth v. Sacco and Vanzetti (Mass. 1921)
Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti emigrated from Italy to America in the
early 1900s. They were regularly employed and were respected and well liked by
everyone who had contact with them. In 1920 Sacco was employed as a shoe-
edger and Vanzetti as a ﬁsh-peddler. But they were also implacable anarchists.
Following World War I, there were many instances of what we would today call
acts of terrorism. Members of anarchistic groups were associated with these acts of
terrorism, and Sacco and Vanzetti were members of one of these groups. In 1920
they were charged with felony murder in a commonplace but ruthless crime. They
were tried, convicted, and executed in 1927. Their trial is arguably the ranking cause
c´el`ebre in American legal history. Their case has been referred to as “the case that
will not die.” Arguments exist to this day about whether Sacco and Vanzetti were

convicted for being murderers or for being anarchists. One major element of the
argument that they were wrongly convicted concerns the authenticity of certain
ﬁrearms evidence against Sacco.
On Thursday, April 15, 1920, two payroll guards, Alessandro Berardelli and
Frederick Parmenter, were carrying two metal boxes containing $15,773.15 in bills
and coin, which represented the week’s payroll for employees of the Slater-Morrill
ShoeCompanyinSouthBraintree,Massachusetts.AstheyheadeddownPearlStreet
in the direction of this shoe company, Berardelli and Parmenter were attacked by
two men whom witnesses said were loitering in the vicinity of the crime scene.
Berardelli was shot four times and died instantly. Parmenter was shot twice and
died the next day; he was not able to identify his assailants.
On May 5, 1920, Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested for reasons having nothing
to do with this crime. Police ofﬁcers Michael Connolly and Frank Vaughn arrested
them. They had been told that they were suspicious persons and that they had stolen
a car. At the time of their arrest, Sacco was carrying a 32-caliber Colt automatic
pistol. On September 11, they were indicted and charged with ﬁrst degree felony
murder for the slaying of Berardelli and Parmenter.
At their trial, Ofﬁcer Connolly testiﬁed: “Sacco attempted on several occasions
to put his hand under his overcoat in spite of being warned [by Connolly] not
to do so.” Later in the trial, a forensic surgeon, Dr. Magrath, testiﬁed that he had
extracted four 32-caliber bullets from the body of Berardelli and marked each one
on its base with Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV. Magrath testiﬁed that Bullet III,
admitted at trial as Exhibit 18, was the bullet that killed Berardelli. During the trial,
the prosecution went to considerable lengths to show that Exhibit 18 had been ﬁred
through the 32-caliber Colt automatic that was alleged to belong to Sacco. The
court allowed both the prosecution and defense to test-ﬁre bullets through Sacco’s
32-caliber Colt automatic to see if the markings on the test bullets matched those of
Exhibit 18 shown at trial. Prosecution and defense ballistics experts disagreed about
whether Exhibit 18 had been ﬁred through Sacco’s 32-caliber Colt automatic.
All witnesses to the shooting testiﬁed that one gunman ﬁred four shots in succes-
sion into Berardelli’s body. When the four bullets are examined together, however,
it is obvious that the riﬂing pattern on Exhibit 18 does not match the patterns on
Bullets I, II, and IV. Exhibit 18 cannot have been ﬁred from the same weapon as the
other three bullets. (The prosecution never showed the four bullets all together at
trial and were never requested to do so by the defense.)
Questions
1 Did Connolly’s testimony that: “Sacco attempted on several occasions to put his hand
under his overcoat in spite of being warned [by Connolly] not to do so” make it any
more probable that it was Sacco who shot Berardelli? Identify each inference that must
be accepted in order to demonstrate that Connolly’s testimony was relevant to the
proposition it was Sacco who shot Berardelli.

2 What is the signiﬁcance of the fact that the riﬂing pattern on Exhibit 18 does not
match the patterns on Bullets I, II, and IV and the resulting inference that Exhibit 18
cannot have been ﬁred from the same weapon as the other three bullets? What are the
possible explanations for this discrepancy? Had the comparison been made at trial,
how would you have explained the discrepancy if you were the prosecutor? If you were
counsel for Sacco, what additional inferences would you argue that the jury should
make based upon the comparison of the four bullets?
b. People v. Simpson (Cal. 1994)
In July, 1994, the state of California formally charged that Orenthal James Simpson
(OJS)hadmurderedhisformerwife,NicoleBrownSimpson(NBS),andabystander,
Ronald L. Goldman (RLG), on June 12, 1994. The trial took place in 1995. One of
the issues was whether OJS could have had an opportunity to commit the crimes.
The only evidence presented at trial bearing upon that issue is summarized below.
Sometime between 10:15 and 10:20 p.m., on June 12, 1994, Pablo Fuentes heard
the “plaintive wail” of a dog. Around 10:45 p.m., Steven Schwab found NBS’s Akita
with blood on its paws. At about the same time, Kato Kaelin, a guest in OJS’s house,
heard three thumps on the wall outside his bedroom that he thought might be an
earthquake. He went out and walked along a path behind the house, but he did
not see anything. Alan Park was a limousine driver scheduled to drive OJS to the
Los Angeles Airport to catch an 11:45 p.m. ﬂight to Chicago. He arrived at OJS’s
house early. He pressed the buzzer at the gate at 10:40 and again at 10:49 and got no
answer. At 10:55, Park saw an African-American male dressed in dark clothes enter
the house. At 10:56, he buzzed again and OJS answered. OJS said he had been in the
shower and would be out in a few minutes. Kaelin opened the gate and Park drove
the limo to the front door. There were two black duffel bags on the doorstep. At
11:00, OJS came out. He was wearing stone-washed blue jeans and a white polo shirt
and was carrying a coat over his arm and a designer hanging bag. Park shook hands
with him. He did not notice any cuts or blood on his hand or anything else unusual.
According to Detective Vannatter, it took about ﬁve minutes to drive, observing the
speed limit, from NBS’s house at 875 Bundy Drive to OJS’s house at 360 North
Rockingham Avenue.
Problems
1 Construct a story that accounts for each event and observation reported above and
that shows that OJS almost certainly could have murdered NBS and RLG.
2 Construct a story that accounts for each event and observation reported above and
that shows that OJS almost certainly could not have murdered NBS and RLG.

Analysis of Evidence
The Case File
In January, the United States Attorney for the Middle District of New State ﬁled an
indictment alleging that Richard Able had knowingly ﬁled a false federal income tax
return for the year 2003 with intent to defraud the federal government of income tax
due and owing. The indictment alleged that during 2003 Able had received income
in an amount no less than $45,000 that had not been included on his income tax
return for that year. The indictment is otherwise sufﬁcient, and the court has denied
the defendant’s motion to dismiss.
Pursuant to the court’s standing discovery order, the government has ﬁled a
list of prospective witnesses and copies of documents it may seek to introduce in
evidence. The list of prospective witnesses include: (i) Samuel Baker, managing
partner in a New York law ﬁrm (the “Law Firm”); (ii) Timothy Cooper, a certiﬁed
public accountant in New City; (iii) Carol Able, Able’s ex-wife; (iv) Linda Davis,
a model and Able’s ex-girlfriend; and (v) various bank ofﬁcers, Internal Revenue
Service ofﬁcials, and others who can lay a proper foundation for certain of the
documents listed. The documents produced include: (i) a cancelled check in the
amount of $25,000 dated December 15, 2003, issued by the Law Firm payable to
Able with endorsements showing that Able cashed it on December 20, 2003, at the
Citibank branch in Las Vegas; (ii) a 2003 federal income tax return signed by Able
and by Cooper as the preparer dated April 15, 2004, that reports Able’s gross income
from all sources for the year 2003 as $125,000; (iii)–(v) Able’s federal income tax
returns for prior years prepared by a New York accountant reporting gross income
for 2000 as $375,000; for 2001 as $410,000; and for 2002 as $275,000; (vi)–(vii)
cancelled checks from two law ﬁrms in New City showing payments to Able during
2003 aggregating $20,000 as consulting fees and bearing endorsements showing
that they were deposited in Able’s bank account during that year; (viii) a certiﬁed
copy of a divorce decree entered by the Supreme Court of New York indicating that
in 2000 Able agreed and the court ordered him to transfer assets with an aggregate
value of $750,000 to his wife Carol in full settlement of all claims she might have
arising from the marriage, for alimony or otherwise, and to pay the sum of $35,000
per year for the support of his two young children who remained in the custody of
Carol; (ix) a xerox copy of a love letter from Linda Davis to Able dated December
1, 2003, that includes the statement, “Remember, darling, what we talked about in
the disco – no risks, no me”; and (x) micro-ﬁlm copies of Able’s bank statements
and cancelled checks for the years 1999 through 2003.
In response to Able’s demand for discovery pursuant to constitutional and statu-
tory requirements, the government has also produced a copy of reports submitted
by FBI or IRS agents summarizing interviews with various witnesses. These include
a three-page memorandum by FBI Agent Dawes stating that he had interviewed
Timothy Cooper in August 2004 and that, among other things, Cooper had told him
that Cooper had merged his accounting practice in July 2004 and that his secretary
had lost or thrown out some materials, such as notes and work papers, contained in
inactive client-ﬁles. According to the memorandum, Cooper told Dawes that Able

25
was listed as an inactive client at the time because he had not consulted Cooper or
returned Cooper’s calls concerning preparation of Able’s 2004 income tax return.
Dawes’s memorandum reported that Cooper could not tell from examining the ﬁle
whether any materials from Able’s ﬁle had been discarded, but said he thought it
unlikely. Dawes’s memorandum reported that Cooper had no recollection of how
the signing of Able’s return was handled, but Cooper said that he usually mailed two
copies of a return to his clients with an envelope adressed to the Internal Revenue
Service and a note instructing them to review, sign, and mail the completed returns
by April 15. The memorandum reports that Cooper could not ﬁnd a copy of such
a note with the copy of Able’s 2003 return in his ﬁles. Cooper reported that the
ﬁle contains no information about any income other than Able’s salary, and that
Cooper did not recall Able informing him that he had received any other income.
Pursuant to the court’s reciprocal discovery requirement, Able has listed the
followingpossiblewitnesses:(i)JoanEvans,Able’spresentgirlfriend;(ii)KarlFrank,
dean of the New State University Law School; and (iii) various New State law
professorsandNewYorklawyerswhohaveworkedwithAbleduringhisprofessional
career, as possible character witnesses. Able has also produced for the government
a xerox copy of a handwritten note reading:
April 11, 2004
Dear Tim:
When we met last month, I gave you the information about my regular and
summer school salary from the law school and my expenses last year. As promised,
I have reviewed my bank records and notes and have determined that I received
$25,000 from my former New York law ﬁrm as my share of a contingent fee they
received on a case on which I had worked, and $20,000 for miscellaneous consulting
work I did for ﬁrms here in New City. Because I will be out of town on the 15th, I
have signed and enclosed a blank, undated 1040 form. I also enclose a signed check
payable to the Internal Revenue Service with the amount to be ﬁlled in by you. Please
complete, date, ﬁle, and send me a copy.
Regards,
Richard
Theﬁlealsocontainsmemorandabyyourpartnerbaseduponvariousinterviews.
These include a memorandum based upon notes from interviews with Able. The
principal points in that memorandum are as follows:
i Able spent 12 years with the Law Firm, seven as an associate, and ﬁve as a partner.
The tax returns for 1999, 2000, and 2001 were prepared by a New York accounting
ﬁrm that did the returns for all the Law Firm’s partners. They are accurate insofar as
Able knows.
ii Able left the ﬁrm in mid-2002 and joined the law faculty at New State University
where he is presently employed. In 2003, his salary for the academic year was
$105,000, and he was paid $20,000 for teaching in the summer quarter.
iii Able says he earned $20,000 for miscellaneous consulting work for New City ﬁrms.
The $25,000 check represented his share of a court-awarded fee in a case on which he
had worked while at the Law Firm.

Analysis of Evidence
iv Able says he retained Cooper in March 2004. He wrote the April letter just before he
left for a one-week trip to attend a conference in Chicago. According to Able he gave
the letter to his girlfriend, Joan Evans, and asked her to deliver it to Cooper after she
dropped him at the airport. Able said that he did not like Cooper, and he has since
done his own returns because they are rather simple.
v Able said that Baker disliked him because Able was one of the “young turk” partners
who had led the Law Firm into plaintiff’s litigation in which fees were contingent
upon results. The practice was eventually successful, but Baker was an old-timer who
thought that kind of practice was inconsistent with the Law Firm’s reputation as an
old-line corporate and banking ﬁrm.
vi Able acknowledged that he and his ex-wife Carol had been social cocaine users, and
he suspects Baker may try to suggest that Able was asked to leave the Law Firm for
this reason.
vii Able reported that as part of the settlement with Carol, she had waived any claim to
his retirement account containing $600,000 and that, after transfering assets valued
at $750,000 and paying his attorney’s fees and costs, he had about $150,000 in cash,
which he used to make a $100,000 down payment on a house he bought for $400,000
and to pay for moving expenses, for repairs and minor improvements to the house,
and for furniture and other furnishings for the house. Able acknowledged that he
made himself a promise when he entered practice that he would keep his pensions
intact until he retired.
viii Able admitted that he went to Las Vegas with his ex-girlfriend, Linda Davis, in
December 2003 in an effort to please her. He cashed the Law Firm check at a branch
of his bank as convenience to be sure he had the cash before Christmas. Able said
that he returned with more than $15,000 cash, he lent $6,000 to Linda as the down
payment for a small Porsche, spent the $2,500 on Christmas gifts for Linda and his
two children, and he used the balance for miscellaneous expenses in January and
February.
ix Able said that shortly after their return from Las Vegas, he learned that Linda had a
reputation as a heavy coke user and as a New City “call girl.” He said they broke up
when he asked her to sign a note for the $6,000 loan. According to Able, the breakup
was bitter and Linda has since refused to discuss the loan. Able said he thinks Linda
would say the $6,000 was a gift or would claim that he “blew” most of the $25,000 at
the tables in Las Vegas.
x According to Able, he has not used cocaine even socially since he began dating Joan
Evans because of her strong religious views. She works as a librarian and is still his
girlfriend.
The ﬁle also contains memoranda and notes from telephone and personal inter-
views indicating that:
i Joan Evans conﬁrms that she delivered the April 11 letter to Cooper’s ofﬁce and
handed it to his secretary who identiﬁed herself as Mrs. Cooper. She says that Able
is a brilliant lawyer and a good man and that he has never used cocaine in her
presence;

ii Baker hung up the telephone after commenting that Able’s taste for cocaine and fast
women had ﬁnally brought him his just reward;
iii Carol Able said she bore her ex-husband no ill will and would be happy to testify if it
would help; and
iv Cooper and Davis refused to discuss the matter.
Questions
1. Provisional theories of the case
a
What do you anticipate will be the government’s theory of the case in light of the
available evidence and your analysis? What will be its principal themes? Its story?
b
In light of that analysis and an analysis of the evidence available to you, what will be
the defendant’s theory of the case? The principal themes? The story?
2. Admissibility of the evidence
a
Trial preparation. The government has identiﬁed four substantive witnesses and nine
substantive documents through which it intends to prove its case.
i The government’s documents. In light of the provisional theories, to what fact of
consequence in the litigation will the government claim each document is
relevant? Which documents will you seek to exclude and on what basis? How
should counsel for the government respond, and what is the probable result?
ii The government’s witnesses. Are you likely to be able to exclude any testimony
concerning Able’s use of cocaine? What will the government argue and how will
you respond? How should the court rule? Are there other signiﬁcant lines of
testimony that the government is likely to seek to elicit that you would expect to
be able to exclude? If so, which, and on what bases?
b
The trial. The government has presented its case and rested. The court has denied
your motion for a directed verdict.
i On cross-examination, Cooper testiﬁed that he did not recall seeing Able’s
April 11th letter; that had his ofﬁce received it, it would have been in the client-ﬁle
he maintained for Able, and it is not; that his ﬁles were perfectly maintained; that
he does not recall discussing any papers being lost in his 2004 move; and that he
has never seen Agent Dawes’s memorandum and it does not refresh his
recollection. How will you proceed to impeach his credibility in your case in chief?
How will you respond to the government’s hearsay objections? Are you likely to
succeed?
ii Able has identiﬁed the April 11th letter and testiﬁed that he wrote and gave it to
Joan Evans to deliver it to Cooper. The government has objected to the admission
of the letter on the grounds that (1) its relevance has not been established; (2) it is
not the best evidence; and (3) it is inadmissible hearsay. How do you respond?
iii Apart from Able’s testimony concerning his conversations with Cooper and the
April 11th letter and Evans’s testimony concerning the delivery to Cooper’s ofﬁce,
what additional testimony will you seek to introduce through these or other
witnesses? Why? Does your answer depend upon whether you won or lost
objections you made during the government’s case? Explain.

Analysis of Evidence
3. The Nature of Proof
Would the application of the rules of evidence result in the exclusion of logically
relevant evidence? Would the exclusion of such evidence enhance the likelihood
that the jury would make a true determination? A just determination? Should the
case of United States v. Able be submitted to the jury? What does it mean to say
that a jury might ﬁnd that the evidence established Able’s guilt beyond and to the
exclusion of every reasonable doubt?
6. Sargent v. Southern Accident Co.4
You are a lawyer in private practice. Southern Accident Company has retained you
to defend it in an action by plaintiff Porter E. Sargent, beneﬁciary of a life insurance
policy issued by the company and covering his son Upham Sargent. The plaintiff
claims $500,000, the amount payable if the insured suffers an “accidental injury that
is the sole cause of death resulting within 90 days after the accidental injury.” The
policy excludes suicide, but not recklessness or engaging in hazardous activities. The
defendant company does not contend that the plaintiff’s proof of loss was not timely
or that the plaintiff failed to inform it in writing of all facts known or discovered
by plaintiff. However, the policy requires “written proof covering the occurrence,
character, and extent of the loss for which claim is made,” and the company takes
the position that the facts submitted to it fail to show that Upham Sargent died by
“accidental injury” within the provisions of the policy.
Pre-trial discovery proceedings have been completed and the company’s claims
supervisor is considering making a ﬁnal offer of settlement to plaintiff before trial.
In order to make that decision he has asked your opinion whether the plaintiff’s
evidence is sufﬁcient for the plaintiff to avoid a directed verdict in the defendant’s
favor, that is, whether there is sufﬁcient evidence from which a reasonable jury could
conclude that Upham Sargent suffered an “accidental injury that was the sole cause
of death resulting within 90 days after the accidental injury.”
Your answer will depend on your analysis of the evidence the plaintiff is likely
to offer at the trial. The plaintiff’s probable evidence, consisting of the testimony
of ﬁve witnesses, is set forth on the following pages. Assume that all ﬁve witnesses
will testify at the trial and that all will be credible. Assume the following standard
for decision: Could a jury of reasonable persons ﬁnd that the evidence presented
satisﬁed the test on a “balance of probabilities”?
Plaintiff’s Evidence
Testimony of Porter E. Sargent. The insured was my son, Upham Sargent. When
he died he was 21 years old. He was ﬁnancially comfortable, mentally well bal-
anced, vigorous, athletic, resourceful, courageous, a good swimmer, and of some
experience in living in wild country without provisions. For several years he had
taken hazardous and adventurous journeys alone in this country and in Europe.

Upham had ﬁnished his junior year in college in the spring of 2002. He lived with
my wife and myself in our home in Boston until August, 2002, when he left to go
on a kayak trip in northern Quebec. Before leaving he outlined to me the trip from
Boston via Montreal to Senneterre. From Senneterre he planned to travel by kayak
to Mattagami Lake at the head of the Nottaway River. His intention was to run down
the river in his kayak in a northwesterly direction, into James Bay, and to go to a
trading post of the Hudson’s Bay Company on James Bay, called Rupert’s House.
He left Boston on a train for Montreal on August 1, 2002. He traveled with a green
kayak. The boat was eighteen feet long and not as deep as a canoe. He transported
the kayak in the baggage car of the train. The kayak had the name “Sargent” burned
into the wood inside its stern. When he left Boston he also had with him a small
repeating riﬂe with ammunition, a sleeping robe, matches, $800 in money, snares
and ﬁshing tackle, and a good supply of food. He had no clothes for winter weather.
His mother and I said goodbye to him at North Station in Boston on August 1,
2002. We never saw him again.
Testimony of George Birdsong. I live on an Indian reservation at the northern reaches
of the Nottaway River, near its mouth. We are friendly and hospitable Indians, who
live by trapping and selling the skins at Rupert’s House. The Indians who live at
Mattagami Lake are equally friendly and hospitable. They trade at Senneterre, to the
south. The Nottaway River varies from a ﬁfth to a half-mile in width and consists
of a series of dangerous rapids among large boulders. The river falls about seven
hundred feet in its course. The only possible channel through rapids is usually near
one bank or the other. In that river if one should not ﬁnd the channel he could not
cross to the other side. An upset in the river would probably mean death. Even the
best canoeists would ﬁnd that river very hazardous. Only three parties are known
to have descended it safely. The customary route from Mattagami Lake to Rupert’s
House is much longer and avoids the Nottaway River. There are no portages, roads,
trails, or paths in the country drained by the river. That country is ﬂat, desolate,
and unforested, with many swamps and with no elevations of consequence. Fish
and blueberries are plentiful, and there are some ducks and rabbits.
IwasvisitingfriendsandworkingonthereservationatMattagamiLakeinAugust
and September, 2002. I met Upham Sargent when he came there about September
1, 2002. He told me he was going down the Nottaway River in his kayak. I had never
heard of anyone trying to go down the Nottaway River in a kayak. I warned him
that the trip would be very dangerous. Sargent stayed in the Mattagami reservation
until September 8. That day I saw him load his supplies and belongings into the
kayak, get into the kayak and set off down the river. I never saw him again.
In October, 2002, I found his paddle on the bank of the Nottaway River, on the
fringe of a whirlpool 50 or 60 miles from the mouth of the river.
Testimony of Henry Largetree. I live near the Nottaway River. I never met Upham
Sargent. In May 2003 I found the bow section of a green kayak under some rocks
in the Nottaway River. The place was about 40 miles from the river’s mouth.

Analysis of Evidence
Testimony of Clarence Rockbound. I am a senior geologist in the service of the Cana-
dian Government. Among my duties are preparing topographical surveys of various
localities in Canada. I have surveyed the area of the Nottaway River. The length of
the river from the head of the Nottaway River in Lake Mattagami to its mouth is
225 kilometers (140 miles). I prepared the “Nottaway Sheet” of the geological sur-
vey of Canada. I have never travelled through the rapids of the Nottaway River, but
from my studies and work in the region I have acquired a general knowledge of the
character of the river and the region through which it ﬂows. I have descended the
rapids of another river a little north of the Nottaway in a canoe. It is my opinion
that an individual in a kayak loaded with supplies could not descend the Nottaway
River without being drowned. In my opinion based upon my experience, a kayak
managed by one person and carrying a load cannot stay aﬂoat in the quick water
of great power that ﬂows among the boulders of the Nottaway River. I also have
an opinion that it would be possible that in an upset the person would lose his
kayak and all his equipment and, though he might reach the shore safely, he would
eventually starve to death. At the same time I believe from my knowledge of the
Nottaway River area that there were plenty of blueberries there in September and
October, 2002, on which one could live for a month.
Testimony of Sergeant Horatio Renfrew. I am a sergeant in the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police. I was in charge of coordinating the search efforts for Upham
Sargent. Search parties were organized by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the
Hudson’s Bay Company, Revillon Freres Ltd., the Indians of the Nottaway River
neighborhood, and other persons in the north country. The searches were made
during the period from September 20, 2002 to February 28, 2003. I personally made
an airplane ﬂight in February 2003 over the northern reaches of the Nottaway River
in the hope of sighting Upham Sargent or his body. I have never found him or his
body. All of the other search parties reported to me that they had not found Sargent
or his body. On March 1, 2003, I instructed them to discontinue the search.
Questions
1 What is the ultimate proposition of fact, the ultimate probandum, that the plaintiff
must prove in order to prevail? State the proposition. How many conditions must be
satisﬁed? State each condition as a simple proposition.
2 Analyze all of the plaintiff’s evidence to determine whether it is sufﬁcient to avoid a
directed verdict in the defendant’s favor. Prepare a concise outline identifying as a
separate proposition each relevant fact that can be shown by the testimony. State as
separate propositions the relevant inferences that can be drawn from these evidential
propositions. Complete the analysis by organizing the data in a manner that compels
the conclusion that the plaintiff does or does not have sufﬁcient evidence to satisfy all
of the conditions required by the ultimate proposition that he must prove, that is, to
prove each of the material facts in issue.

3 Identify each testimonial proposition that you believe would not be admissible as
evidence under the rules of evidence. State why that evidence is inadmissible and
identify the rule of evidence that supports each conclusion. Identify only those
propositions that you conclude are inadmissible. Would the exclusion of this evidence
affect the result of your analysis under question 2? For each proposition excluded,
would the exclusion promote the search for truth? If not what other policies are
served by the exclusion?
7. Whose baby II? Morrison v. Jenkins 80 C.L.R. 626 (Aust. 1949)
[Melbourne, Oct. 13, 14, 17, 18; Dec. 22. Latham C.J., Rich, Dixon, McTiernan and
Webb JJ.]
[In proceedings to obtain the custody of a child, the applicants, Mr. and Mrs. M., alleged
that there had been a confusion of identity between their child and that of Mr. and Mrs.
J. at the hospital at which the two children were born at about the same time and that
each mother had been given the child of the other. They accordingly sought an order
for custody of the child which was – and had been for some four years – in the custody
of Mr. and Mrs. J. The primary judge found that the child was in fact that of Mr. and
Mrs. M., and he ordered that they have the custody of the child.
Held, by RICH, DIXON and WEBB JJ. (LATHAM C.J. and MCTIERNAN J. dis-
senting) that the order should be set aside because, per RICH and DIXON JJ., the
evidence left the parentage of the child so much in doubt that it would not be for the
child’s welfare to remove it from its present custody: per WEBB J. (LATHAM C.J. and
MCTIERNAN J. contra), the evidence as a whole did not warrant the conclusion of the
primary judge that the child belonged to the appellants.]
Decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria (Full Court), (1949) V.L.R. 277
afﬁrmed . . .
LATHAM C.J. On 22nd June 1945 a baby girl was born to Mrs. Alberta Gwen
Morrison in the labour ward at the Kyneton Hospital in Victoria. Within the preceding
ﬁve minutes a baby girl had been born in the same ward to Mrs. Jessie Jenkins. Mrs.
Morrison and her husband claim that the baby known as Nola Jenkins, who has lived
with the Jenkins family ever since Mrs. Jenkins left the hospital, is her (Mrs. Morrison’s)
baby and that the girl known as Johanne Lee Morrison who was given to Mrs. Morrison
at the hospital as her baby is not in fact her child. Mr. and Mrs. Morrison took pro-
ceedings against Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins by way of habeas corpus, claiming the custody
of Nola . . .
The case for Mr. and Mrs. Morrison was supported by their own afﬁdavits and by
afﬁdavitsofMrs.AmeliaWilliams(Mrs.Morrison’smother),Dr.DouglasJohnThomas
andDr.LucyMeredithBryce–clinicalpathologistshighlyskilledinthemakingofblood

afﬁdavits in reply, as also did Sister Lockhart and Sister Cass of the Kyneton Hospital.
These two nurses attended upon the occasion of the conﬁnement of the two ladies,
Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins. The parties, the nurses and Dr. Lucy Bryce were cross-
examined upon their afﬁdavits. An afﬁdavit by Dr. Gerald Loughran, who delivered

Analysis of Evidence
both children, was also ﬁled on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins. Dr. Loughran at the
time of the trial was absent in Singapore and was not available for cross-examination.
The learned trial judge examined the evidence in detail and approached the question
of the parentage of Nola by asking four questions, which were as follows: – “1. Was the
female child to which Mrs. Morrison gave birth on June 22, 1945, in the labour ward of
the Kyneton District Hospital the offspring of the union between her and her husband
William Henry Morrison? 2. Was the female child that was brought to Mrs. Morrison
before she left the labour ward the female child to which she had given birth about
half an hour earlier? 3. If the female child so brought to her was not the child to which
she had given birth, was there an opportunity for a mistake to be made by which some
other female child could have been substituted for the child to which she had given
birth? 4. If there was such an opportunity, what other child could have been mistakenly
substituted for the child to which Mrs. Morrison had given birth?”
The answers which his Honour gave to these questions were as follows: 1. Yes;
2. No; 3. Yes; 4. Johanne Lee. Bearing in mind the gravity of the issues before the Court,
his Honour was thoroughly convinced that Nola was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Morrison and, after considering what course of action would be for the welfare of Nola,
he made an order that Nola should be delivered up to Mr. and Mrs. Morrison, and that
they should have custody of her.
As to some matters there is no room for doubt. In the ﬁrst place, it is established
beyond question that a female child was born to Mrs. Morrison in the Kyneton Hospital
on 22nd June 1945.
In the second place, I regard it as also completely established that that child (whoever
she was) was the issue of Mr. and Mrs. Morrison. Mrs. Morrison gave evidence that she
had never had sexual intercourse with any person other than her husband. She was not
cross-examined upon this matter. The learned trial judge believed her evidence. There
is in my opinion no ground whatever for suggesting at this stage in the proceedings
that Mrs. Morrison had been unchaste and that the child which was born to her was
not the child of her husband.
The three separate sets of blood tests applied to Mr. and Mrs. Morrison and Johanne
Lee show, according to the uncontradicted scientiﬁc evidence, that the child Johanne
Lee, although she might be the child of Mrs. Morrison, cannot possibly be the child of
Mr. and Mrs. Morrison. This proposition has not been challenged at any step of the
case. The scientiﬁc evidence on this point is conclusive . . .
Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins submitted an afﬁdavit by Dr. Loughran (who could not be
cross-examined) to the effect that he made blood tests of them and of Nola and that
according to his recollection the tests showed that Nola could be their child. They
declined to have any further tests made by the highly-qualiﬁed experts who were avail-
able. No evidence was given by any witness to the effect that Dr. Loughran’s evidence,
even if completely accepted, showed or even tended to show that Nola actually was
the child of Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins or that she could not be the child of Mr. and Mrs.
Morrison. It is established that Johanne Lee is the child which was brought to Mrs.
Morrison within not more than half an hour of the birth of her child and is the child
which has been in her custody ever since. It is therefore clear that a mistake was made
in the hospital and that Mrs. Morrison was given the wrong baby . . .

Sisters Cass and Lockhart gave evidence to the effect that before the two babies were
born to Mrs. Jenkins and Mrs. Morrison either two cots containing clothes marked with
the names of the mothers or one cot containing such garments was in the labour ward.
The learned trial judge rejected this and other evidence of the nurses and accepted the
evidence of Mrs. Morrison. He also accepted the evidence of Mrs. Morrison that the
two babies were taken out of the labour ward at the same time in the arms of Sister
Atkinson. I cannot see how a court of appeal could justify a reversal of the decision
of the learned judge with reference to evidence of this character by believing evidence
which the learned judge had rejected by reason of his opinion of the credibility of the
witnesses. But, in any case, the evidence as to whether there were two cots or only one
cot in the ward and where any cot was in the ward and as to whether Sister Atkinson
took the babies out in her arms or otherwise is on the margin of the case.
The ﬁndings of the learned trial judge as to the credibility of the evidence of the
various witnesses were hardly challenged. Upon appeal, though not at the trial, consid-
erable attention was directed to evidence given by Mrs. Williams, the mother of Mrs.
Morrison, that on the day when the children were born she was shown a baby by Sister
Lockhart as being Mrs. Morrison’s child and that that child had a fair complexion.
Johanne Lee has a dark complexion. This evidence appears to me to be unimportant.
Whether the evidence of Mrs. Williams is accepted or not, it leaves untouched the
certain conclusion that Johanne Lee is not Mrs. Morrison’s baby. Sister Lockhart may
have shown Mrs. Williams the right baby, but even if the conclusion arose at a later time
than that found by the learned trial judge, it still leaves for determination the problem
of the identiﬁcation of Mrs. Morrison’s child . . .
Johanne Lee was substituted for the baby born to Mrs. Morrison. The question for
determination is whether Nola was Mrs. Morrison’s baby for whom Johanne Lee was
substituted. The circumstances of the two births, which were practically simultaneous,
the fact that Sister Atkinson had no midwifery experience as to tagging babies with
some identifying label, that the two babies were taken out of the ward together by Sister
Atkinson to be bathed by Sister Lockhart, wrapped up in some wrapper provided by
the hospital, though possibly also with bunny rugs round them, that there was only one
bath in which to bathe them, that the baby which was brought to Mrs. Morrison half an
hour after birth as her baby was unclothed, wearing no identifying garments, that the
learned trial judge did not accept the evidence of the nurses that there were cots in the
ward tagged with the names Morrison and Jenkins, that there was every opportunity
for confusion between the Morrison and Jenkins babies, and the most important fact
that Johanne Lee is not the child of Mr. and Mrs. Morrison, so that Mrs. Morrison got
the wrong baby, all go to support the conclusion that the Jenkins baby was by mistake
given to Mrs. Morrison.
But it was argued that two other female children were born in the hospital at about
the same time, namely to Mrs. Hayes on 19th June and to Mrs. Perry on 20th June, and
thatoneofthesebabiesmighthavebeensubstitutedforthebabyborntoMrs.Morrison.
Mrs. Morrison’s baby was born on 22nd June. Sister Lockhart gave evidence that she did
not think it was possible to mix up a newly-born baby with a baby who was even only
twenty-four hours old. This evidence was apparently accepted at the trial by all parties
as obviously true. No cross-examination was directed against it. The Hayes baby was

Analysis of Evidence
about three days and the Perry baby about two days older than Mrs. Morrison’s child.
No evidence was given to support the speculation that Mrs. Morrison’s baby was given
to Mrs. Hayes or Mrs. Perry or that she was given one of their babies. In my opinion
there was ample evidence to support the ﬁnding of the learned trial judge that Nola is
the child of Mrs. Morrison . . .
RICH J. . . . Moreover, there is real doubt whether Nola is the child of the Morrisons
and this is another factor to be taken into consideration in determining the issue of
welfare. I am not satisﬁed that the scientiﬁc evidence is infallible. At most it goes to
show that Johanne Lee is not the child of the Morrison union. But it neither shows nor
purports to show that Nola Jenkins is the child of that union although it does show that
Johanne Lee could be the child of Mrs. Morrison. On this issue the appellants must
exclude every other reasonable hypothesis. Did a mistake in fact occur? The evidence
of Mrs. Williams is inconsistent with that of her daughter, the female appellant, and
is also inconsistent with the ﬁnding of the learned primary judge that the exchange of
babies occurred shortly after birth. Moreover at the time of the alleged mistake two
other recently born babies – the Perry and Hayes children – were born on the 19th and
20th June in the same nursery in the same hospital. The appellants had no evidence as to
these children or their mothers or that either mother had ever seen her child before the
morning of 22nd June. In these circumstances the possibility of a mistake with either of
these children cannot be excluded. Thus the probability of a mistake with the Jenkins’
child to the exclusion of any other is considerably lessened, if, indeed, a mistake did
in fact occur. A decision as to parentage will not bind the child and at a later stage in
other proceedings – for example under a will or settlement in which the child should
be a party [to] a decision contrary to that in the instant case would be a grievous blow
to the happiness and welfare of the child. Indeed in a proceeding to which the child is
not a party the Court has no jurisdiction to decide a question of legitimacy . . .
DIXON J. . . . The inference that Nola is the child of the Morrisons rests of course
wholly on circumstantial evidence. Notwithstanding the wealth of detail gone into,
particularly as to the circumstances of the birth of the two children, the whole case
depends upon a chain consisting of a very few evidentiary facts or circumstances and
some steps in reasoning which together are relied upon as warranting the inference.
The ﬁrst of these facts or steps is the conclusion deposed to by scientiﬁc witnesses that
Johanne Lee belongs to a blood group that is inconsistent with her being the child of
Mr. Morrison. This conclusion the Jenkins are powerless to deny. The second step is
the inference that she is therefore not the child of Mrs. Morrison. Any other inference
would reﬂect upon Mrs. Morrison and the Jenkins make no such reﬂection. The third
is the fact that from the time that Mrs. Morrison left the hospital with a girl child and
until the scientists took the blood tests there has been no change in the identity of that
child and she is Johanne Lee and was the child submitted to the blood tests. This fact
is proved by the Morrisons. Nothing of course could be more probable and it may be
accepted as possessing as much certainty as attaches to the proof of any fact in human
affairs. But as it is an essential step in the reasoning it must not be omitted. The fourth
step is proof that at the hospital where both women were conﬁned there was a real
chance of confusion between the female child which Mrs. Morrison bore and some

35
other female child. The ﬁfth step is the elimination of the possibility that any other
child but Mrs. Jenkins’ could have been attributed to Mrs. Morrison. The sixth step is
the inference that correspondingly Mrs. Jenkins must have received Mrs. Morrison’s
child.
By this chain of reasoning the result that Nola is Mrs. Morrison’s child is said to
be established. To make good the last three steps a great deal of evidence was adduced
at the hearing. The events of the morning of 22nd June 1945 when both women were
delivered of female children within ten or ﬁfteen minutes in the same labour ward were
inquired into in great detail. I should have thought that neither nurses nor patients
could be expected to observe or recall so much and that their attempts to reconstruct
the incidents of the morning could not safely be relied upon. But two conclusions
emerge which are clear enough. One is that there was no routine for identifying babies
which excluded the possibility of mistake and the other is that because two women were
delivered by the same doctor and nursing staff in the same ward within such a short
time there was a greater liability to confusion.
But in my opinion the further inference or conclusions which have been drawn as to
the precise manner in which the babies were handled and exactly by whom are doubtful
and in some respects speculative and they are unsafe.
Two other recently born female children were in the hospital, one born on 20th and
the other on 19th of June. It does not appear whether they were full-term children nor
was the condition of the mothers or any other circumstances proved really relevant
to the possibility or impossibility, likelihood or unlikelihood, of the confusion (if one
took place) being with either of those children. The case for the Morrisons naturally
was that their child was confused with the Jenkins’ child immediately after the birth
of the children. That was the view which Barry J. adopted and acted upon. But Mrs.
Morrison’s mother, who visited the hospital later on the same day, in the afternoon,
said that she was shown a child as her daughter’s which was not the child her daughter
brought home from the hospital. The tendency of her evidence if it were correct was
to show a confusion at some later time and not as a result of the birth of two children
at nearly the same time in the same ward. There would therefore be little or no reason
to suppose that the confusion was with Mrs. Jenkins’ child rather than with one of the
other two girl babies.
The only further fact I shall mention is that little or nothing is known concerning the
blood grouping of the Jenkins and Nola. They submitted themselves to their medical
adviser for a blood test and he reported that it disclosed that Nola might be their child,
that is that their blood grouping was consistent with their being the parents of Nola.
He made an afﬁdavit to that effect but he was abroad and not available for cross-
examination. The Jenkins declined to submit themselves and the child to further blood
tests . . .
With any chain of circumstantial evidence the chances of error in the conclusion
arise ﬁrst from the chances of error in each fact or consideration forming the steps
and second from the chance of error in reasoning to the conclusion from the whole of
those facts and considerations. It is therefore wrong to take each fact or consideration
separately, to assess the possibilities of error in ﬁnding it is established and then if you

Analysis of Evidence
think it should be found afterwards to treat it as a certainty and pass to the next fact or
consideration and so on to the conclusion. The possibilities of error at all points must
be combined and assessed together.
In the present case I think that when all the possibilities are taken into account
there is too much uncertainty in the inference that Nola is the child of Mr. and Mrs.
Morrison to warrant an order taking her from Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins and placing her in
the custody of Mr. and Mrs. Morrison. It was a sound exercise of the discretion of the
Supreme Court to leave her in the custody of Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins . . .
McTIERNAN J. . . . The evidence proves that the child born to Mrs. Morrison on
22nd June 1945 in the labour ward of the Kyneton District Hospital was begotten by
her husband. This fact is an irresistible inference from the evidence, given by Mrs.
Morrison, that she never had sexual intercourse with any man other than her husband.
Barry J. believed this evidence. There is no ground upon which an appeal court could
properly decide that his Honour erred in believing this evidence or why the Court itself
should disbelieve it or suspect that the child born to Mrs. Morrison was not begotten by
her husband. The scientiﬁc evidence of the blood tests, the validity and the reliability of
whichareestablishedbytheevidence,provesthatJohanneLee,achildunderthecustody
of the appellants, could be the child of Mrs. Morrison but not of her and her husband.
TheevidencefurtherprovesthatJohanneLeeisthebabywhowasgiventoMrs.Morrison
after she had given birth to a child at the above-mentioned time and place, upon the
supposition that it was the child to which she had given birth; she was the child whom
Mrs. Morrison took with her from the hospital when she returned to her home.
These facts establish beyond any reasonable doubt that Mrs. Morrison was given a
baby to which she did not give birth and the baby is Johanne Lee.
The next crucial question is when was the mistake made at the hospital which led to
the substitution of Johanne Lee for the baby to which Mrs. Morrison gave birth. The
answer to this question is that the mistake was made within half an hour of the birth
of Mrs. Morrison’s own child. This fact is proved by the following evidence elicited by
the cross-examination of Mrs. Morrison: – Q. “May we take it that that was the baby
that was brought back to you within half an hour at the outside of its birth and that
you took away with you when you ultimately left the hospital? – Yes.” Q. “So that, if any
mistake was made, in the transposition of these babies, it was prior to that time? – Yes.”
Barry J. accepted this evidence. It proved that the result of the mistake was complete
before the afternoon of 22nd June. Mrs. Morrison’s baby was then in the possession of
some other woman.
In the light of this fact, Mrs. Williams’ evidence, to which importance was attached
in the Full Court, can have but small signiﬁcance. It probably provides the reason why
Barry J. paid no attention to Mrs. Williams’ evidence (a fact noticed in the Full Court);
she was not cross-examined. Mrs. Williams is Mrs. Morrison’s mother; her evidence is
in an afﬁdavit ﬁled in support of the appellant’s application.
To whom was the baby born to Mrs. Morrison given?
The evidence proves that the parturitions of Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins
occurred at the same time and place and their babies were born within ﬁve to ten
minutes of each other: their simultaneous parturitions created an emergency described
in the evidence, arrangements had to be made quickly to cope with it.

The evidence further proves that in this hospital a female baby was born on 19th June
1945; and another female baby was born on 20th June 1945.
Assuming that each of these babies was born at the latest point of time to make
those dates respectively their birthdays, then on the morning of 22nd June, when
Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins gave birth to their babies, the ﬁrst of the two other
babies would then be ﬁfty-ﬁve hours old, and the second thirty-one hours old. If either
was born at an earlier hour she would of course be older.
It is reasonably certain that before the morning of 22nd June these older babies
would have been placed under the usual routine of a baby’s life. They would have been
more than once bathed, dressed, fed, and have been in the possession of their mother.
It is hardly probable that either would at that stage of her life have been placed with a
woman not her mother.
Sister Lockhart, a double-certiﬁcated nurse, said in the course of her evidence that
she did not think it was possible to mix up a newly-born baby with a baby forty-eight
hours old.
It is less probable that confusion could have taken place between Mrs. Morrison’s
baby and one of the older babies, than between her baby and Mrs. Jenkins’ baby. The
births of their babies were almost contemporaneous.
Barry J. found that a nurse carried them out, one on each arm, from the labour ward
to the nursery to be bathed, and they were left unattended until Sister Lockhart bathed
them.
The ﬁeld within which the mistake could occur, upon any reasonable view, must be
limitedtothetwomothersandthetwobabieswhowerealltogetherinthecomparatively
small labour ward, receiving the attention of the doctor and nurses: these two mothers
and babies were involved in the same set of circumstances . . .
There is no evidence which could raise a doubt that the members of the hospital
staff did give each of the babies born on 19th June and 20th June respectively to her
mother. It is not a probable hypothesis that Mrs. Morrison’s baby was exchanged for
one of those babies, upon a reasonable view of the circumstances . . .
Mrs. Morrison said that the child brought to her within half an hour of the birth
was dark and unclad and was the child she took home with her. Mrs. Williams said the
baby shown to her on that afternoon and which a member of the nursing staff told her
was her daughter’s baby was a fairskinned baby and resembled Mrs. Morrison’s other
children. This incident might possess signiﬁcance only if Mrs. Morrison was present.
She was not present . . .
WEBB J. . . . If there had been only two infants in the Kyneton District Hospital on
22nd June, 1945, namely those born on that day, this Court would, I think, be obliged
to restore the judgment of Barry J. and give the custody of Nola to the Morrisons as
their child. The onus of proof was on the Morrisons, but the credibility of witnesses was
for the learned judge to determine. His Honour believed Mrs. Morrison when she said
that the child born to her on 22nd June, 1945, was by her husband, and he naturally
acceptedtheevidenceofthebloodteststhatJohannewasnotachildbyMr.Morrison.So
he could properly have concluded that Nola was the child of the Morrisons, if there were
only the two infants in the hospital on 22nd June, 1945. The same result would follow
if it had been common ground that Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins each received a

Analysis of Evidence
newly-born baby on the morning of 22nd June, 1945. Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins
each claim to have received a newly-born infant that day. Mrs. Morrison contends
that Mrs. Jenkins did receive a newly-born baby, because Mrs. Morrison is claiming
Nola from Mrs. Jenkins. But the case for Mrs. Jenkins is that if Mrs. Morrison did not
get her own baby, she got one of the older babies born on 19th and 20th June, 1945,
and not the baby of Mrs. Jenkins. The conduct of the proceedings and the judgment
indicate that there was no common ground that Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Jenkins each
received a newly-born baby. Sister Lockhart, who made an afﬁdavit on behalf of Mr.
and Mrs. Jenkins, was cross-examined with a view to showing that Mrs. Morrison’s
child was not given to one of the mothers of the two older infants born on 19th and
20th June, 1945, and the judgment gives ground for holding why Mrs. Morrison’s child
was not given to one of these two mothers, namely, an assumption by his Honour as
to the ability of mothers generally to recognize their infants, and the evidence of Sister
Lockhart as to the impossibility in ordinary circumstances of mixing up a newly-born
baby with one twenty-four hours old.
Part of the cross-examination of Sister Lockhart was as follows: – “Is there much
difference between a newly-born baby and a baby twenty-four hours old from the point
of view of telling the difference to a nurse or a mother? . . . Sometimes there is. Are they
any more likely, and better developed, any different characteristics? . . . Oh! the features
settle a bit sometimes. Would you think it possible to mix up a newly-born baby with
a baby twenty-four hours old? . . . I don’t think so.”
These questions suggest the possibility that the infant born on 20th June was born
about midnight of that date. Of course the baby born on 20th June was at least thirty-
one hours older than the babies born about 7 a.m. on 22nd June; but the older the baby
is the less likely is it to be mistaken for a newly-born baby.
His Honour in his judgment under the heading “What other child could have been
substituted for Mrs. Morrison’s?” says: – “It appears that between the 19th June 1945
and 22nd June 1945, four female children were born at the Kyneton District Hospital.
A female child was born on the 19th, another on the 20th and the two children, the
circumstances of whose births have been examined, on the 22nd. It was submitted by
Mr. Hudson that the evidence did not exclude the possibility that some baby other than
Mrs. Jenkins’ child may have been mistakenly exchanged for Mrs. Morrison’s baby. I do
not think there is any substance in this submission. It appears to me most unlikely that
a mother of a child born on the 19th or 20th would fail to detect a mistake if a child
born on the 22nd were brought to her. Moreover, Sister Lockhart was asked: ’Would
you think it possible to mix up a newly-born baby with a baby twenty-four hours old?’
and she answered, ‘I don’t think so.’ If this be excluded as a possibility the ﬁndings of
fact I have set forth earlier leave open only one conclusion, and it is that the only baby
that could have been exchanged for Mrs. Morrison’s baby was the baby born to Mrs.
Jenkins.”
Neither the cross-examination of Sister Lockhart nor the judgment of Barry J. deal
with the actual condition of the two mothers of the older infants or the appearance of
those infants. It is conﬁned to mothers and infants generally. There was no evidence to
show the actual condition of these two mothers on 22nd June. Neither may have been
in a condition to receive or to recognize her infant. Further there was no evidence that

39
neither of the two older infants could have been mistaken on 22nd June for a newly-
born infant. Either or both could have been prematurely born. There was no evidence
to the contrary. It is not a matter of common knowledge that under no circumstances
could a baby two or three days old be mistaken for a newly-born infant. Sister Lockhart
said twice that sometimes there is a noticeable difference before saying she did not
think it possible to mix up a newly-born baby with a baby twenty-four hours old; that
is, of course, if both mothers and both infants are normal at the time of the exchange,
in which event no evidence is really necessary to show a mistake would not be likely
to occur. I do not think that any presumption arose that the other two mothers and
infants were normal, or that the Morrisons had given enough evidence, as a result of
getting these obvious answers from Sister Lockhart, to shift the onus of proof to Mr.
and Mrs. Jenkins that one of the two other mothers or one of the two older infants was
not normal in condition or appearance on 22nd June, 1945. The onus of proof is not
shifted by a mere statement of what is common knowledge. Although Mrs. Morrison
had ether administered to her at the birth of her child on 22nd June she appears to have
been in a normal condition when she received Johanne; but if Johanne was prematurely
born on 20th June, or even on the 19th, she might have appeared newly-born on 22nd
June . . .
Questions
1 Frame the ultimate proposition that the Morrisons would have had to have proven in
order to satisfy the judges of the High Court. From the portions of their opinions
included here, was each judge assessing the evidence and inferences against the same
ultimate probandum? If not, how many different versions of the ultimate probandum
were used? Was each judge applying the same standard of review?
2 In all, ten afﬁdavits were submitted and seven witnesses were cross-examined on their
afﬁdavits. Which direct assertions by afﬁdavit or on cross-examination were disputed
or contradicted at trial? Which were undisputed and uncontradicted?
3 All judges (or all but one) agree that “It was a baby other than the baby known as
Johanne Lee Morrison that was the baby borne by Mrs. Morrison.” This is an
inference critical to the case. What evidential data (here assertions by afﬁdavit or by
testimony) are relevant to this inference? Do these data directly support this inference,
or are there intermediate inferences that must be made? How do the data and any
intermediate inferences combine to support this inference? The judges agreed upon
the conclusion that the evidence supported this inference, but is the reasoning by
which each reached that conclusion the same?
4 Latham, C.J., and McTiernan, J., thought the evidence provided by Mrs. Williams
“unimportant.” Rich and Dixon, J.J., attached considerable signiﬁcance to it. What is
the inference that Mrs. Williams’s assertions can be argued to have established that is
relevant to the case? How does that inference undermine the argument that the
evidence proved that “It was Nola who was the baby born to Mrs. Morrison”?
5 In light of the evidence, how conﬁdent are you that Nola was the natural child of

8. An investigation: basic concepts in analysis and evaluation
You are a police cadet in Jonesville on your very ﬁrst assignment. A report of what
sounds like a murder has just been received. A team has been sent out to investigate.
Youhavebeeninstructedtoreceiveandorganizeallinformationpotentiallyrelevant
to the investigation as it comes in from various sources. From time to time you will
beaskedtomakeprovisionalevaluationsofthedata.Youwillalsobeaskedtoanswer
some “academic” questions as part of your training.
A
It is reported that:
1 Y was murdered in his home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1st.
2 W1 says that she saw a person with characteristics, a, b, c, and d enter Y’s home at
4:15 p.m. on January 1st.
3 X has characteristics a, b, c, and d.
Assuming that each of these propositions is true, answer the following questions:
a
Do you suspect that, “It was X who murdered Y” (probandum A, hereinafter “Pa”)?
b
Are propositions 2 and 3 relevant to Pa?
c
Do propositions 2 and 3 prove Pa to be true on the balance of probabilities?
d
Can you infer from W1’s statement that X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.?
Give reasons for your answers.
B
Deduction. Using not more than 12 further evidential propositions (such as, W2
says that he saw X strike Y at 4:20 p.m.) in each instance:
i Construct an argument proving that it was necessarily the case that “It was X who
murdered Y.”

41
ii Construct an argument proving that it was necessarily the case that “It was not X who
murdered Y.”
C
You now have the following additional data:
4 W2 says that he saw X, who was known to him, running out of Y’s home at 4:45 p.m.
on January 1st.
5 W2 says that X was in a state of great agitation.
6 W3 says that he overheard X on Christmas Day say angrily to Y: “I shall not forget this.”
7 A forensic laboratory report states that hairs found on a chair in the room in which
Y’s body was found are almost certainly X’s.
On the basis of propositions 1 to 7, indicate which of the following most closely
approximates your current state of belief (select one):
a
It is possible that X murdered Y.
b
It is more likely than not that X murdered Y.
c
The odds are 3 to 1 that X murdered Y.
d
It is established beyond reasonable doubt that X murdered Y.
e
I do not have any belief about Pa.
Give reasons for your answer.
D
You now have the following additional data. What difference does each proposition
make to the judgment you made in (C)? Consider each item ﬁrst on its own and
then in combination with each and then all of the other items:
8 W3, who is X’s brother, says that he saw X enter Y’s home about 4:05 p.m. on
January 1st.
9 W4 says that he was observing Y’s home between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. on January 1st
and that a person who had characteristics a, b, and d was the only person he saw
enter and the only person he saw leave during this period.
10 There is no record that X has ever committed a crime of violence.
11 X has two convictions for shoplifting; the most recent occurred ﬁve years ago.
Indicate the current state of your belief after considering each of these propo-
sitions in connection with propositions 1 to 7. State brieﬂy how each of the new
items of information and all of them combined affect your belief.

E
Further data. What difference does it make to your state of belief about Pa based on
propositions 1 to 11 if one of the following items of information is added to your
data? Consider each separately and in combination with the others.
12 X claims to have been in a house ﬁve miles from the scene of the murder between
2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on January 1st.
13 Z states that she was with X in a house ﬁve miles from the murder between 4 p.m. and
4:24 p.m. on January 1st.
14 A new pathologist’s report suggests that Y might have died at any time between 2 p.m.
and 6 p.m. on January 1st.
15 The same report suggests that the cause of death was probably a blow with a blunt
instrument, but could have been from natural causes (such as from striking his head
on a table as he fell), but this seems unlikely. No blunt instrument has been found on
the premises.
Give reasons for your answers.
F
Ancillary evidence (evidence about evidence). What difference does it make to your
state of belief about Pa based on propositions 1 to 15 if one of the following items
of information is added to your data? Consider each separately and in combination
with the others.
16 W1 is a bank manager?
17 W2 is very short-sighted?
18 W2 is Y’s brother and stands to beneﬁt ﬁnancially from Y’s death?
19 W1 seemed to be very nervous and hesitant when questioned by the police?
20 W3 is a licensed private investigator?
21 Z is a prostitute?
a In what respect or respects is the information about W1, W2, W3, W4, and Z relevant
to an assessment of that witness’s credibility? Be speciﬁc.
b Is any of these witnesses likely to be biased?
c How is the new information relevant to your assessment of the likelihood of Pa?
Give reasons for your answers.
G
Revise your judgment about Pa in the light of the following background information;
in each case consider the item separately and then jointly with all the other items
in this section.

22 X is female.
23 X is a 65-year-old volunteer social worker.
24 Y was X’s son.
25 Y’s “home” was an apartment in a building with 20 apartments.
26 Y’s home was in an apartment building with three separate entrances.
27 At an identiﬁcation parade (line-up) held three days after the murder, W1 failed to
identify X.
Give reasons for the effect each proposition and all propositions together have on
your judgment.
H
General propositions. In arguments about evidence, several different kinds of general
propositions play an important role both as discrete steps in an argument and as
background knowledge. At this stage it is useful to make elementary distinctions
between scientiﬁc truths (such as the law of gravity, that eyewitness identiﬁcation
evidence is often unreliable), common sense generalizations (such as that running
away is indicative of a sense of guilt), commonly held beliefs (such as national or
ethnic stereotypes, including prejudices, that suggest that a person of such origins
has certain characteristics), and general background information bearing on the
present case (case speciﬁc generalizations, such as a generalization about X’s habits
or Y’s character).
28 A recent report of empirical research on eyewitness evidence suggests that eyewitness
statements reporting identifying characteristics of a suspect made in circumstances
approximating those under which W1 observed a person entering Y’s home
(proposition 2) are only 100 percent correct in 5 percent of the cases.
29 A recent scientiﬁc report suggests that properly conducted laboratory matching of
traces of human hair in conditions approximating those upon which the conclusions
reﬂected in proposition 7 were based are correct in over 95 percent of cases.
30 X regularly had afternoon tea with Y on Sundays.
31 Few parents murder their children.
32 Features a, b, c, d were as follows: (a) white hair; (b) approximate height of ﬁve feet;
(c) a pronounced limp; (d) the wearing of a cheap brown coat.
State all the generalizations that you think may be helpful in interpreting the signif-
icance of these propositions. Classify each generalization.
I
Construct a list of ten propositions relevant to Pa. Can you think of a more efﬁcient
way of marshaling the data? If so, describe it.

Analysis of Evidence
J
You are the ofﬁcer who has just been appointed to be in charge of the investigation.
Review the information gathered so far:
a
Is there any missing evidence?
b
Is there an absence of important evidence about Y and how she met her death?
c
Is there any direct evidence of the identity of the murderer, if this was murder?
d
What direct or circumstantial evidence is there relating to X’s opportunity to kill Y?
e
Imagine three possible scenarios that might explain Y’s death. Use these to identify
good questions to ask at the next stage in this investigation.
f
Construct a plausible story incorporating all the data in propositions 1 to 30 that
indicates that it was almost certainly X who was the killer. Now construct an
alternative, rival, story that indicates that it was almost certainly W3, and not X, who
was the killer.
g
Can you eliminate any of the witnesses as suspects at this stage?
K
Other standpoints.
a
You are X’s attorney about to interview her for the ﬁrst time about this event. What
information do you hope to obtain from her? Why?
b
You are the prosecuting attorney. You have to decide whether to arrest and charge
anyone in connection with the murder on the basis of the information contained in
propositions 1 to 32. Is it sufﬁcient for this purpose? If not, how far short is it of being
sufﬁcient?

some issues of substance are hidden in some of the debates about words.
One widely-held view might be restated in simpliﬁed form as follows: “materiality”
concerns what has to be proved for the proponent to succeed (the facts in issue) and is
governed by substantive law; “relevance” denotes a direct or indirect probative relation
between an evidentiary fact and a factum probandum (”tends to support” or “tends

to negate”) and is a matter of logic; “probative force” denotes the strength of such
support or negation; it is based on “experience,” but there are few settled criteria for
evaluation; questions of “admissibility” concern the exclusion of otherwise relevant
evidence and are governed by the law of evidence (including the principles governing
judicial discretions to exclude). (Twining (1985) 153.)
This quotation purports to restate “one widely-held view” about the distinctions
between materiality, relevance, weight, and admissibility. What are the main points
at which this view might be challenged? To what extent do you accept this view?

Fact investigation and the nature
of evidence
“Have you ever given any attention to the Science of Evidence?” said Mr. Grodman.
“How do you mean?” asked the Home Secretary, rather puzzled, but with a melancholy
smile. “I should hardly speak of it as a science; I look at it as a question of common
sense.”
“Pardon me, sir. It is the most subtle and difﬁcult of all the sciences. It is indeed
rather the science of the sciences. What is the whole of inductive logic, as laid down
(say) by Bacon and Mill, but an attempt to appraise the value of evidence, the said
evidence being the trails left by the Creator, so to speak? The Creator has (I say it in all
reverence) drawn a myriad red herrings across the track. But the true scientist refuses
to be bafﬂed by superﬁcial appearances in detecting the secrets of Nature.”1
A. Introduction: connecting the dots
Everyone draws inferences from evidence. The dog barks, you infer that someone
is approaching the house; a loud horn sounds behind me, I infer that the driver
is impatient or angry; there is a peculiar smell in the playroom after last night’s
teenage party; cigarettes? Hash? Or just leftover pizza? There is a fresh scratch on
the front fender of my car with traces of red paint; Aunt Edna has just roared off
in her new red Ferrari. There are dark clouds overhead, footprints in the sand,
lipstick on the shirt, ﬁngerprints on the steering wheel of a stolen car. All tell tales.
Inferential reasoning is a basic human skill.
All disciplines, from archeology to zoology, from history to astronomy, from
statistics to decision theory, have largely shared problems of evidence and inference
(Twining and Hampsher-Monk, 2003). As Bentham said: “The ﬁeld of evidence
is no other than the ﬁeld of knowledge” (Bentham 1810:1). Practicing lawyers,
policemen, and judges as well as accountants, aeronautical engineers, auditors,
intelligence analysts, and anyone involved in diagnosing damaged or faulty motor

to be tested, the propositions to be proved, and formal rules regulate the manner
in which cases are prepared and the admissibility and use of evidence.
In recent years, the study of evidence has gained a high proﬁle. In popular ﬁction,
lawyer-novelists have sometimes outsold writers of traditional crime ﬁction. On
television, as well as in bookstores, forensic scientists have joined the ranks of
detectives through the works of Patricia Cornwell and programs, such as “Crime
SceneInvestigation” (CBS television, 2003– ). In recentyears,internationalcriminal
tribunals and truth and reconciliation commissions have proliferated, raising new
problemsaboutevidenceandstorytelling.EventsinEasternEurope,Rwanda,South
Africa, and Latin America have stimulated an enormous interest in “memory,”
especially among historians.2 DNA is in the headlines regularly. In England several
policeauthoritieshavebeenwonovertoFLINTS(ForensicLedIntelligenceSystem),
a computer-based tool for investigating multiple crimes, and making links between
crimes that were not previously thought to be connected.3 Evidence was a primary
focus of attention in news about Iraq: the weapons inspections, Colin Powell’s
presentation to the Security Council, the question of links with Al Qaeda, the search
for “weapons of mass destruction,” and the investigations of the Commission on
Terrorism into the tragic events of September 11, 2001 (“9/11”).
Perhaps the strongest stimulus came from the terrorist attacks on 9/11. In the
postmortem after the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the
Pentagon in Washington, D.C., it has been repeatedly alleged that the events could
have been predicted because the US intelligence services had received several bits of
informationbuttheyfailed“toconnectthedots”(orwhatSherlockHolmesreferred
to as “triﬂes”). They had enough information to have predicted the event, but lacked
the capacity to collate and analyze it. They did not have the capacity to “connect the
dots” or methods for identifying as signiﬁcant a few triﬂes from the masses of data
that ﬂowed into different agencies from a variety of sources. This diagnosis led to
a reorganization of the intelligence services, changes in their training, and billions
of dollars spent (or misspent) on efforts to develop computer programs aimed at
assisting the process of analyzing intelligence data. The problems were encapsulated
in the satirical cartoon shown in Figure 2.1.
An article in The New Yorker in February 20034 reported interviews with leading
ﬁgures in the CIA and the Pentagon who are concerned with improving intelligence
analysis in the aftermath of 9/11. They included Donald Rumsfeld, George Tenet,
and Robert Gates. The starting-point was a judgment that American intelligence
agencies did not possess the analytic depth or the right methods of analysis accu-
rately to assess possible threats. The diagnosis and the prescriptions were expressed
largely in terms that are familiar to students of evidence and inference: the dangers
of a commitment to a single hypothesis; the need to distinguish between generating
ahypothesisandtestingitagainsttheavailabledata;thedifferentproblemsthatarise

from a surfeit of information and absence of relevant and credible evidence; the
difference between ambiguity and incompleteness; the value of alternative interpre-
tations of ambiguous evidence; the dangers of “mirror imaging,” that is “projecting
of American values and beliefs onto America’s adversaries and rivals”; a tendency
to confuse the unfamiliar with the improbable; the relationship between a calculus
of risk and thresholds of credibility; the likelihood of political bias entering into
judgments where the situation is uncertain. These and other problems have been

sometimes different, all of these ideas should be familiar to students of evidence and
inference; some of them seem to be derived, directly or indirectly, from Wigmore
(1913, 1937) and Schum (1994).
The information that may have been available before 9/11 illustrates some of the
difﬁculties associated with the task of “connecting the dots.” Before the terrorists
used airplanes as ﬂying bombs to destroy the World Trade Center and damage the
Pentagon, the FBI had received information that several foreign nationals from the
Mideast, with little or no prior training or experience, had enrolled in different
civilian ﬂying schools to learn how to ﬂy large commercial aircraft. It was widely
reported that they wanted to learn how to steer and navigate civilian airliners, but

49
not how to make landings or takeoffs in these aircraft, and that they had all paid
cash for the lessons.5 Assuming that these were the facts that had been reported,
how might the FBI dots have been connected?
With the wisdom of hindsight, it was clear that the FBI dots, the training requests
made by the foreign nationals who sought ﬂying lessons, were signiﬁcant informa-
tion that was available before 9/11. Suppose that a well-trained analyst had focused
on these dots because of an intuition that they were suspicious. She might have
thought about this information by asking and answering the following questions:
1 Identifying the reasons for suspicion. This seems suspicious: Why? Answer: because:
a A trained pilot of any aircraft needs to know how to take off and land;
b Several foreign nationals all doing something unusual in the same time may be
acting in a coordinated way and belong to the same organization(s) or
group(s);
c A person who pays substantial sums of money using cash, rather than a credit card,
check, or bank transfer, may be trying to conceal his identity or the source of the
funds. Several people doing this simultaneously for the same type of transaction is
even more suspicious. The analyst might have identiﬁed additional reasons for
suspicion, but the reasons identiﬁed would have provided a sufﬁcient basis for the
next step.
2 Generating hypotheses. Why might someone want to be able to ﬂy and navigate a
commercial airliner, but not to land or take off?
a Innocent hypotheses.
i They plan to learn to land and take off later. This is Part I of an unusual
training scheme;
ii Flying an aircraft is simulated in many video games and these “students” wish
to design more realistic games;
iii An airline is training non-pilot staff to relieve pilots on long haul ﬂights.
b Sinister hypotheses.
iv The ﬂights these persons will be on board are for carrying drugs (or other
contraband). They do not want to disclose the aircraft’s destination to the pilot
until the plane is almost there;
v The “students” plan to hijack one or more civilian airliners and the hijackers
wish to control the ﬂying and navigation prior to landing, but will force the
pilot(s) to land at their chosen destination(s);
5 These reports are contested. Staff investigators of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks
Upon the United States reported that, “According to their ﬂight instructors [in San Diego] Hamzi
and Mihdhar [two al Qaeda terrorists] said they wanted to learn how to control an aircraft in ﬂight,
but took no interest in take-offs or landings.” Staff Statement No. 16, “Outine of 9/11 Plot” (2004)
at 14. In an earlier statement, they implied that the FBI did not have this information before 9/11.
“Contrary to popular belief, Zacarias Moussaoui [the alleged twentieth hijacker] did not say he
was not interested in learning how to take off and land. Instead, he stood out because, with little
knowledge of ﬂying, he wanted to learn how to take off and land a Boeing 747.” Staff Statement
No. 10, “Threats and Responses in 2001” (2004). See “Post 9/11 investigations: an exercise” below
at pp. 52–53 for a fuller account.

Analysis of Evidence
vi It is not intended that the planes should land because they will be blown up in
midair;
vii It is not intended that the airliners should land, because they will be used as
“ﬂying bombs” directed at speciﬁc targets on an analogy with suicide bombers.
The list needs to be kept open in case other possible hypotheses are suggested as the
inquiry develops, but the hypotheses identiﬁed are sufﬁcient to enable the analysts to
proceed.
3 Eliminating some hypotheses. Hypotheses i and ii are the least plausible, given the
number of “students,” the secrecy, and the departure from international regulations.
Moreover, hypotheses i, ii, and iii could easily be checked. Fairly simple inquiries to
determine the identity and background of the students and whether any foreign
or domestic airlines had adopted training programs such as those identiﬁed in
hypotheses i and iii should have enabled the analyst to determine whether they could
be eliminated at this stage. The identities of the students and their backgrounds should
have enabled the analyst to determine whether hypothesis ii could be eliminated.
4 Prioritizing the remaining hypotheses. On the basis of this information alone, the
analyst might have provisionally ranked hypotheses iv–vii in terms of seriousness,
plausibility, and easiness to check. For example, hypothesis vi is very serious, but it is
implausible because it is not necessary for hijackers to take control of a plane in order
to blow it up, unless it is planned to blow it up near a target (see hypothesis vii).
Hypothesis iv merits investigation, but in terms of the consequences, it is less serious
than the remainder.6 Moreover, that hypothesis ought to have been relatively easy to
pursue (and perhaps eliminate) through checks on the identity of the “students” and
their associates and through information available to the FBI and to customs and
drug enforcement agencies about the use of aircraft in transporting drugs (or other
contraband).
The size of the group, the seriousness of the danger, and the relative plausibility
of the scenario, given this information, should have suggested to the analyst that
hypothesis vii deserves the highest priority, but that hypothesis v also needed to
be pursued as a matter of urgency. Of course, the possibility of further hypotheses
must be kept open. In focusing on hypothesis vii, there would have been some fairly
obvious ﬁrst lines of inquiry: for example, to what group(s) or organizations(s) do
the students belong? Is there any information about the capabilities and intentions
of these group(s) or organization(s)? What might be the targets of such attacks?
What might be the timing? And so on. The evidence discovered in pursuing the ﬁrst
6 Prior to 9/11, the FBI probably would have focused its resources on hypothesis iv. Throughout
its history, the bureau has focused upon post-event investigations to develop criminal cases. The
incentive structure rewarded agents based upon statistics reﬂecting arrests, indictments, and prose-
cutions. Control over cases was in the ﬁeld ofﬁces, not FBI headquarters. These and other practices
had established a law enforcement culture that constricted the bureau’s ability to gather and share
informationandtousethatinformationforstrategicanalysisforterrorismprevention.SeeNational
Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Staff Statement No. 9, “Law Enforce-
ment, Counterterrorism, and Intelligence Collection in the United States Prior to 9/11.” That
culture was deeply ingrained and resistant to change. See also Staff Statement No. 12, “Reforming
Law Enforcement, Counterterrorism, and Intelligence Collection in the United States.”

COMBINATIONS OF DOTS OR TRIFLES:
A COMBINATORIAL EXPLOSION
Given N dots/trifles, there are 2N –{N+1} possible 
combinations of two or more of them.

Figure 2.2 Possible combinations of two or more dots/triﬂes
two lines of inquiry should have enabled the analyst to re-evaluate the plausibility
of hypothesis v. Meanwhile, preventive action might have been taken in respect of
these “students” before their courses ended.
This exampleshows that even a single potentially signiﬁcant piece of information
can be used to generate hypotheses, and to eliminate some, through a combination
of imaginative reasoning and background knowledge. Each potentially plausible
hypothesis can then be used to generate lines of inquiry, speciﬁc questions, and
to serve as a metaphoric “magnet” for generating other information, which may
or may not be already available. However, this report was quite unusual because a
piece of isolated information (more accurately a small number of related dots) was
sufﬁcient to arouse suspicion, focus attention, and be usable to generate hypotheses.
It is much more common that an analyst must sift through large numbers of dots,
each of which may seem trivial or insigniﬁcant on its own, seeking combinations
whose signiﬁcance is greater than the sum of the individual parts.
There are three basic problems inherent in the task of “connecting the dots.”
First, we must decide which dots to connect. The number of possible combinations
grows exponentially as the number of dots. Figure 2.2 illustrates the difﬁculties
encountered in examining combinations of dots. For example, if there were just ﬁfty
dots, there would be more than a million billion [1.13(10)15] possible combinations
of two or more dots. In most instances there will be many more than ﬁfty dots to
connect; in some cases, there may be thousands or even millions of dots to consider.
Clearly, it makes no sense to examine all of these possible combinations, even if
we had the fastest conceivable computer. This would be a strategy of examining
everything in the hope of ﬁnding something. What we need are strategies for better
using our imaginations in deciding which dots to combine. The questions posed in
the example above provide an example of such a strategy.

Analysis of Evidence
Second, combining dots or triﬂes involves more than just combining single items
of information or details. Other dots come in the form of thoughts the analyst has
about the meaning or signiﬁcance of these informational details. Connecting the
dots involves combining thoughts as well as potential items of evidence. Third,
the analyst must decide what the identiﬁable combinations of evidential dots and
her thoughts about them might mean. Connecting these dots makes it possible to
generate hypotheses, but this process is also involved in constructing defensible and
persuasive arguments about hypotheses in light of the available evidence.
Post 9/11 investigation: an exercise
According to statements prepared by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks
on the United States and other information published during post 9/11 investiga-
tions, agencies of the United States had the following information prior to 9/11.
1 The Federal Aviation Administration had information claiming that, in the 1990s,
associates of Usama Bin Ladin were interested in hijacking and using aircraft as a
weapon. Moreover, the FAA had considered the potential for terrorist suicide
hijackings in the United States not later than March 1998. There was, however, no
evidence indicating that the FAA possessed any credible and speciﬁc intelligence that
Usama Bin Ladin, Al Qaeda, or any other groups were actually plotting to hijack
commercial airplanes and use them as weapons of mass destruction. The FAA
discounted that threat in presentations that it made to air carriers in 2000 and 2001
because it had “no indication that any group is currently thinking in that direction.”
Staff Statement No. 3 at 4.
2 On July 10, 2001, the Phoenix ofﬁce of the FBI sent a report of a ﬁeld investigation
instituted in April 2000 whose purpose was “to advise the Bureau and the New York
ofﬁce [the ‘Ofﬁce of Origin’ for the FBI’s Al Qaeda program] of the possibility of a
coordinated effort by Usama Bin Ladin (UBL) to send students to the United States to
attend civil aviation universities and colleges.” The memorandum reported that an
“inordinate number of individuals of investigative interest” were or had attended civil
aviation universities and colleges in Arizona, including Zakaria Soubra, a “hardcore
Islamic extremist who views the U.S. as an enemy of Islam.” The Phoenix
memorandum made many recommendations, including a recommendation that
“FBIHQ should discuss this matter with other elements of the U.S. intelligence
community and task the community for any information that supports Phoenix’s
suspicions.”7
3 On August 15, 2001, the Minneapolis FBI ﬁeld ofﬁce initiated an investigation
concerning Zacarias Moussaoui. He had entered the country in February and had
taken ﬂying lessons at ﬂight school in Oklahoma. On August 13, he began ﬂight
7 A redacted copy of the Phoenix memorandum is reproduced in an appendix to the joint report of
the U.S. Senate and House Select Committees on Intelligence that conducted a joint inquiry into
intelligence activities before and after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (S. Rept. 107-351
and House Rept. No. 107-792).

training at the Pan American ﬂight training school in Minneapolis. He stood out
because, with little knowledge of ﬂying, he wanted to learn how to takeoff and land a
Boeing 747. On August 15, he was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service on the ground that he was a French national who had overstayed his visa
because the FBI agent who handled the case in conjunction with the INS
representative on the Minneapolis Joint Terrorism Task Force suspected that
Moussaoui wanted to hijack planes. The Minneapolis ofﬁce sent a summary of the
investigation to FBI headquarters on August 18, with a request to the legal attach´e in
Paris for assistance. The legal attach´e responded quickly. According to a letter sent by
Special Agent Rowley to FBI director Robert Mueller after the 9/11 attacks, the attach´e
advised that the French Intelligence had conﬁrmed Moussaoui’s afﬁliation with
radical fundamentalist Islamic groups and activities connected to Usama Bin Ladin.
(“The 9/11 Commission Report”) (2004) (the “9/11 Report”) at 273.
4 In September 1999, the Central Intelligence Agency received a report that it had
commissioned from the Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress titled,
“The Sociology and Psychology of Terrorism: Who Becomes a Terrorist and Why?”
(the “CIA Report”). In the executive summary, the authors concluded that
“Al-Qaeda’s expected retaliation for the U.S. Cruise missile attack against al-Qaeda
training facilities in Afghanistan on August 28, 1998, could take several forms of
terrorist attack in the nation’s capital . . . Suicide bomber(s) belonging to an al-Qaeda
Martyrdom Battalion could crash land an aircraft packed with high explosives (C-4
and semtex) into the Pentagon, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA), or the White House . . . ” CIA Report at 7. None of this information was treated
with urgency prior to 9/11.
Questions
1 Put yourself in the position of the hypothetical FBI analyst described above. It is
August, 2001. You have the information described in paragraphs 2 and 3 above.
Assuming the information excited your suspicions, how would you proceed? Would
your hypothesis have differed from those posed above? If so, how and why? What
further immediate investigative steps would you have recommended?
2 During the summer of 2001, the FAA, the FBI, and the CIA were aware that there was
a heightened risk that terrorists would undertake major attacks in the near future.
How would you have designed a system that might have brought all the dots noted
above into a single database? If you were an analyst with access to such a database,
what questions would you have asked that might have connected these dots?
3 Put yourself in the position of a CIA analyst in the summer of 2001. You recalled and
restudied the Library of Congress report and became concerned about the conclusion
that al Qaeda might use aircraft as suicide bombs. Using the four-step methodology
used by the hypothetical FBI agent, how would you have proceeded? What questions
would you have sent to the FBI and FAA and other intelligence agencies to generate
information to enable you to eliminate or support your priority hypothesis or
hypotheses?

Analysis of Evidence
4 Now assume that you had been a supervisory agent in the FBI. You were aware of the
generally heightened concern about terrorist threats and you had seen the Phoenix
memo and investigative summary sent by the Minneapolis ﬁeld ofﬁce. In your
capacity as supervising agent you received in late August 2001 the question you
submitted in your capacity as a CIA analyst. How would you have responded? What
additional actions by the FBI or other agencies would you have recommended?
Recognizing that the FBI had limited resources and a culture that tended to
“back-burner” investigative requests that were unrelated to the bureau’s crime-
solving culture, how would you have prioritized these requests? Had your superiors
declined to assign these requests the priority you thought they deserved, what if
anything do you now think that you would have done?
The examples based on 9/11 developed above illustrate three points that are
central to understanding evidence in general, as well as evidence in legal contexts.
i The ingredients of proof in law and in other contexts involve evidence, hypotheses,
propositions to be proved, possible explanations, and arguments linking evidence and
hypotheses. All of these ingredients must be generated as a result of imaginative
reasoning, also called abductive reasoning. Generation of these ingredients is a major
element of fact investigation. But the more familiar logical forms of reasoning,
deductive and inductive, are also required in the testing of hypotheses and in the
construction of arguments linking evidence and hypotheses. Computers can be of
help in locating and sorting data, but no program has been developed or is likely to be
developed to serve as a substitute for the imaginative reasoning possessed by human
beings.
ii Such reasoning activities cannot be productive in the absence of knowledge of the
major properties or “credentials” of evidence. These credentials – relevance,
credibility, and probative (inferential) force – have long been studied in the literature
on evidence in the ﬁeld of law. In fact, there is a rich legacy of knowledge about these
credentials that has accumulated in law and that could be taken to greater advantage
by persons in many other disciplines as well as by practicing lawyers. This legacy has
accumulated over the centuries largely as a result of repeated experiences in the
crucible of adversarial encounters in our Anglo-American adversarial system for
settling disputes.
iii Evidence varies substantively, or in terms of its content, in a nearly inﬁnite fashion
and comes from many different sources. There is a method, however, of classifying
forms of evidence that is substance-blind. This method allows us to study and analyze
evidence without regard to the content of the evidence.
All of these general aspects of the study of evidence are an essential part of
understanding evidence in legal and in other contexts. The next part deals with
fact investigation, preserving the metaphor of generating dots, triﬂes, or details
and ﬁnding potential explanations for those we generate during fact investigation.

Part C identiﬁes and explains the credentials of evidence. The last part explains the
importance of using the substance-blind form in examining evidence.8
B. Fact investigation: generating dots and explanations for them
One of the most important and difﬁcult tasks in the practice of law is fact inves-
tigation.9 Fact investigation involves the generation or discovery of the necessary
ingredients of the later process of proof during which the parties present their com-
petingviewsabout“thefacts”insomedispute.Theseingredientsincludehypotheses
or propositions to be proved, evidence, and arguments linking hypotheses and evi-
dence. Thus, fact investigation involves the analysis, as well as the gathering, of
evidence.
Fact investigation may also appropriately be termed fact inquiry because a crucial
ingredient of fact investigation is the asking of questions. Fact investigation, as an
ongoing process, is a dynamic activity; it takes place over time, and every episode
is unique. The investigator learns different things at different times in response to
questionssheasks.Asfactinvestigationproceeds,theinvestigatoroftenhashypothe-
ses in search of evidence and, at the same time, evidence in search of hypotheses.
Knowing what questions she should be asking at any given time is rarely obvious,
except in hindsight. Often, the most productive questions cannot be asked until she
obtains answers to many other questions that may not seem important at the time
they are asked.
In contrast, analysis is static. It is necessary at all stages of the process, but it is
episodic rather than continuous. The investigator analyzes the then available data
and hypotheses to reﬁne the hypotheses (or generate new ones) and to determine
whether and how the investigation should be directed or redirected. Given the
analysis done, what further questions need to be addressed?
1. Types of logical reasoning and justiﬁcation
Fact investigation in law shares many attributes that characterize discovery-related
activities in other contexts such as science, history, medicine, and intelligence anal-
ysis. In any context, investigation and analysis (and proof) require the use of the
three standard forms of logic: deductive, inductive, and abductive. Arguments in
8 A note on terminology: Lawyers are familiar with terms such as direct evidence, circumstantial
evidence, real evidence, discovery, and corroboration, which have acquired technical legal meanings
and have sometimes been the subject of controversy. These terms have different meanings when
they are used by logicians, probabilists, newspaper reporters, and others. As this book is about the
logic of proof, we have adopted deﬁnitions for a few terms (direct, circumstantial, corroboration)
that ﬁt this framework and which diverge from technical legal usage. For the sake of precision
we have also used a few terms that may be unfamiliar such as ancillary evidence, probandum, and
autoptic proference. All of these terms are deﬁned in the Glossary.
9 The term is taken from the title of a book on fact investigation by Binder and Bergman (1984).

Analysis of Evidence
each of these forms can be expressed in the form of a syllogism. In deductive logic,
the major premise must be a statement that is universally true:
Deductive:
All As are Bs
X is an A
X is [necessarily] a B.
In inductive logic, in the sense of practical reasoning, the major premise is not
universally true and ordinarily not stated. It is a generalization, a proposition, that
may be true “usually,” “many times,” “more often than not,” “sometimes,” etc. It can
however, be expressed in syllogistic form by articulating the generalization upon
which an inference depends.
Inductive:
Many As are Bs
X is an A
X is probably a B
Abductive reasoning is discussed in detail in the next section. It is the creative
process of reasoning. Rather than reasoning from a hypothesis to a conclusion
based upon the evidence, it involves reasoning from the evidence to a hypothesis
that might explain it.
Abductive:
Surprising event A has occurred
If H were true, A would follow
There is reason to believe that H might be true.
The applications of these forms of logic are described and illustrated in the
materials that follow. For now, it is important to recognize that in legal and most
other practical contexts a conclusion based upon the evidence can only be justiﬁed
as rational through the use of one or more of these forms of logic.
2. Abductive reasoning and the generation of a new idea
In any context, investigation or discovery involves imaginative or creative thought.
For many centuries it was assumed that the generation of hypotheses and new ideas
involved some species of inductive reasoning. It was not until the late 1800s that
questions arose regarding whether new ideas can arise by purely inductive means.
It is one thing to justify some hypothesis inductively, based on evidence. But it is
quite another thing to say how this hypothesis arose in the ﬁrst place.
This distinction was considered carefully by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914).
Peirce argued that new ideas could not be generated by deductive reasoning, which
shows that something is necessarily true. The price paid for necessity in such an
argument is the absence of new information, since a deductive conclusion contains
nothing that is not already included in its premises. Peirce also argued that new
ideas cannot arise strictly on the basis of inductive reasoning. Such reasoning shows
that some hypothesis is probably true, based on evidence. But this form of reasoning
is involved in the justiﬁcation of a known hypothesis and does not explain how the

hypothesis was generated or discovered in the ﬁrst place. Peirce argued that there
must be another form of reasoning associated with discovery and the generation
of hypotheses or possible explanations. He termed this third form of reasoning
abduction, by means of which we show that something is possibly or plausibly true.
Peirce associated abductive reasoning with ﬂashes of insight (Peirce (1903) 304):
The abductive suggestion comes to us like a ﬂash. It is an act of insight, although of
extremely fallible insight. It is true that the different elements of the hypothesis were in
ourmindsbefore;butitistheideaofputtingtogetherwhatwehadneverbeforedreamed
of putting together which ﬂashes the new suggestion before our contemplation.
Peirce went on to put abductive reasoning in the following syllogistic form:
The surprising fact E1 is observed;
But if hypothesis H were true, E1 would be a matter of course,
Thus, there is reason to suspect that H might be true.
Theabductiveprocessisgraphicallyillustratedinthemodiﬁedarchofknowledge
shown in Figure 2.3.10 Peirce’s abductive syllogism deﬁnes the upward arm. The
downward arm can be similarly expressed in syllogistic form.
If H were true, then one or more of facts E2, E3, and E4 ought to exist.
Assume H is true.
Thus, there is reason to believe that one or more of facts E2, E3, and E4 exist.
10 Philosopher David Oldroyd (1986) developed the original arch of knowledge. As here, he used
it as a metaphor to describe the process of investigation and discovery. We have modiﬁed it to
make clear how the arch can be used to describe the reasoning involved in fact investigation and
discovery in legal contexts.

Analysis of Evidence
The value of a new hypothesis to an investigator rests not only on its ability
to explain evidence she already has; it may also allow her to generate new lines of
inquiry that have not been suggested by other hypotheses she had been entertaining.
The abductive process is not static. As a result of exploring the lines of inquiry
suggested by H1 or through other inquiries the investigator may discover new facts
that require that H1 be revised or eliminated. For example, the items of evidence,
E2, E3, and E4, that ought to have existed if H1 were true may not exist (or may
not be found). In other words, H1 has failed this test. Instead, her inquiries may
lead to the discovery of new items of evidence that makes it necessary to revise
H1. So too, new lines of inquiry suggested by H1 may result in observations that
suggest a new hypothesis, H2, different from H1. What we have to imagine are
sequences of arches laid side by side as we generate more possible explanations or
hypotheses.
A second difﬁculty with Figure 2.3 involves the nature of the linkage between the
initial observation and the hypothesis that the investigator generated to explain this
observation. If the analyst is asked to show how some new hypothesis H1 explains
E1, the phenomenon that allowed her to generate it, she encounters the necessity for
constructing an often elaborate argument or chain of reasoning from her observa-
tion to this new hypothesis H.11 For that reason, fact investigation activities always
involve mixtures of abductive, inductive, and deductive reasoning.
There is a direct connection between the theoretical matters we have just been
discussing and the practice of fact investigation in law. It happens that, at the same
time Peirce was developing his thoughts about abductive reasoning, across the
Atlantic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was developing the character of Sherlock Holmes.
There is no evidence that Peirce and Conan Doyle each knew of the other’s work.
Though Holmes describes his reasoning feats as “deductions,” it is clear that the
form of his reasoning was abductive in nature.12
3. Generating explanations for dots or triﬂes
The importance of considering dots or triﬂes has never been better illustrated than
in the exploits of Sherlock Holmes. In the Boscombe Valley Mystery, Holmes tells his
colleague Dr. Watson (Baring-Gould, 1967, Vol. II, 148), “It was by an examination
of the ground that I gained the triﬂing details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade,
as to the personality of the criminal.”
Watson says: “But how did you gain them?”
11 TheconstructionofcomplexargumentsbasedonevidenceisdiscussedanddevelopedinChapters3
and 4.
12 A valuable account of the connections between Peirce’s abductive reasoning and Holmes’s inves-
tigative methods is the work of Umberto Eco and Thomas Sebeok (1983). Dr. Bell’s observations
about a new patient, Holmes’s determination that Watson had returned from Afghanistan, and
Kemelman’s “Nine mile walk” in Chapter 1 provide additional examples of Peirce’s abductive
reasoning and illustrate the mixture of reasoning forms that are commonly required.

Figure 2.4 Generating hypotheses from dots or triﬂes
Holmes replies: “You know my method. It is founded on the observance of
triﬂes.”
The “triﬂes” Holmes mentioned refer to any single dot or detail obtained during
fact investigation, whether it comes from a witness or from tangible evidence of
some sort.
In fact investigation, the number of triﬂes mounts up quickly as the process
unfolds. In either a criminal or civil case each question posed may lead the investi-
gator to a signiﬁcant number of triﬂes. Difﬁculties arise, as we illustrate in Figure 2.4
above, when she begins the process of trying to make sense out of a rapidly accu-
mulating collection of triﬂes. In this ﬁgure, each dot represents a triﬂe she has
collected.
As Figure 2.4 illustrates, on some occasions you might be fortunate in observing
a single triﬂe that may suggest a new hypothesis – for example, in a criminal inves-
tigation ﬁngerprints, DNA samples, shoe prints or other traces that can point to
a particular suspect (hypothesis). In most cases, however, the generation of a new
hypothesis or possibility is based upon a combination of several or many triﬂes. This
is where the difﬁculties arise. The number of triﬂe combinations increases exponen-
tially as the number of triﬂes gathered increases. The investigator as analyst must
determine which triﬂe combinations to examine. Prescribed methods for analyzing
the triﬂes and for marshaling the investigator’s or analyst’s thoughts become impor-
tant at this stage. The principles of logic and the ways they are applied in analyzing
evidence in a legal context are presented and illustrated in Chapter 3. Methods of

Analysis of Evidence
analysis that enable the analyst, be she an investigator or a lawyer preparing for trial,
are presented in Chapters 4, 5, and 6.13
C. On the credentials of evidence
There are three major characteristics or credentials of an evidential datum that must
beestablishedinanalyzingitsrelationshiptoahypothesis:Relevance,credibility,and
probative [inferential] force or weight. No triﬂe comes with these credentials already
established; these credentials rest upon arguments constructed by the analysts. For
that reason, we must ﬁrst consider the major ingredients of arguments.
1. Evidential foundations of argument
Arguments consist of evidence, hypotheses, and statements called generalizations
thatjustifylinkages between evidence and hypotheses.Metaphorically,anargument
isachainofreasoningfromevidencetohypotheses.Linksinthesechainscorrespond
to stages or steps in an argument. Each link exposes a source of possible doubt or
uncertainty.
In arguments based on evidence, there is a necessary distinction to be made
between evidence of some event and the event itself. In symbols, E∗represents
evidence (of some kind) about event E. Just because this evidence E∗says that event
E occurred does not entail that E did occur. In fact, from E∗the decision-maker can
only infer to some degree that event E did occur. For example, a witness Mary asserts
E∗, that she saw Harold let the air out of his boss’s tires last Monday. Just because
Mary makes this assertion does not mean that Harold did let the air out of his
boss’s tires (event E). Mary’s credibility is open to question. The same idea applies
to other forms of evidence. For example, Evidence E∗
2 in the form of a photograph
allegedly shows event E2, that Frank was in front of the bank shortly before it was
robbed on March 4, at 3 p.m. The decision-maker must be concerned about the
authenticity of this photo. This photo may have been doctored in various ways; it
may also have been taken on a different day at a different time. Issues of credibility
raise very important sources of doubt, but there are other doubts that arise when
we attempt to relate evidence to hypotheses or matters we are trying to prove.
In law a hypothesis is a proposition to be proved (a probandum). Probanda occur
at several different levels in an argument. A probandum is always a proposition that
in principle can be shown to be true or false. Levels of probanda in an argument
are illustrated in Figure 2.5.
In a legal case there will be a major or basic probandum at issue which we refer
to as the ultimate probandum. The rule of law that will be applied to determine
whether the plaintiff or the prosecutor is entitled to relief may be viewed as the
major premise. The ultimate probandum is the minor premise. If the evidence
13 Recent research suggests that how skillful we are at marshaling our existing thoughts and evidence
inﬂuences how skillful we will be in generating new hypotheses and new lines of inquiry and
evidence (Tillers and Schum (1991); Schum (1999)).

Figure 2.5 Levels of probanda in an argument
establishes that the ultimate probandum is true to the required degree of certainty,
then the verdict must be for the prosecution or the plaintiff. In criminal cases, for
example, an ultimate probandum includes all conditions that the prosecution must
prove to be true beyond reasonable doubt, in order to justify a conviction. So, in a
murder case, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt: that the victim
is dead; that it was an unlawful act that caused the victim’s death; that it was the
accused who committed that act; and that the accused had the intent required by
the law of the jurisdiction in which the murder occurred. In civil cases the ultimate
probandum consists of the ultimate facts the plaintiff must plead and prove in order
to prevail.
An ultimate probandum is either (rarely) a simple proposition or (usually) a
compound proposition that can be broken down into simple propositions, each of
which needs to be proved in order to prove the ultimate probandum. These simple
propositions are termed penultimate probanda. These penultimate probanda are
the material facts. The ﬁeld of law is unique in that the law deﬁnes the material facts
or the speciﬁc propositions or elements that are necessary and sufﬁcient to prove
some ultimate probandum.
The evidence E∗in Figure 2.5 is linked to penultimate probandum P1 by a chain
of reasoning indicated by propositions E, F, and G. Each of these propositions may
be true or false and thus represent a source of doubt interposed between evidence E∗
andpenultimateprobandumP1.Thesepropositionswerefertoasinterimprobanda.
All probanda, ultimate, penultimate, and interim, are potential sources of doubt or

uncertainty. This is what the term probandum indicates; they are all matters to be
proved.

P1.Thesegeneralizations,alsocalledwarrants (Toulmin,1964),supplyjustiﬁcations
for each reasoning link. Generalizations are commonly “if then” statements that
are inductive in nature; that is, they are hedged probabilistically in some way. For
example, consider generalization G2 in Figure 2.5 that licenses the inference of
proposition F from proposition E. This generalization might read: “If an event like
E occurs, then (usually, frequently, often) an event like F will occur.” For example,
assume that a police ofﬁcer testiﬁes in a narcotics case E∗that he observed person
X passing a small packet of white powder to person Y at this time and place. From
this evidence, the fact ﬁnder is asked to infer that X did pass a small packet of
white powder to person Y at this time and place. The applicable generalization on
which the inference is based might be stated as, “If a police ofﬁcer testifying under
oath says that an event occurred, then this event almost certainly/probably/possibly
did occur.” Some generalizations may be based on what is referred to as “common
sense generalizations” while others are based on speciﬁc knowledge of phenomena
that the events describe. The kinds of generalizations, as well as various inferential
hazards they present, are described in Chapters 3, 4, and 10. These basic argument
ingredients make it possible to provide an introductory account of the three basic
credentials of evidence.
2. On relevance
When is a triﬂe evidence? The answer is: when its relevance to some material propo-
sition or matter to be proved in the case at hand is demonstrated. The Federal Rules
of Evidence in the United States provide a useful deﬁnition:
Rule 401. Deﬁnition of “Relevant Evidence.” “Relevant evidence” means evidence having
any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the deter-
mination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the
evidence.
In order to be relevant, evidence must either make a penultimate probandum
more or less probable (or must be relevant to the credibility of a witness or other
evidenceofferedinthecase).Inshort,penultimateprobandasupplythetouchstones
for establishing the relevance of evidence.
There are two important species of relevant evidence – directly relevant evidence
and indirectly relevant evidence.14 These are illustrated in Figure 2.6. Evidence E∗is
14 The meaning of directly relevant and indirectly relevant should not be confused with the legal
meaning of the direct and indirect evidence. The terms direct and indirect evidence have different
meanings in law. In law, “[d]irect evidence is evidence which, if believed, resolves a matter in
issue.” McCormick (1999) 278. All other evidence is indirect or circumstantial because “even if the
circumstances depicted are accepted as true, additional reasoning is required to reach the desired
conclusion.” Id. (See further below pp. 76–77.)

directly relevant because it is linked directly by a chain of reasoning to a penultimate

reasoning is defensible.
The other four items of evidence A∗

2, A∗
3, and A∗
4 are also relevant, but
only indirectly so. Although they are themselves not directly linked to a penulti-
mate probandum, they are nevertheless relevant because they each bear upon the
strength or weakness of links in the chain of reasoning set up by an item of directly
relevant evidence. As a result, these four items are indirectly relevant or ancillary
evidence.
For example, a witness Willard testiﬁes that defendant Donald was at the scene
of the crime when it happened. His evidence is admitted since it bears upon Don-
ald’s opportunity to have committed the crime; i.e. it is directly relevant evidence.
Then a rebuttal witness Ruth testiﬁes that she was with Willard at a location several
miles away from the scene of the crime at the time the crime was committed. If
what Ruth says is true, then Willard’s assertion cannot be true. Ruth’s testimony
about Willard’s location is relevant because it makes it less probable that Donald
had an opportunity to commit the crime. However, Ruth’s testimony, when con-
sidered in light of Willard’s testimony, is also relevant because it diminishes or
negates the credibility of Willard’s testimony about Donald. In other words, Ruth’s
testimony is indirectly relevant and is ancillary evidence bearing upon Willard’s
credibility.
3. The credibility of evidence and its sources
An item of evidence can be either a tangible item or a testimonial assertion. A major
question is: To what extent can we believe what this evidence says? In other words,
and in symbols, if E∗represents the evidence we have that event E occurred, the
credibility question is: To what extent does E∗justify a belief or inference that event

Analysis of Evidence
E did actually occur? Unless evidence E∗is perfectly credible, it would be a mistake
to equate E∗and E. Having evidence that E occurred does not entail that E did in
fact occur.
There are two forms of evidence that may be relevant in a legal dispute –
tangible evidence and testimonial evidence. The attributes that must be consid-
ered in assessing the credibility of each form differ.15 Credibility involves more than
one dimension or attribute regardless of what kind of evidence we are considering,
but the speciﬁc attributes of credibility depend upon what kind of evidence we are
considering. Attributes of the credibility of testimonial evidence are quite different
from the attributes of the credibility of tangible evidence.
a. Tangible evidence
There are many forms of tangible evidence including objects, documents, sensor
images, measurements, and a variety of representations such as charts, maps, and
diagrams. All of these kinds of tangible evidence are open to inspection. What they
actually reveal in a particular situation is not always obvious.16 The trouble is that
tangible evidence is not always what it seems to be. Documents can be forged,
currency counterfeited, images labeled incorrectly, samples of blood mixed up,
and drugs planted on persons. There are three important attributes that must be
considered in assessing the credibility of tangible evidence.
i. Authenticity. Authenticity is the most important element of the credibility of
tangible evidence. In law, the party seeking to introduce a document, photograph,
or another item of tangible evidence must offer evidence “sufﬁcient to support
a ﬁnding that it is what it purports to be” (Federal Rule of Evidence 901). To
be admissible it must purport to be something that is relevant to a penultimate
probandum or to the credibility of other evidence in the case.
There are three major sources of ancillary evidence that may call into question
the authenticity of tangible evidence. The ﬁrst involves evidence that has been delib-
erately contrived in order to mislead others such as a forged document. Errors in
recording, transmitting, or processing evidence is the second source. Tangible evi-
dence may pass through many hands before it is offered at trial. The opportunities
for processing or handling errors of various kinds increases with the number of
hands a tangible item passes through. Blood samples may be mislabeled or even
15 In many contexts including law, the word “reliability” is often used synonymously for the term
“credibility.” The difﬁculty is that the term “reliability” has a much more restricted meaning than
does the term “credibility.” A process of some sort is reliable to the extent that it is consistent,
repeatable, or dependable. Thus, you believe your car is reliable to the extent that it will continue
to take you where you want to go for some speciﬁed time in the future.
16 In many cases, the decision-maker must rely upon the opinions of experts to tell her what event(s)
a tangible item reveals. For example, a ballistics expert may express an opinion identifying the
weapon from which a bullet was ﬁred and explain how the markings on the bullet enabled him
to form that opinion. Experts can be wrong in their interpretation of what event(s) a tangible
item reveals. It is the bullet that is tangible evidence; the expert’s opinion comes in the form
of testimonial assertions whose credibility can only be assessed by reference to the credibility
attributes of testimonial evidence. See below at pp. 65–67.

substituted one for another. That is the reason for the requirement that there should
be evidence establishing the chain of custody from the time the evidence was dis-
covered (the bloody glove) or generated (an entry into a business record) until the
time the evidence is presented at trial. If we do not know all of the links in a chain of
custody, we cannot vouch for the authenticity of a tangible item. Finally, the witness
whose testimony is offered to establish the authenticity of an item may be mistaken
or untruthful.
ii. Accuracy/Sensitivity. Sensing devices of all sorts can supply tangible evidence
in the form of images such as photographs and other sensor records. The credibility
issue here concerns whether a sensing device provides the degree of resolution
necessary for us to discriminate among possible events that may be recorded on
the image. In some instances the accuracy of a sensing device can be degraded by
inappropriatesettingsofthedevice’scontrols.Forexample,ifacameraisnotfocused
properly,thentheimageobtainedmaybeblurred.Insuchcaseswemaynotbeableto
tell whether the photo does in fact show person X, as the proponent of this evidence
claims. Courts admit business records as an exception to the hearsay rule only if
the witness who identiﬁes them knows enough about the process for recording the
data on which they were based, the process by which they were generated, and how
they were stored to enable the other party, through cross-examination, to identify
ﬂaws that might undermine the accuracy of the information they contain. This
issue of accuracy also applies to demonstrative evidence, such as statistical analyses,
results of which can be displayed in graphic or pictorial form. Every student of
elementary statistics learns how easy it is to construct inaccurate and misleading
graphic accounts of the results of statistical analysis.
iii. Reliability. A reliable process is one that is repeatable, dependable or consis-
tent. For some kinds of tangible evidence, reliability refers to the operating charac-
teristics of the device used to generate it. Such a device is reliable only if it gives the
same reading or image on repeated applications of the device. No sensing device
can provide reliable readings if the device is not properly maintained. For example,
a police radar gun cannot be expected to provide reliable indications of a car’s speed
if it has not been serviced regularly or if it has been dropped on several occasions.
Replicable or repeatable processes form the basis for all statistical analyses. The term
“reliability” in statistical analysis refers to the extent of measurement error that is
naturally associated with any statistical estimate.
b. The credibility of testimonial evidence
i. The basis for a testimonial assertion. An investigator or a lawyer must consider how
the witness acquired the data upon which her testimonial assertion is based. The
witness may have acquired the data from one or a combination of three sources. For
example, person P tells us that event E occurred, and we ask the natural question:
How do you know that E happened? P can give one of three possible answers. First,
she may say, “I observed the occurrence of E for myself.” P is claiming personal
knowledge of the occurrence of event E.

Analysis of Evidence
Second, she may say: “I did not observe event E myself, but I learned about
its occurrence from person Q.” In other words, P obtained information about the
occurrence of event E at second hand from another person Q. In fact, however, the
information obtained by P might have come through sources in addition to person
Q. For example, we might ask Q how she obtained information about event E,
and she might respond: “I heard about it from person R.” If we cannot question
R or otherwise discover the primary source of information about event E, then P’s
testimony has no better status than rumor or gossip. P’s testimony in this case is
hearsay. Whether or not such evidence would be admitted at trial depends on the
rules regulating the admissibility and use of hearsay evidence. But hearsay evidence
is often valuable evidence in advancing fact investigation, even when such evidence
might not be admissible later at trial.
Third, P might say: “I did not observe E myself. However, I observed two other
events C and D from which I inferred that event E also occurred.” This is opinion
evidence, not based on any personal knowledge of event E. The legal requirement
that a witness have personal knowledge of events upon which her testimony is based
addresses the primary difﬁculty such opinion evidence poses. The witness ought to
tell the decision-maker that she observed C and D so that the decision-maker can
decide whether those observations justify an inference that E occurred.17
ii. The credibility attributes of a testimonial assertion. Assessing the credibility
of any testimonial assertion requires consideration of three attributes: veracity,
objectivity, and observational sensitivity.
The term “veracity” has caused many difﬁculties in studies of witness credibility.
Suppose witness W tells us that event E occurred and we later discover that it did
not occur. This must mean that we now have conclusive evidence that event E did
not occur. Question: Was W lying to us in his testimony? The correct answer to
this question is: “Not necessarily.” Witness W might simply have been mistaken in
his observation, or was not objective in forming his beliefs. So, a person is being
untruthful in testimony only if this person testiﬁes against his/her beliefs. We must
be sure that challenges to a witness’s credibility are based on the correct forms of
ancillary evidence. For example, evidence that a witness has poor eyesight is not a
challenge to the witness’s veracity.
Now consider the objectivity attribute. Suppose we believe that witness W is
testifying in accordance with her beliefs. She testiﬁes E∗, that event E occurred,
and she ﬁrmly believes that event E did occur. Now the question is: On what basis
did she form this belief? Did she form this belief based on accurate and objective
17 In some circumstances, a witness may be permitted to express an opinion, lay or expert, because
that is the best or only way the decision-maker can understand the evidence. A lay person might
testify, “Harold was sad when the boss ﬁred him,” without providing a detailed description of
facial expression and behavior that led her to conclude he was sad. A qualiﬁed expert might testify,
“Based upon a comparison of the DNA in the blood found at the scene and the accused’s DNA, it
is almost certain that the blood at the scene was the accused’s blood,” because a non-expert would
be unable to understand or interpret the data upon which the expert’s opinion was based.

understanding of her sensory evidence, or did she form it on the basis of what she
either expected or wanted to occur? An illustration: We are all, on occasion, liable
to believe what we either expect or hope will occur regardless of what our senses tell
us. By deﬁnition, an objective observer is one who forms a belief based on evidence
rather than on surmise [expectations] or on desires.
Suppose we now believe that witness W’s belief about event E was formed objec-
tively on the basis of sensory evidence. The next question is: How good was this
sensory evidence? So, we now come to the credibility attribute we have labeled
“observational sensitivity.” There is much more to this attribute than just consider-
ing the adequacy of a witness’s sensory systems: vision, hearing, touch, smell, and
taste. Of course it is true that a person may be mistaken in testimony if his visual
acuity was poor, and uncorrected, at the time of an observation. But a witness hav-
ing very acute sensory powers under normal circumstances may still obtain faulty
sensory evidence.
Much depends on a witness’s general physical condition at the time of an obser-
vation. If the person was intoxicated, or under the inﬂuence of some narcotic or
other chemical substance, we cannot expect this person to make full use of her
sensory capabilities. Another general consideration concerns the conditions under
which an observation was made. A person having even very acute visual capabilities
would not be able to exploit these capabilities under very low levels of illumination.
Nor would a person with very acute hearing be able to recognize the content of
speech uttered in the presence of strong background noise.
c. Ancillary evidence about testimonial credibility attributes
What is so often overlooked is that the three credibility attributes of ordinary wit-
nesses just discussed are both time and context dependent. For example, witness
W might well have been more objective in observations regarding event A than he
would have been in observations about event B. Our sensory systems are known
to vary in their sensitivity over time. Fortunately, or unfortunately, no one keeps
statistical records regarding our veracity, objectivity, and observational sensitivity
that might subsequently be used if we show up as witnesses in a legal dispute. To
substitute for a lack of any statistical evidence regarding these attributes we sub-
stitute a variety of different items of evidence we may have about a person that
may serve as ancillary evidence regarding attributes of the credibility of ordinary
witnesses.
There is no discipline outside of law in which a more extensive effort has been
made to record various grounds for impeaching or supporting witness credibility.
Figure 2.7 identiﬁes grounds for impeaching and supporting witness credibility
that have been compiled over the ages. Each item listed is a form of ancillary
evidence bearing upon the credibility of ordinary witnesses, but only some, not
all, of these forms of ancillary evidence can be uniquely associated with one of the
three credibility attributes we have just discussed.

Analysis of Evidence
Figure 2.7 Ancillary evidence concerning attributes of witness credibility
FirstconsiderthecolumninFigure2.7labeled“Speciﬁc.”Hereareformsofancil-
lary evidence that can be associated speciﬁcally with one of the credibility attributes:
veracity, objectivity, and observational sensitivity. We have already discussed some
of these forms of evidence, but not all of them. In the case of observational sensitiv-
ity we must be concerned about the quality and duration of a witness’s observation.
Did the witness get just a brief look or did he have an opportunity to note details
during an observation? Did the witness have any personal characteristics, e.g., poor
eyesight, that might have affected her ability to make the observation accurately?
Did the witness have any area of expertise that would have allowed her to notice
certain important details that would not have been noticed by witnesses lacking
that expertise? Was the witness able to allocate full attention to what was being
observed, or was she distracted in some way during the observation? Sensory bias
refers to various ways in which our vision, hearing, and other senses might have
been biased, perhaps by clever forms of deception.
Three speciﬁc forms of ancillary evidence are listed under the objectivity
attribute. We have already mentioned how one’s expectancies may inﬂuence beliefs
as well as the various memory-related factors we discussed. Memory also affects the
objectivity of a witness’s testimony. Is there any evidence bearing upon the witness’s

69
ability to accurately recall the observations about which she was called to testify?
Objectivity bias refers to instances in which a witness may have been biased towards
believing an event occurred, or did not occur, regardless of the sensory evidence
she obtained.
Speciﬁc veracity-related evidence can involve several matters. Various forms of
prior behavior related to dishonesty are admissible under certain circumstances
as is any evidence of inﬂuence or corruption among two or more witnesses. The
demeanor and bearing of a witness while giving testimony may be relevant to her
credibility. However, not every composed witness is necessarily being truthful and
not every agitated or distraught witness is being untruthful.
Finally,thereisathirdcategoryofbiaswehavelabeledtestimonialbias.Regardless
of what a witness may believe about the occurrence of event E, this person may have
a distinct preference for revealing or not revealing what she believes. Some persons
may relish being the bearer of what they believe will be good news to one party or
the other. Other persons may have a distinct aversion to being the bearer of what
they regard as bad news for one of the parties in contention.
The second column in Figure 2.7, labeled “Less Speciﬁc,” contains classes of
ancillary evidence that may bear upon two of the credibility attributes. For example,
instructional sets of the sort mentioned earlier and an observer’s objectives may
bear upon both observational sensitivity and objectivity. Central processes in the
brain exert control over our senses. Indeed, the retinas of our eyes are extensions
of our brains. Thus the objectives for which an observation is made can inﬂuence
visual sensitivity, perhaps by increasing sensitivity. But objectives being entertained
at the time of observation may also inﬂuence the objectivity with which we form
beliefs based on the sensory evidence we obtain. We may be more “primed” to
believe one thing rather than another. In addition, any stakes, motives, or interests
in observations and testimony can inﬂuence both the objectivity with which we
form beliefs and our veracity in our testimony about these beliefs.
An important form of credibility-related ancillary evidence concerns self-
contradictions, i.e. prior inconsistent statements. A witness may tell a police ofﬁcer
immediately after some incident that event E occurred, but then later tell someone
else that event E did not occur. We cannot be sure in such instances whether these
self-contradictions involve this witness’s objectivity and memory, or whether they
indicate untruthfulness. In some instances, events interposed since an observation
may cause a person to revise a belief held earlier. The witness may simply be hon-
estly reporting a revised belief. Unfortunately, witnesses are known to “change their
stories” for other reasons involving their veracity – e.g., because they were bribed.
Finally, the two classes of ancillary evidence with question marks are simply pos-
sible forms of credibility-related ancillary evidence that would most likely not be
admissible at trial. However, they may be employed during fact investigation.
The column labeled “Unspeciﬁc” identiﬁes two of the oldest known forms of
evidence challenging credibility: contradictory and conﬂicting evidence from other
witnesses. Contradictory testimony involves events that cannot happen together;

Analysis of Evidence
i.e. they are mutually exclusive. Alibi evidence supplies an example. Joe testiﬁes that
defendant Mike was at the scene of the crime in Boston at the time the crime was
committed. Later, witness Mary testiﬁes that Mike was with her at this same time
in New York City. Mike cannot have been in both places at the same time.
Conﬂicting or divergent testimony involves testimony about different events that
may both have occurred but which favor different possibilities. As an example, we
may have evidence that Mike had the intention to commit the crime. But we may
also have evidence that Mike did not have the means to commit this crime. Here
are some reasons why contradictory and conﬂicting evidence are unspeciﬁc as far
as credibility is concerned. Suppose Mary testiﬁes that event E occurred at a certain
time. The opposition offers Paul who testiﬁes that event E did not occur at this
same time; here is a contradiction since E cannot have occurred and not occurred
at the same time. The opposition asserts that Paul has shown that Mary was being

fact that the credibility of both Mary and Paul is at issue. Second, suppose that Paul
is indeed correct about the nonoccurrence of event E. This hardly means that Mary
was being untruthful; she may have simply made an observational error or was not
objective in forming her beliefs based on the observation she made. The same kinds
of troubles occur when witnesses provide conﬂicting testimonies. Finally, some
forms of self-inconsistency can be linked to any of the three credibility attributes.
Onemajorpurposeofkeepingcarefultrackoftheassortedgroundsforcredibility
impeachment and support shown in Figure 2.7 is that we may hear arguments about
witness credibility that are grounded upon the wrong form of ancillary evidence.
Here are just two examples of such difﬁculties.
1 An opponent offers evidence that impeaches the objectivity of witness Mary by
showing that Mary strongly expected to observe event E. But then this opponent says:
“We have shown that Mary was not truthful in her testimony.” This conclusion does
not follow from the evidence given about Mary because she may have truthfully
reported what she believed at the time of her observation and what she believed at the
time she gave testimony. What is being challenged is Mary’s objectivity as an observer
and not her veracity in giving testimony.
2 The proponent offers a witness Joe who testiﬁes that event E occurred. The opponent
then offers another witness Walter who asserts that Joe was intoxicated at the time of
his observation. But then the opponent says: “My evidence from Walter shows that Joe
was not truthful in his testimony.” There are several troubles here, the most obvious
of which is that Joe’s alleged intoxication at the time of his observation, if true,
inﬂuences his observational sensitivity at the time of the event and not his veracity at
the time of testimony. Second, the opponent can hardly claim access to truth here
since the credibility of Walter is also at issue.

law.Synonymsfortheword“competence”include:qualiﬁed,adequate,appropriate,

or suitable. In some contexts other than law no distinction is made between the
competence and the credibility of a source of testimonial evidence. There are some
situationsinwhichthesetermsareusedsynonymously.Thisinvitesinferentialcatas-
trophe since not all competent persons are credible and not all credible persons are
competent. Competence and credibility appear to be independent characteristics.
You regard your Uncle Harold as the most honest, objective, and observationally
acute person you have ever known. But you would not solicit an opinion from Uncle
Haroldaboutagastrointestinalproblemyoucurrentlyfaceifhewasatruckdriveror
someone else not having the requisite competence to answer your question. On the
other hand, here is Mr. Smith who is regarded as an extremely competent auditor;
his opinions are often solicited by well-known industrial organizations. The trouble
is that Mr. Smith was privy to an episode of “cooking the books” in an organization,
which he later, untruthfully, denies.
In legal terms, an ordinary witness is competent if he or she was in a position to
make an observation, could understand what was being observed, and could coher-
ently recount the results of this observation. However, the credibility of a witness
concerns the extent to which her assertions can be believed. Believability depends
upon attributes concerning veracity, objectivity, and observational sensitivity.
4. On the probative force of evidence
The probative force of an item or body of evidence answers the question: “How
strong is this evidence in favoring or disfavoring some penultimate probandum
in the case at hand?” This ﬁnal major credential of evidence is in many ways the
most controversial. Though it is universally recognized that the probative force of
evidence is commonly graded in probabilistic terms, there is considerable disagree-
ment among legal scholars and probabilists about how such grading should take
place.
Any item of directly relevant evidence must be linked to a penultimate proban-
dum by a chain of inferences. This chain can contain several links. The ﬁrst link in
the chain is always the credibility link. The remaining links are those necessary to
demonstrate the relevance of the item to a penultimate probandum. The probative
force of an item depends upon the strength of each link in the chain. When there is
a mass of evidence to consider, there will be many chains of reasoning to consider.
Assessing the probative force of a mass of evidence requires that the probative force
of every chain be assessed and that the individual assessments be combined to deter-
mine the net probative value of the mass with respect to the ultimate probandum.
There are alternative ways in which the probative force of an item of evidence or of
a mass of evidence can be assessed. These are discussed in Chapters 8 and 9.
D. A substance-blind approach to evidence
Asked to say how many different kinds of evidence there are, we might be tempted to
throw up our hands and say: “The question is foolish; of course there are unlimited

Analysis of Evidence
varieties of evidence.” This would certainly be true if we were considering the
substance or content of evidence. By the substance or content of evidence we refer to
the kind of events the evidence supports. For example, an X-ray image, a spent shell
casing, a patient’s report of pain at a certain location, a passage from a contract,
and a reading from an oscilloscope all suggest the occurrence of different kinds of
events.
In fact investigation, the investigator may encounter any conceivable kind of
evidence. Investigators in the ﬁelds of law, history, and intelligence analysis must
be prepared to evaluate evidence having any conceivable substance. The problem
then is: How can we ever say anything general about evidence if it comes in so many
substantive varieties? One answer is provided if we choose to ignore its substance
and focus instead on its inferential properties. Two of the three evidence creden-
tials, relevance and credibility, supply us with a very useful scheme for classifying
evidence. This classiﬁcation scheme does allow us to say some general things about
evidence that apply regardless of the substance of the evidence.
As a fundamental basis for a substance-blind classiﬁcation of evidence that rests
only on inferential issues, we begin by considering two questions:
1 How does the user or evaluator of an item of evidence stand in relation to the
evidence? In answering this question we consider the form or type of evidence we
have. Can the user pick it up and look at it or observe it in some other way? Or, does
the evidence come from someone else who allegedly made some form of observation?
Answers to such questions suggest how we are to establish the credibility or
believability of the evidence.
2 How does the event reported in the evidence stand in relation to any probanda the
user is considering (including any ultimate or penultimate probanda)? This is a
relevance question. It is here that we must distinguish between evidence that has direct
relevance on some probandum and evidence whose relevance on a probandum is only
indirect. As we noted, in the latter case we will say that such evidence is ancillary.
Remember that ancillary evidence is either evidence about evidence or is evidence
about the strength or weakness of links in a chain of reasoning.
How any item of evidence is classiﬁed on an inferential basis is always relative to a
particular context and problem situation. An item of evidence judged to be relevant
in one inference task may not be so judged in another. Similarly, the credibility
of evidence and its sources are context-dependent. Our belief about a witness’s
credibilitymightchangeacrossdifferentcontextsinwhichthiswitnessmighttestify.
Relevance and credibility, as credentials of evidence, are not necessarily stationary.
During the course of work on some inferential matter, an analyst may have good
reasons for changing her mind about either the relevance or the credibility of an
item of evidence.

at different stages of work on a case. Finally, argument construction is a creative
act on your part. Thus, there is a natural subjective element in any classiﬁcation of
evidence. How you perceive some item of evidence in a given context might not be
so perceived by others, such as your opponent.
A substance-blind classiﬁcation of evidence, based on credibility and relevance
dimensions, is shown in Figure 2.8. Some forms of evidence we have identiﬁed
might not always be admissible in any trial. But this two-dimensional classiﬁcation
scheme has been useful in thinking about evidence in any context (law or elsewhere)
in which it might be used. In addition, you would certainly not disregard certain
evidence during fact investigation that you might not be able to get admitted at
trial. This evidence, such as objectionable hearsay statements, might have enormous
heuristic or abductive value in suggesting new hypotheses and new evidence that is
admissible.
The rows in Figure 2.8 arise when we consider how the user or evaluator stands
in relation to an item of evidence. In examining this dimension we must attend to
the physical properties of evidence, to the manner in which it came into existence,
and to the source(s) from which it was received.
First suppose the evidence is tangible in the sense that the user can in some
way examine it to determine what it reveals. In some cases the user can make such

Analysis of Evidence
a determination on her own. In other cases, however, the user might need the
assistance of an expert in order to determine what some item of tangible evidence
reveals. There are, of course, many different kinds of things we can examine for
ourselves including objects, documents, sensor images, measuring devices, and a
variety of representations such as maps, charts, diagrams, and so on. All of these
kinds of tangible evidence are open to our direct examination. What they actually
reveal in particular instances is not always immediately obvious.
The plus and minus signs under tangible evidence and under unequivocal testi-
monial evidence in Figure 2.8 are there to show that both forms of evidence have
another property that needs to be recognized. Such evidence can reveal either the
occurrence or the nonoccurrence of some event. Evidence revealing the occurrence
of some event is said to be positive evidence (+); that which reveals the nonoccur-
rence of events is said to be negative evidence (–). There are some important issues
here that bear upon the discovery or generation of evidence as well as upon the
inferential use of evidence.
There is no order of precedence between positive and negative evidence as far as
eithertheirrelevanceortheirprobativeforceareconcerned.Negativeevidence,such
as tangible or testimonial evidence about the nonoccurrence of an event, can be just
as relevant and inferentially forceful as positive evidence about the occurrence of
an event. It is common to focus on evidence regarding the occurrence of events and
easy to overlook evidence regarding the nonoccurrence of events. In any inferential
context, however, it may be as important to inquire about what did not happen as it
is to inquire about what did happen. In the mystery Silver Blaze, for example, only
Sherlock Holmes saw that the fact that the dog guarding the stable did not bark
supported an inference that the person who took the horse out of the stable was a
person with whom the dog was familiar.
Suppose that the evidence a user receives comes from another person in the form
of an assertion that some event of interest occurred or is true. It is customary to
call such evidence “testimonial.” The credibility of the person making the assertion
is always a possible source of doubt and for that reason testimonial evidence is
at least two inferential steps from the occurrence or nonoccurrence of events the
testimony is offered to support. The same is true with respect to tangible evidence –
its credibility attributes (authenticity, accuracy, and reliability) are possible sources
of doubt.
There may be even more inferential steps when the evidence is tangible. Sup-
pose that the tangible evidence is a document that the user can examine, such as
Agent Dawes’s memorandum in United States v. Able (pp. 23–27), and that what
is of interest in this document is Agent Dawes’s assertion that the accountant,
Timothy Cooper, had told him that papers in inactive client ﬁles had been lost
during his move to new ofﬁces in 2004. What is tangible is of course the document
and not the event to which it refers. In that situation, there are even more inferential

Fact investigation and the nature of evidence
75
When a person W testiﬁes about some event we are entitled to inquire about
how this person obtained her information about this event. Questions raised in
such inquiry are as varied as they are interesting. So, testimonial evidence from
a particular person can itself have different grounding. Did the person make a
direct observation, get the information at second hand, or is it merely an opinion
based on other observations? But testimonial evidence has other characteristics
we must recognize. In some situations witness W will give unequivocal testimony
that a certain event E did occur; W asserts: “Event E did occur.” Of course we
have uncertainty about whether or not E did occur even though W’s testimony is
not equivocal or is not hedged in any way. We have already examined some of the
speciﬁc sources of uncertainty we face as far as W’s credibility is concerned (veracity,
objectivity, and observational sensitivity).
In other situations a person may give testimony that is equivocal in nature. There
are at least two ways in which such equivocation may be expressed. In one case we
may ask W whether or not event E occurred and W responds by saying such things
as: “I couldn’t tell,” “I don’t remember,” or “I don’t know.” Such extreme equiv-
ocation may indicate an act of honest self-impeachment on W’s part; he actually
does not know or remember whether or not E occurred. However, W’s extreme
or complete equivocation is also consistent with the possibility that W does know
or can remember whether or not E happened but, for various reasons, refuses to
tell us. In other situations, however, W may hedge or equivocate in less extreme
ways. He may state, for example, “I believe it very probable that E did occur.” In
some situations he may attach speciﬁc numbers to grade the strength of his belief
regarding E; W might assert: “I am 70 per cent sure that E did occur.”
Either tangible or testimonial evidence rests, at some stage, upon someone’s
observations, your own or those of some other person. Again, if no person can be
identiﬁed who made a relevant observation of an object, event, or situation, our
hearing about the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an event may be classed as rumor
or gossip. But there are situations in which expected evidence is either not found
or is not produced on request and we began to inquire why this is so. Evidence
we regard as missing may be either tangible or testimonial in nature. An example
follows.
You take your car in for routine service and are astonished by the amount you are
charged. One expensive item involved replacement of your fuel pump. You ask to see
your original pump that was replaced and the mechanic tells you that he discarded
it and cannot show it to you. You might easily regard his failure to produce this
tangible evidence with some suspicion. Our failure to ﬁnd evidence where we expect
to ﬁnd it or the failure of persons to produce things or provide testimony can in
many cases be regarded as a form of evidence. It is quite important to note that
having no evidence about an event is not the same as having evidence that this event
did not occur. The distinction between negative evidence and missing evidence is
not always made. The distinction is captured by the old saying, “Evidence of absence
is not the same as absence of evidence.”

Analysis of Evidence
Finally, there are other kinds of information we often use as evidence that do not
rest upon someone’s direct observation. We make frequent use of records we regard
asauthoritativeandwealsotakecertainthingsforgrantedwithoutfurtherevidence.
In other words, we often make use of what may be regarded as accepted facts. One
form of authoritative record is an almanac that supplies information about the
time of sunrise, lunar phases or times of high and low tide. Other examples include
tablesofchemicalcompounds,physicalconstants,mathematicalformulae,andtidal
occurrences. If you used such information in an inference task you would ordinarily
not be obliged to prove that the information is trustworthy or that someone actually
observeditinsome way. You would, of course, be obligedtoprovethatyouextracted
the correct information from any such authoritative records. Other information
often used in an inference is normally accepted without further proof. For example,
you would not be obliged to provide further proof about such matters as: Heroin is
a narcotic substance; gasoline is a ﬂammable substance; or that the population of
New York City exceeds that of Omaha.
Before we consider the column dimension of the taxonomy in Figure 2.8 there
is a very important thing to note about the forms of evidence listed in the columns.
Evidence that we have may exist in the form of combinations of these evidence types.
For example, we might have a transcript of a deposition. This is a tangible document
that we can examine for ourselves. But this document is a record of testimony given
by a witness W. In this recorded testimony W reports that, as a result of a direct
observation, he believes that event E occurred at a certain time. Here, of course, we
have the authenticity of the document to be concerned about as well as the veracity,
objectivity, and observational sensitivity of witness W. Other combinations of the
types of evidence shown in the rows of Figure 2.8 are easy to imagine. In every case,
we may have some quite difﬁcult credibility matters to consider if we are to believe
what these combinations of types of evidence seem to reveal.
The columns in Figure 2.8 arise in response to the question: How does an
evidence item stand in relation to the matters at issue in a particular inference?
Answers to this question involve the nature of the relevance of the evidence. It
will be necessary for us to recall the distinction between directly and indirectly
relevant evidence that we illustrated by means of Figure 2.6. The evidence taxon-
omy in Figure 2.8 differs slightly from the one shown in another work (Schum,
1994, 114–20). This other taxonomy preserves a distinction that has often been
made between two forms of directly relevant evidence: direct evidence and cir-
cumstantial evidence. Evidence is often said to be direct if it goes in one rea-
soning step to a matter revealed in the evidence. If you believe the evidence to
be perfectly credible, that settles the matter. Evidence is said to be circumstan-
tial if, even though perfectly credible, it provides only some but not complete
grounds for belief in some probandum or proposition. In other words, circumstan-
tial evidence, even though perfectly credible, is always just inconclusive on some
probandum.

Fact investigation and the nature of evidence

Thereasonwhywehavenotmadeadistinctionbetweendirectandcircumstantial
evidence is that the term direct evidence has several major difﬁculties.18 To illustrate
these difﬁculties, we ﬁrst make use of two “rules” that have been proposed by Binder
and Bergman (1984, 77–82). Their two rules are:
Rule 1. All evidence is either direct or circumstantial.
Rule 2. There is no such thing as direct evidence.
The ﬁrst rule reﬂects the fact that a probandum or proposition on which an item
ofevidencemayseemdirectdependsonhowwehavestructuredtheargumentbased
on this evidence. Second, every argument can be further decomposed to reveal new
sources of doubt or uncertainty. Thus, there is arbitrariness associated with any
identiﬁcation of an item of evidence as being direct.
There is just a bit more to be said about ancillary evidence and its inferential use.
Recall that evidence is ancillary if it bears upon the strength or weakness of links
in a chain of reasoning for evidence being argued as directly relevant. It happens
that we must also defend, by argument, the relevance and credibility “credentials” of
ancillary evidence. The relevance at issue here concerns whether or not the ancillary
evidence we offer actually bears upon the generalizations we assert in defense of the
direct relevance of other evidence. The result is that we may often have complex
arguments associated with any defense of the relevance and credibility of ancillary
evidence.
AsFigure2.8shows,therearetenpossiblecombinationsoftherowsandcolumns.
Thus, for example, tangible evidence of some form might be either directly relevant
or ancillary in nature relative to some problem and within some particular chain
of reasoning. The same is true for the other four basic types of evidence in the
remaining rows. The major virtue of the evidence taxonomy we have just presented
isthatitallowsustocharacterizeanytypeofevidencewithoutregardtoitssubstance

Principles of proof
A. Introduction: evidence in legal contexts
Within the common law tradition there has been a tendency to equate the subject of
evidence with the law of evidence and to marginalize or neglect other dimensions
suchasthelogicofproof,witnesspsychology,theevidentiarysigniﬁcanceofforensic
science, and the role of statistics and of narrative in arguing about and deciding
contested issues of fact in legal contexts. In Part B, we ﬁrst describe the shared
assumptionsuponwhichevidencescholarshavebasedtheirworkfortwocenturies–
the Rationalist Tradition – and its importance in contemporary practice and then
describe and illustrate the principles that form the basis for the logic of proof.
Part C begins with Wigmore’s explanation for his view that mastery of the prin-
ciples of proof is at least as important as mastery of the rules regulating the admis-
sibility and use of evidence. Part D introduces some terminology basic to under-
standing those principles. The probative processes and logical principles necessary
for analyzing evidence and marshaling arguments in legal contexts are presented
and developed in Part E.
B. The Rationalist Tradition1
The common law model of adjudication reﬂects some basic assumptions – assump-
tions about the nature and proper ends of adjudication, assumptions about the
natureofknowledgeandthepossibilityofmakingaccuratepresentjudgmentsabout
past events, and assumptions about what is involved in reasoning about disputed
questions of fact in forensic contexts. The assumptions underlying contemporary
theory and practice, at least as reﬂected in the writings of those who have specialized
in the ﬁeld of evidence, have persisted with little apparent change since the eigh-
teenth century. Throughout, the accepted assumptions have generally conformed
to an ideal type that has been characterized as “the Rationalist Tradition.”
An understanding of these assumptions is important to practitioners as well as to
scholars.Theyprovidetheframeworkwithinwhichrulesofprocedureandevidence

will be debated in the future. They represent “ﬁrst principles” that can usefully be
employed by an advocate in urging that a speciﬁc rule of procedure or of evidence
should be construed in a manner that favors the outcome she seeks – that is, they
provide a basis for constructing arguments to persuade a court that the advocate’s
position is consistent with the assumptions upon which the system is based and
that her opponent’s is not.
An understanding of these assumptions serves further purposes for law students.

1. The tradition described
The central tenet of the Rationalist Tradition is that the primary objective of adjec-
tive(orprocedural)lawistheachievementof“rectitudeofdecision”inadjudication,
that is to say the correct application of law to facts proved to be true. That tenet has
threecorollariesthatbearuponthepresententerprise.First,withrespecttodisputed
questionsoffact,thetenetassumesthatrealizationofthatobjectiveinvolvesthepur-
suit of “truth” through rational means.2 That corollary requires assumptions of two
kinds – epistemological assumptions concerning the possibility of making accurate
present judgments about past events and reasoning assumptions concerning the
principles to be applied to maximize the likelihood that present judgments about
past events will be accurate. Second, the Rationalist Tradition reﬂects a persistent
recognitionthatpursuitoftruthhasahigh,butnotoverriding,priorityasameansto
secure justice under law (expletive justice). Third, the model of adjudication is itself
instrumentalist in that the pursuit of truth through reason is only a means to achiev-
ing the end of expletive justice viewed as the implementation of substantive law.
Given this central tenet, the characteristic assumptions of discourse about evi-
dence within the Rationalist Tradition can be succinctly stated: Epistemology is
cognitivist rather than skeptical; a correspondence theory of truth is generally pre-
ferred to a coherence theory of truth;3 the mode of decision-making is seen as
2 Critical theorists, postmodernists, and others argue that this is not how judges or juries, in fact,
resolve disputed questions of fact. See, e.g., Graham (1987); cf. Twining (1988); see also Nicolson
(1994), Siegel (1994). The main “strategies of scepticism” are discussed in Rethinking, Ch. 4. Even
they, however, would acknowledge that established rules require that decisions resolving such
questions must be rationally justiﬁable.
3 In the view of the authors, philosophical debates about coherence and correspondence theories of
truth are not crucially important in this context as the model is ﬂexible enough to accommodate
both kinds of theory. Historically most Anglo-American writers on evidence seem to have assumed
some correspondence assumptions (Bentham’s theory of ﬁctions being a notable exception). Our
own position approximates more closely to the “foundeherentism” of Haack (1993).

Analysis of Evidence
“rational,” as contrasted with “irrational” modes such as battle, compurgation, or
ordeal; the characteristic mode of reasoning is induction; and the pursuit of truth,
as a means to justice under the law, commands a high, but not necessarily an over-
riding, priority as a social value.
The basic assumptions that underlie the Rationalist Tradition are summarized
in the form of two models in table 3.1.
The ﬁrst model, Model I, reconstructs a “Rationalist Model of Adjudication”; the
second model, Model II, articulates the main epistemological and logical assump-
tions of standard evidence discourse to be found in specialized secondary writings
about evidence in the Anglo-American tradition. Part A of Model I is prescriptive:
It states an aspiration and a standard by which actual rules, institutions, procedures,
and practices may be evaluated. Acceptance of such standards involves no necessary
commitment to the view that a particular system, or some aspect of it, at a particular
time satisﬁes these standards either in its design or in its actual operation. Part B
of the model is intended to represent typical claims or judgments of the kind “on
the whole the system works well.” None of the leading theorists in the Rationalist
Tradition were perfectionists who expected one hundred per cent conformity with
the ideal. Some were highly critical of existing arrangements and practices.4
Ifthepropositionsofthesecondmodelrepresentstandardelementsinrationalist
theories of evidence, it should be clear that it is artiﬁcial to make a sharp distinction
between theories of evidence and theories of adjudication: Generally speaking, the
former presuppose or form part of the latter. Although there appears to be less of
a consensus in the relevant literature about the ends and the achievements of the
Anglo-American system of adjudication than about the logic and epistemology of
proof, it is possible to postulate a rationalist model of adjudication as an ideal type
that both ﬁts a rationalist theory of evidence and is recognizable as a reasonably
sophisticated version of a widely held, if controversial, view. The ﬁrst model is a
modiﬁed version of a Benthamite model of adjudication, presented in a way that
suggests a number of possible points of departure or disagreement. Although not
all leading evidence scholars have been legal positivists and utilitarians, a rationalist
theory of evidence necessarily presupposes a theory of adjudication that postulates
something like Bentham’s “rectitude of decision” as the main objective. There is
scope for divergence on a number of points of detail, but not from what might be
called the “rational core.”
It is reasonable, and sufﬁcient for present purposes, to assert that by and large
the leading Anglo-American scholars and theorists of evidence from Gilbert (1754)
to Wigmore (and, for the most part, until the present) have either implicitly or
explicitly accepted assumptions such as these, although not in this particular for-
mulation. Two ideas were shared by all. First, they accepted as given the view that
4 Indeed Bentham, whose Rationale of Judicial Evidence (1827) is the main source of the model,
made his theory of adjudication the basis for a radical and far-ranging critique of English (and, to
a lesser extent, Scottish and continental) procedure, practice, and rules of evidence in his day. See
Rethinking at 71–92.

the Anglo-American system has adopted a “rational” mode of determining issues of
fact in contrast with older “irrational” modes of proof. Second, a particular view of
“rationality”wasadoptedortakenforgranted.Thisviewfounditsclassicexpression
in English empirical philosophy in the writings of Bacon, Locke, and John Stuart
Mill.
ThisaccountoftheRationalistTraditionhasananalytical(aswellasanhistorical)
aspect. Analytically, it is an attempt to reconstruct in the form of an “ideal type”
an account of a set of basic assumptions about the aims and nature of adjudication
and what is involved in reasoning about disputed questions of fact in that context.
The test of success of this ideal type is its clarity, coherence, and usefulness as a
tool of analysis of evidence discourse and doctrine. But in applying this test, it is
important to distinguish between aspirational and complacent rationalism in respect
of adjudication. The claim that the modern system of adjudication is “rational” is a
statement of what is considered to be a feasible aspiration of the system; it does not
necessarily involve commitment to the view that this aspiration is always, generally,
or even sometimes, realized in practice. It is commonplace within the Rationalist
Tradition to criticize existing practices, procedures, rules, and institutions in terms
of their failure to satisfy the standards of this aspirational model.
It is also useful to differentiate a third category, which might be referred to as
optimistic rationalism. In invoking prescriptive standards, one often makes some
judgment about the prospects for attaining or approximating such standards in
practice in a given context. In the case of many writers on evidence and judicial
processwhoacceptedsomevariantofPartAoftherationalistmodelofadjudication,
it is reasonable to attribute to them the view that its standards represent a feasible
aspiration rather than a remote or unattainable Utopian ideal. Even virulently criti-
cal writers such as Bentham and Frank can be shown to have believed that their own
favored recommendations would in practice lead to signiﬁcant increases in the level
of rationality in adjudication. They were optimistic rationalists. In brief, almost
all the leading writers in the mainstream of Anglo-American evidence scholarship
were aspirational rationalists; most were optimistic rationalists most of the time;
and many, but by no means all, were fairly complacent about the general operation
of the adversary system in their own jurisdiction in their day.5
2. Principles of proof, rules of procedure and evidence,
and the Rationalist Tradition
Contemporary rules of procedure and evidence make it clear that the assumptions
identiﬁed in the Rationalist Tradition remain dominant today. Although a detailed
analysis is beyond the scope of this book, the importance of those assumptions in
understanding contemporary rules can be usefully illustrated here. We offer the
illustrations that follow for two reasons – to suggest perspectives that students
may wish to consider in studying the formal rules regulating procedure and the

available stock of knowledge about the common course of events; this is largely a
matter of common sense supplemented by specialized scientiﬁc or expert
knowledge when it is available.
7 The pursuit of truth (i.e. seeking to maximize accuracy in fact-determination) is
to be given a high, but not necessarily an overriding, priority in relation to other
values, such as the security of the state, the protection of family relationships, or
the curbing of coercive methods of interrogation.
8 One crucial basis for evaluating “fact-ﬁnding” institutions, rules, procedures,
and techniques is how far they are estimated to maximize accuracy in
fact-determination – but other criteria such as speed, cheapness, procedural
fairness, humaneness, public conﬁdence, and the avoidance of vexation for
participants are also to be taken into account.
9 The primary role of applied forensic psychology and forensic science is to
provide guidance about the reliability of different kinds of evidence and to
develop methods and devices for increasing such reliability.
Note: Prescriptive rationalism: acceptance of A as both desirable and reasonably feasible. No commitment to B.
Complacent rationalism: acceptance of A & B in re a particular system.

Analysis of Evidence
admissibility and use of evidence in the courts, and to aid students in understanding
the role that the principles of proof play in contemporary trial practice.
Contemporary rules clearly reﬂect the central tenets of the Rationalist Tradition,
although recent developments reﬂect a greater concern for ﬁnality and efﬁciency
with concomitant reduced concern for establishing the truth. Consider, for exam-
ple, the standards speciﬁed in the United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
Criminal Procedure, and Evidence. The rules governing civil cases are “to be con-
strued to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.”6
The rules governing criminal proceedings “are intended to provide for the just
determination of every criminal proceeding” and are to be “construed to secure
simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration, and the elimination of unjusti-
ﬁable expense and delay.”7 The rules regulating the admission and use of evidence
in both kinds of proceedings are to be “construed to secure fairness in administra-
tion, elimination of unjustiﬁable expense and delay, and promotion of growth and
development of the law of evidence to the end that truth may be ascertained and
proceedings justly determined.”8
In England, the contemporary rules of civil procedure reﬂect a similar shift. They
have been substantially reformed following the recommendations of Lord Woolf’s
Final Report on Access to Justice (1996). The main concern underlying these reforms
wastoreducecost,delay,andcomplexity;theprincipaloutcomehasbeentotransfer
the main responsibility for case management from the parties and their lawyers to
the courts. Some consider that the rules will have the tendency to sacriﬁce concern
for rectitude of decision to efﬁciency. Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1999)
(CPR) states:
Rule 1(1) These Rules are a new procedural code with the overriding objective of
enabling the court to deal with cases justly.
Rule 1.1(2) Dealing with a case justly includes, so far as is practicable: (a) ensuring that
the parties are on an equal footing; (b) saving expenses; (c) dealing with the case in ways
which are proportionate (i) to the amount of money involved; (ii) to the importance
of the case; (iii) to the complexity of the issues; (iv) to the ﬁnancial position of each
party; (d) ensuring that it is dealt with expeditiously and fairly; and (e) allotting to it an
appropriate share of the court’s resources, while taking into account the need to allot
resources to other cases.9
A detailed study of these US Federal Rules would raise interesting questions.
Each suggests or states that the ascertainment of truth and the correct application of
6 Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.
7 Fed. R. Crim. P. 2.
8 Fed. R. Evid. 102. The position in England is similar. For example, Professor Ian Dennis writes:
“Part of the aims of the law of evidence is therefore to articulate the constraints on the principle of
free proof which would be logically entailed by the rationalist model of adjudication. Some of the
criteria for constraint and their rationale are a matter of considerable and continuing controversy,
but certain points seem reasonably plain” (Dennis (2002) 27). Dennis then usefully considers these
constraints under four heads: (a) Expense and delay; (b) Procedural fairness; (c) Avoidance of error;
(d) Pursuit of other values (id. 23–29).

substantive law is an important objective. Each, however, also states that potentially
conﬂicting values, such as speed and the elimination of unjustiﬁable delay and
expense, are also to be taken into account. None says how the balance is to be struck
generally or in speciﬁc cases. Nor is it clear why the formulations in the three general
codesadoptedintheUnitedStatesthroughsimilarprocessesbythesameauthorities
are different or whether and to what extent the differences in language are intended
to have any practical consequences in application.
Partial answers to the questions that might be raised would require consideration
of the kinds of aspirations the rules reﬂect and the reactions generated by current
dissatisfaction with the seeming inability of the bench and bar to achieve them.
There are few complacent rationalists in modern society. No one seriously claims
that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have promoted “speedy and inexpensive
determinations in every action” that comes before the American federal courts.
Quite the contrary, many of those who now vigorously urge a turn to methods of
alternative dispute resolution can fairly be characterized as pessimistic rationalists
who think the aspirations of Model I can no longer be realized in the traditional
model of adjudication. The extent to which plea bargaining is the principal means
of resolving criminal proceedings reﬂects similar dissatisfaction on the criminal
side.
Another part of the answer, a more important part for those who expect to prac-
tice in the system, may emerge from an understanding that the process through
which the Federal Rules were formulated was political and the interests represented
in that process reﬂect divergent views as to how the balance should be struck.10 As
a practical matter, the rules ultimately adopted reﬂect political compromises, not
articulations of principles viewed as theoretically correct. In this context, two points
should be noted. First, ambiguity is a form of political compromise – the conﬂict
that cannot be resolved is deferred and left for case-by-case resolution in the courts.
Second, and perhaps related, the modern trend has been to expand the discretion
of the trial judge and to restrict the scope of review on appeal from decisions on
procedural or evidentiary matters. Thus, the political battle is legitimated and pro-
ceeds in the courts on a day-to-day, case-by-case basis. How discretion is exercised
in construing a rule may largely be a function of the social views of the particular
judge, tempered by the persuasiveness of counsel.
These points suggest some perspectives that students may ﬁnd useful in studying
procedural and evidentiary rules. First, modern rules of procedure and formal
rules of evidence are relatively recent phenomena. The very lack of complacency
10 The proceedings that led to the adoption of the Federal Rules of Evidence are described in the
Senate Judiciary Committee Report that accompanied the bill proposed to enact the rules. S. Rep.
No. 1277, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1974 U.S. Code, Cong. & Admin. News 7051–7052,

Wright & Graham (1977) §§5001–5006. Section 5006 deals directly with the drafting history. The
legislative history, including the statements of those who appeared at the hearings in the House and
Senate, is reproduced in Bailey and Trelles (1980). Amendments to the rules since their adoption
are listed in Federal Rules of Evidence (House Judiciary Committee Print 2003) at v–x available at

is reﬂected in the frequency with which these rules are amended. Anyone studying
such rules at a particular time should pay as much attention to the history of a
rule and the political processes by which it reached its present formulation as to
the text currently in force. The goal should be to understand the interests and
the compromises reﬂected in the rule. The rules are likely to change during any
practitioner’s career to reﬂect changes in the relative political power of those whose
interests are affected. In this view, the notes of the advisory committees, the Federal
Judicial Center, and the legislative committees concerning rules that were rejected
or amended at various stages and the proposals that were rejected may be more
revealing than the rule that was actually adopted. In England, both criminal and
civil evidence have been a recurrent focus of attention in the past thirty years.11
Second, something very similar to the prescriptive norms expressed in Model
I remain the norms that deﬁne the range within which contemporary debates are
conducted.Thosewhoargueforchangeordinarilyframetheirargumentstodemon-
strate that the changes they seek will enhance the likelihood that truth will be ascer-
tained without imposing further or undue costs or other burdens or, alternatively,
that the change will reduce the costs or other burdens or will promote fairness
in administration without signiﬁcantly diminishing the likelihood that truth will
be ascertained. Some contemporary theorists argue that the assumptions underly-
ing the model are ﬂawed and are merely political camouﬂage used to legitimate the
status quo and that changes are designed to protect or enhance it. Nonetheless, these
critics have yet to propose a serious alternative model.12 For that reason, proposals
for change and arguments for construction and application are likely to proceed
within the framework of the Rationalist Tradition for the foreseeable future. Thus,
as a practical matter, lawyers should develop the ability to use the prescriptive norms
effectively in argument.
Contemporary rules of procedure and evidence also make clear the centrality of
the principles of inductive reasoning and argument. The Federal Rules of Evidence
governing relevance may be fairly viewed as an attempt to codify the assumptions
underlying the rationalist theories of evidence and proof. For example, evidence
is relevant if and only if it has some “tendency to make the existence of any fact
that is of consequence to the litigation more probable or less probable than it
would be without the evidence.”13 That rule can only be viewed as mandating a
demonstration that requires the application of the principles of inductive logic to
persuade a judge that the evidence under consideration, alone or in combination
with other evidence, supports an inference or a chain of inferences that increases or
decreasesthelikelihoodthatafactofconsequenceistrue.Therulethatmandatesthe
admission of relevant evidence unless there exist speciﬁed grounds for its exclusion
assumes that truth is an objective that can be achieved through rational means and
establishes a base for assessing its priority in particular situations.14

Principles of proof

From that perspective, most of the remaining rules of evidence can be viewed
as falling into three categories – rules that justify the exclusion of evidence on the
ground that it has improper prejudicial effects that outweigh its probative value,15
rules that mandate or reﬂect a cost-beneﬁt analysis to prevent undue delay or con-
sumption of time,16 and rules that reﬂect extrinsic policies viewed as overriding the
ascertainment of truth as an objective.17 It should be clear that rules in the ﬁrst two
categories also typically require application of the principles of inductive reasoning
to identify the particular improper prejudice that evidence may generate and to
frame the arguments that bear upon a comparison of the legitimate probative value
and the illegitimate prejudicial effects in the particular case.
We develop the speciﬁc uses of the principles in constructing such arguments
later. For the moment, it should sufﬁce to note that the principles of practical
reasoning and the assumptions upon which they are based will remain central to
the common law model of adjudication, notwithstanding any changes that may be
made in the formal rules. For that reason, the ability to apply them in analysis and
argument is and will remain an essential lawyering skill.
C. Rationale
Wigmoreprovidedthestarting-pointofourwork,anditisimportanttounderstand
his conception of the subject of evidence in law and how its two main parts (the
principles of proof and the trial rules) are related. The following is his opening
statement at the start of The Science.
§1. What Is the Science of Judicial Proof? The study of the principles of Evidence,
for a lawyer, falls into two distinct parts. One is Proof in the general sense, – the part
concerned with the ratiocinative process of contentious persuasion, – mind to mind,
counsel to judge or juror, each partisan seeking to move the mind of the tribunal. The
other part is Admissibility, – the procedural rules devised by the law, and based on
litigious experience and tradition, to guard the tribunal (particularly the jury) against
erroneous persuasion. Hitherto, the latter has loomed largest in our formal studies, –
has, in fact, monopolized them; while the former, virtually ignored, has been left to the
chances of later acquisition, casual and empiric, in the course of practice. Here we have
been wrong; and in two ways.
15 The general principle is stated in Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Rules often have characteristics
that reﬂect justiﬁcations from more than one category. Rules 404 and 609, for example, may fairly
be viewed as codiﬁcations covering recurring situations where the improper prejudicial effects
presumptively outweigh the legitimate probative value, but these rules also reﬂect values unrelated
to the pure search for truth, such as the values expressed in the idea of judging “the act not the
actor.” See Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172 (1997); R. v. Sang [1980] A.C. 402 (Eng.).
16 See Rule 403 (the general principle); see also, e.g., Rules 405 (methods of proving character),
701–704 (opinions and expert testimony), 902 (self-authenticating documents).
17 The clearest examples are the rules protecting privileged communications, now reﬂected in
Rule 501, and the constitutional exclusionary rules adopted to regulate improper conduct by
law enforcement ofﬁcers without regard to the often dispositive probative value of the evidence
thereby excluded.

Analysis of Evidence
For one thing, there is, and there must be, a probative science – the principles of
proof – independent of the artiﬁcial rules of procedure; hence, it can be and should be
studied. This science, to be sure, may as yet be imperfectly formulated. But all the more
need is there to begin in earnest to investigate and develop it. Furthermore, this process
of Proof represents the objective in every judicial investigation. The procedural rules
for Admissibility are merely a preliminary aid to the main activity, viz., the persuasion
of the tribunal’s mind to a correct conclusion by safe materials. This main process is
that for which the jury are there, and on which the counsel’s duty is focused.
And, for another thing, the judicial rules of Admissibility are destined to lessen
in relative importance during the next period of development. Proof will assume the
important place; and we must therefore prepare ourselves for this shifting of emphasis.
We must seek to acquire a scientiﬁc understanding of the principles of what may be
called “natural” proof, – the hitherto neglected process . . .
The principles of Proof, then, represent the natural processes of the mind in dealing
with the evidential facts after they are admitted to the jury; while the rules of Admis-
sibility represent the artiﬁcial legal rules peculiar to our Anglo-American jury-system.
Hence the formershouldbestudiedﬁrst.Theybringinto play those reasoning processes
which are already the possession of intelligent and educated persons. They familiarize
the practitioner with the materials most commonly presented in trials at law, and thus
prepare him to take up more readily the artiﬁcial rules of Admissibility devised by
judicial experience for safeguarding legal investigations of fact.
Moreover, this process of Proof is after all the most important in the trial. The trial
culminates in either Proof or non-Proof. When the evidence is all in, the counsel sets
himself to his ultimate and crucial task, i.e. that of persuading the jury that they should
or should not believe the fact alleged in the issue. To do this, he must reason naturally,
as all men reason and as juries can be shown how to reason. He must have familiarized
himself with the logical processes which men naturally use, and with general experience
as to the classes of inferences commonly called for in legal trials. Here he has no use for
the artiﬁcial rules of Admissibility. Those have been disposed of, at the outset, by the
judge.Theevidenceisin,andthequestionnowis,Whatisitseffect?Alltheartiﬁcialrules
of Admissibility might be abolished; yet the principles of Proof would remain, so long as
trials remain as a rational attempt to seek the truth in legal controversies . . . (Wigmore,
Science §1 and 2)
Notes and questions on rules of evidence concerning relevance
1. The deﬁnition of relevance is the law’s codiﬁcation of the principles of logic.
Consider the following provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence:
Rule 401. Deﬁnition of “Relevant Evidence.” “Relevant evidence” means evidence having
any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the deter-
mination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the
evidence.18
18 Strictly speaking, the only facts of consequence in a case are the penultimate probanda (including
any probanda asserting an afﬁrmative defense) and probanda undermining or reinforcing the
credibility of evidence that is relevant to a penultimate probandum.

Rule 402. Relevant Evidence Generally Admissible: Irrelevant Evidence Inadmissible. All
relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the
United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the
Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority. Evidence which is not relevant is not
admissible.
To what extent are the foregoing provisions a codiﬁcation of principles of
“proof”? Are any of the provisions rules of “admissibility”? Would archeologists,
historians, and scientists accept the law’s deﬁnition of relevance for application in
their ﬁelds? What provisions of the rule deal with problems that are peculiar to
courts?
2. Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is central. It provides:
Rule 403. Exclusion of Relevant Evidence on Grounds of Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of
Time. Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially
outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading
the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation
of cumulative evidence.
Rule403prescribesa“probativeequation”thetrialcourtmustapplyindetermin-
ing whether an individual evidential proposition should be admitted. The unfair,
misleading, or other improper prejudicial effects (PE) of the proffered evidential
data must be identiﬁed and appraised. The legitimate probative value (PV) must
be determined and weighed. Then the court must determine whether the improper
prejudicial effects substantially outweigh the legitimate probative value – whether
PE ≫PV.
a What effects are improperly prejudicial? How should we measure the legitimate
probative value?
b Consider propositions 11 and 21 from the exercise at pages 41–43 above. The ultimate
proposition to be proved is that “It was X who murdered Y.” The prosecutor wishes to
offer evidence to show that:
11 X has two convictions for shoplifting; the most recent occurred ﬁve years ago.
21 Z [an alibi witness for X] is a prostitute.
Is evidence that supports either proposition relevant? If so, to what “fact that is
of consequence” in an action to determine whether “It was X who murdered Y”?
Be precise. Would a scientist or an historian consider either proposition relevant?
Should either or both propositions be admissible under Rule 403? State the analysis
in support of and in opposition to admission precisely.
3. Article IV of the Federal Rules of Evidence is entitled Relevancy and its Limits.
Consider Rule 404.
Rule 404. Character Evidence Not Admissible to Prove Conduct; Exceptions; Other Crimes
(a) Character evidence generally. Evidence of a person’s character or a trait of his
character is not admissible for the purpose of proving that he acted in conformity
therewith on a particular occasion, except;

Analysis of Evidence
(i) Character of accused. Evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an
accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same; . . .
(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not
admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in
conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as
proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or
absence of mistake or accident.19
Is Rule 404 a codiﬁcation of a principle of proof or a rule restricting admissibility
and use of logically relevant evidence? If it is a rule of admissibility, what values are
served by this departure from the goal of “truth ascertainment”? Consider again
propositions 11 and 22 set out above. Would Rule 404 require the exclusion of
evidence offered to prove either or both propositions? Does Rule 404 suggest a
policy that might enhance an argument that either or both propositions should in
any event be excluded under Rule 403?
D. Notes on terminology and inferential relationships
In any inquiry that seeks to determine what happened based upon evidence, the
person conducting the inquiry must have or develop a hypothesis to be tested (some-
times framed as a question to be answered). Although the hypothesis will often be
reﬁned during the investigation and analysis, a meaningful analysis can not be taken
without a preliminary hypothesis. In determining whether evidence is relevant, the
analyst must answer the question, “Relevant to what?” The “what” is the hypothesis.
In legal contexts, the hypothesis is established by the governing law. In other
words, assuming the applicable rule of law is clear, the proposition to be proved is a
proposition that includes each of the material facts that must be proved in order to
satisfy the conditions speciﬁed by the rule. Wigmore adopted and adapted the Latin
term “factum probandum” (or simply “probandum”) to designate a proposition to
be proved.
If one views the applicable rule of law as the major premise in a deductive
argument,thentheultimateprobandumistheminorpremise.Forexample,atypical
statute deﬁning murder might read, “Murder is the unlawful killing of a human
being . . . with malice aforethought.” That statute might be restated as the major
premise of a syllogism as:
If a human being (a victim) is dead, and the victim died as a result of an unlawful
act, and it was the accused who committed the act that caused the victim’s death, and
the person who committed the act acted with malice aforethought, then the accused is
guilty of murder.
In a murder case, the ultimate probandum would be the proposition that satisﬁed
the requirements of the rule as restated. In “An investigation” presented in Chapter 1
19 On character evidence in England, see Dennis (2002) Ch. 18; Zander (2003) 413–33.

at pp. 40–43, the ultimate probandum the prosecution would have to prove might
be stated as:
UP:
Y is dead; and Y died as a result of an unlawful act; and it was X who
committed the act that caused Y’s death; and X acted with malice afore-
thought in committing the act.20
The illustrations that follow draw upon propositions given in that exercise. To limit
the need to refer back, propositions used here have been renumbered.
In almost all instances, an ultimate probandum that is stated in formal terms
is a compound statement, a statement containing more than one simple proposi-
tion. Under any method of analysis one of the ﬁrst steps requires that the analyst
divide (and sometimes subdivide) the ultimate probandum into simple proposi-
tions, what Wigmore called and we will refer to as the “penultimate probanda.” Thus,
the penultimate probanda in “An investigation” were that:
1 Y is dead.
2 Y died as the result of an unlawful act.
3 It was X who committed the act that caused Y’s death.
4 X acted with malice aforethought in committing the act.
A penultimate probandum is a synonym for familiar terms used in other legal
contexts. A penultimate probandum is a material fact. (The terms fact-in-issue and
ultimate fact are synonyms in this context.) A penultimate probandum is also a
fact of consequence, but the term fact of consequence includes more than just the
penultimate probanda in a case. For example, when a witness takes the stand her
credibility becomes a fact of consequence. So too, inferred propositions, such as the
accused had motive or had opportunity, are often called facts of consequence.21
All evidential data presented at trial must be presented in a form that the triers
of fact can perceive with their senses. This evidence consists of only two types: testi-
monial assertions made by a witness from the witness stand, that is, oral statements
the triers of fact actually hear, and physical objects displayed to the triers of fact or,
rarely, other forms of evidential data that can be perceived by one or more of the
senses.22
To avoid confusion, it is important to have terms that enable us to distinguish
evidential data that the jurors (or other decision-makers) will perceive with one
of their senses – will hear, see, smell, taste, or touch – from the propositions that
the jurors will be asked to infer from those data. Specialized terminology is helpful
20 In that problem, the police cadet had an assigned standpoint. He was a police cadet assigned, at
the outset of the investigation, to analyze information as it was developed. One of the hypotheses
the evidence suggested was, “It was X who committed the act that caused Y’s death.” (Standpoint
is an important concept that is developed fully in Ch. 4.)
21 See above, n. 18.
22 Stipulated, admitted, or judicially noticed facts might be considered a third class, but these facts
are actually inferences that triers of fact are instructed to accept as proven.

Analysis of Evidence
because the terms “fact” and “evidence” have many overlapping and imprecise
meanings. For example, a lawyer might properly argue that:
a
the fact that X had a motive to murder Y is evidence that X did murder Y.
b
the fact X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m., the time and place of Y’s murder, is evidence
that X had opportunity to murder Y.
c
W3’s testimony that he saw X running out of Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. is evidence that
W exited Y’s house at 4:45 p.m., which in turn is evidence that X was in Y’s house at
4:30 p.m.
Most listeners would understand each of these assertions notwithstanding the fact
that the words “fact” and “evidence” had a different meaning in each.
In a trial, W3’s testimonial assertion about X’s departure would be an evidential
datum – an assertion the trier of fact would hear. The existence of an evidential
datum cannot be contested. For example, if a witness testiﬁed, “The moon is made
of green cheese,” the fact that the statement was made could not be disputed. But
no one would accept the inference that the moon is in fact made of green cheese.
Instead, most would infer that the witness was lying or was crazy or had a strange
sense of humor.
Wigmore adopted the term autoptic proference to describe an evidential datum
that the decision-makers will perceive with one of their ﬁve senses.23 In the chapters
thatfollow,theterms autoptic proference or evidential datum areusedtoidentifyevi-
dence that the fact-ﬁnder will hear or see or otherwise perceive through their senses.
An autoptic proference is only relevant if it makes a fact of consequence more
or less probable than it would be in the absence of the autoptic proference. A fact
of consequence is always a proposition to be inferred, a factum probandum. It is
rare, however, that a penultimate probandum can be directly inferred from an
autoptic proference. In almost all instances, there are one or more intermediate
propositions, probanda, that must be accepted in order to demonstrate the logical
relationship between the evidential datum and the penultimate probandum it is
offered to support.
Wigmore also used the term “factum probans” to describe an inferential propo-
sition that is offered as support for a further inference, a factum probandum. It is
important to note the terms “factum probans” and “factum probandum” can refer
to the same proposition. Using this terminology, an autoptic proference is offered
to support a factum probandum, which then becomes a “factum probans” offered to
supportafurther“factumprobandum.”Wehavedroppedtheword“factum,”butthe
terms “probans” and “probandum” are used throughout the remainder of the book.
The point can be illustrated using propositions presented in “An investigation.”
For example, from proposition 2, renumbered proposition 5 here, we may assume
that at trial:
23 This admittedly awkward term is more precise and broader than the commonly used “real
evidence,” which is ambiguous.

5 W1 will testify, “I saw a person with characteristics a, b, c, and d enter Y’s house at
4:15 p.m. on January 1.”
From this autoptic proference, we must ﬁrst infer the truth of the matter asserted:
6 A person with characteristics a, b, c, and d entered Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1.
Standing alone, neither the testimonial assertion, an autoptic proference, nor the
inferred proposition is relevant to the provisional penultimate probandum:
3 It was X who murdered Y.
But there is another autoptic proference, the appearance of X, that the decision-
maker would see,
7 X
From which she might infer,
8 X has characteristics a, b, c, and d.
The decision-maker might then combine inferred proposition 5 and 6, now each a
probans, to support a further probandum:
9 It was X who entered Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1.
An advocate might urge that proposition 9 supports a further inference:
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.
based upon a generalization:
11 People who enter a house usually remain for more than ﬁfteen minutes.
That advocate could then argue that the assumed proposition 12 (based on propo-
sition 1 in “An investigation”),
12 Y died in his home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1 as the result of an unlawful act
committed by another person,
combines with inferred proposition 10 to support a further inference,
13 X had an opportunity to commit the act that caused Y’s death,
which in turn makes the fact of consequence, penultimate probandum 3 above,
3 It was X who committed the act that caused Y’s death,
somewhat more probable than it would in the absence of the autoptic proferences
set out in propositions 5 and 6.
It may be easier to understand the relationships among these propositions if they
were depicted in charted form. This can be done using three of the symbols used in
the “Chart method of analysis” which is presented in the next chapter. A testimonial

Analysis of Evidence
assertion that the tribunal will hear from the witness stand is always depicted by a
square –
. All other propositions are depicted by a circle –⃝.Autopticproferences,
as opposed to inferred propositions, are identiﬁed by placing an inﬁnity symbol –
∞– beneath the square or circle representing an assertion the fact-ﬁnder will hear
or a circle depicting an item of evidence that the fact-ﬁnder will see or perceive with
one of her other senses.
The distinction between “inference” and “proof” also needs to be clariﬁed. An
“inference” represents an argument or a claim that there is a logical relationship
between two propositions, that one proposition supports the other. In the chart pre-
sented below, the relationships depicted show the inferential relationships among
the propositions in the keylist. “Proof” (or non-proof) is the result – the con-
clusion to be reached after the inferences have been evaluated.24 If we accept the
claim that, reasoning from the “bottom up,” each of the propositions depicted in
the chart makes the proposition above it in some degree more probable than it
would be in the absence of the supporting proposition, then we have to concede
that the chart accurately depicts the inferential relationships among the charted
propositions. That commitment does not entail any commitment to the conclusion
that the charted propositions “prove” the penultimate probandum to any speci-
ﬁed degree of probability, such as more probable than not or beyond reasonable
doubt. Inferential reasoning and argument is the process; proof or non-proof is the
result.
A preliminary exercise: State v. Archer (I)
A murder has just been reported and the investigation just begun. You are the
prosecuting attorney. The murdered man was named Vern. Detective Paul was
the investigating ofﬁcer. Detective Paul’s preliminary report contains the following
assertion: “I found a scrap of brown Harris tweed cloth clutched in Vern’s right
hand.”Thescrapofclothhasbeenproperlytaggedandpreservedforuseasevidence.
1 Why are Paul’s assertion and the scrap of cloth relevant? Formulate as simple
propositions the testimonial assertions Detective Paul might make. Formulate the
propositions that must be inferred to demonstrate that the autoptic proferences are
relevant to a fact of consequence. Using the preliminary charting scheme suggested
above, chart the tentative inferences that you would make from this assertion and
from the scrap of cloth to guide Detective Paul’s investigation.
2 As a matter of logical process, does the analysis of the available evidence from the
investigator’s standpoint differ from that of the lawyer immediately before trial? If so,
how? If not, why not?
24 There are standards of proof that are to guide the fact-ﬁnder in deciding in whose favor the verdict
or judgment in a case should be returned, and there are standards that deﬁne the limits of the
fact-ﬁnder’s discretion in making that decision. These subjects are addressed in Ch. 8 below.

Analysis of Evidence
E. Probative processes and logical principles
1. Probative processes
Wigmore categorized the main relations between evidentiary propositions in terms
of the probative processes for which they might be offered – proponent’s assertion
(PA),opponent’sdenial(OD),opponent’srival(OR),opponent’sexplanation(OE),
and proponent’s corroborations (PC). These categories establish a vocabulary that
is frequently useful in identifying, advancing, and appraising claims that evidence
or factual arguments are relevant in particular phases of a case.
When a party offers an autoptic proference at trial, she is a proponent claim-
ing that proffered data support an assertion that is relevant. That is a proponent’s
assertion (PA). In most instances, the proponent must also claim that that ini-
tial assertion supports a further assertion (an interim probandum), which in turn
supports a further assertion and so on, until the logical basis for the claim that
the proffered datum makes a fact of consequence more or less probable has been
demonstrated. In the illustration developed above, the prosecution would offer, as
autoptic proferences, propositions 5 and 7 to support proponent’s assertions 6, 8,
and 9. See key-list and chart 3.1 above.
There are three, and only three, ways that the opposing party, the defendant,
could challenge these assertions. He may deny one or more of them, opponent’s
denial (OD); he may offer evidence supporting a conﬂicting rival proposition (OR);
or he may offer alternative explanations for the proffered datum and inferences,
opponent’s explanation (OE).
If the investigation begun in “An investigation” proceeded to trial, X might, for
example, testify,
14 I did not enter Y’s house at any time on January 1,
supporting an inference,
15 X did not enter Y’s house at any time on January 1.
Such a testimonial assertion would be classiﬁed as an opponent’s denial (OD)
because it denies the truth of the inference based upon the testimonial assertion
that would be made by W2 based upon proposition 4 in “An investigation,”
16 W2: I saw X leave Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. on January 1,
supporting a proponent’s assertion offered by the prosecution,
17 X departed from Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. on January 1,
providing additional support for
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.
X might also offer autoptic proferences supporting an opponent’s rival assertion
(OR) based upon proposition 12 in “An investigation”:
18 X: I was in a house ﬁve miles from the scene of the murder from 2 p.m. until 5 p.m.,

supporting an inference, whose strength would depend upon an assessment of X’s
credibility,
19 X was in a house ﬁve miles from the scene of the murder from 2 p.m. until 5 p.m.,
which would rival the proponent’s inferred assertion,
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.
Finally, X might offer one or more alternative explanations that weaken the pro-
bative value of the proponent’s assertion, an opponent’s explanation (OE). There
are two types of opponent’s explanations. The ﬁrst calls attention to alternative
inferences that the proffered datum would also support. For example, in “An inves-
tigation,” W3 would testify (P6),
20 On Christmas Day, I heard X say angrily to Y: “I shall not forget this,”
which the prosecutor might assert supports the inferred assertion,
21 X was angry with Y on Christmas Day,
supporting a further inference,
22 X’s anger with Y continued until January 1,
supporting a further inference,
23 X’s anger gave him a motive to murder,
supporting the penultimate probandum,
3 It was X who committed the act that caused Y’s death.
However, without further evidence, it is clear that there are a number of plausible
alternative explanations for X’s assertion that are too trivial to support a claim of
motive, e.g.,
24 Y may have forgotten to send X a Christmas card, or
25 Y may have embarrassed X at a party or a business meeting,
and so on – and thus tending to explain away and weaken the prosecutor’s claim.
Opponent’s explanations of this kind are implicit in the content or the context from
which the proponent’s assertion arises and require no other evidential support.
The second kind of opponent’s explanation requires further evidence. For exam-
ple, if the charge that X murdered Y proceeded to trial, counsel for the defense might
undermine the probative value of W1’s assertion (P2) that she saw a person with
characteristics a, b, c, and d enter Y’s house through cross-examination. If that
examination forced W1 to admit,
22 W1: I have poor eyesight and was not wearing my glasses on January 1, and
23 W1: It was dark and it was foggy at 4:15 p.m. on January 1,

Analysis of Evidence
counsel could argue that this ancillary evidence supported an opponent’s explana-
tion that W’s assertion should be discounted because W’s observational sensitivity
was impaired.
As Wigmore summarized them, the ﬁve probative processes applicable to any
piece of evidence are:
PA = proponent’s assertion of a fact to evidence a probandum;
OE = opponent’s explanation of other facts taking away the value of this inference PA;
OD = opponent’s denial of the evidentiary fact on which the inference PA is based;
OR = opponent’s rival fact, adduced against the probandum, without any reference to
the inference PA;
PC = proponent’s corroborative facts, negating the explanations OE.
(Science (1937) 46)
2. The logical principles
In the adversarial system, all decisions resolving disputed questions of fact must be
rationally justiﬁable. This requirement has two necessary corollaries:
1 The principles of logic – abductive, inductive, and deductive – can be applied to any
mass of data that constitutes evidence from which we wish to reconstruct past events
in order to resolve disputed questions of fact.
2 The propositions established by these data and those proffered as possible inferred
propositions can be articulated and can be organized and marshaled as arguments
bearing upon the resolution of such disputed questions of fact.25
Some of the principles underlying abductive logic and their application in the
investigative phase of any process were presented and illustrated in Chapter 2. They
are developed and illustrated here in the context of their application in the legal
process.
a. Abductive reasoning. The lawyer must use abductive reasoning in various situ-
ations. Early in a case, for example, a lawyer is typically confronted with sparse data
or with data supplied by a biased source, the client. The lawyer must ask questions
of the data: What hypotheses might account for these data that would be consis-
tent with a result that would advance (or protect) the client’s interests? Given the
plausible hypotheses, what additional data should be available to conﬁrm or negate
them? Frequently, the answers are not apparent. Similarly creative speculation and
testing is frequently required when the lawyer is thinking about data that cannot be
accounted for by any of the provisional theories under consideration or about data
that will support the opposing side’s case unless it can be otherwise explained. What
the lawyer needs to do in such situations is imagine or construct new hypotheses
or possible solutions that may satisfactorily account for the data and then discover
25 For a fuller discussion of the principles and their signiﬁcance to the adversarial model of adjudi-
cation, see Anderson (1991).

sources from which additional evidence to test these hypotheses or solutions might
be obtained. This is creative lawyering.
The materials in Chapter 1 included illustrations of abductive reasoning. The
“Intelligence analyst” was designed to illustrate abductive reasoning (see pages
3–8). In one interpretation, Solomon employed abductive reasoning in identi-
fying the sword as a useful tool to generate additional evidence that would aid
him in deciding the question before him (see pages 2–3). Kemelman and Welt
were engaging in abductive reasoning throughout their analysis in “The Nine Mile
Walk,” especially when they searched for ways to set up and test the hypothesis
that the statement concerning a “nine mile walk” reﬂected events that had actually
occurred (see pages 11–18). The exercises in “An investigation” were designed to
require the police cadet to engage in abductive reasoning at several stages (see pages
40–45). Although not the focus, each of the other exercises in Chapter 1 contains
illustrations of abductive logic or requires its use to “solve” the problem presented
or both.
After discovery is over26 and all planned investigations have been completed, the
lawyer is confronted with the task of analyzing the available evidence to identify,
construct, and appraise arguments that can be used to persuade the tribunal that
the necessary ultimate probandum has or has not been proved with the degree of
certainty required by the applicable standard of proof.27 In theory, the evidence
is as complete as it can be, and the lawyer is only required to analyze a ﬁxed and
deﬁned mass of data. The primary method of reasoning required at this stage is
inductive reasoning: Can the data be marshaled to provide compelling support for
the inferred propositions necessary to the client’s success in the case at hand?
There is, however, a continuing need for abductive reasoning in preparing for

to identify an opponent’s explanations that she may use to explain away assertions
based upon evidential data the opposing party is likely to offer and to identify
explanations that she must anticipate opposing counsel may suggest to weaken or
undermine assertions based upon evidential data she will offer. At the trial stage,
the lawyer can invoke the process of opponent’s explanation (OE) to suggest to the
tribunal alternative hypotheses that might explain away damaging evidence offered
by her opposing counsel. After the trial has begun, however, it is ordinarily too late
to seek new evidence that might support one or more of those explanations and
make it a true rival that might more effectively undermine the proponent’s case.

Induction becomes central when the possibilities have been identiﬁed and explored
and the data are as complete as is feasible. The unexamined possibility ﬁrst seen
and raised at trial is ordinarily a sign of desperation or inadequate preparation.

Analysis of Evidence
b. Deductive reasoning. Deductive logic is the process by which we apply a univer-
sal major premise to a particular factual proposition, a minor premise. The classic
illustration is: All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore, Socrates is a mortal.
If the major and minor premises are true, it necessarily follows that the conclu-
sion is true. In a legal case, the applicable rule of law is the major premise and the
ultimate probandum is the minor premise. In the last section, we presented a rule
of law deﬁning murder, a major premise, and the ultimate probandum that must
be proved to satisfy that rule, a minor premise (at pages 90–91). If the ultimate
probandum was true, then it would necessarily be the case that the accused is guilty
of murder.
c. Inductive reasoning28 In analyzing the available evidential data and identify-
ing and marshaling the inferences that those data support in preparing for trial,
the lawyer relies primarily on inductive reasoning. The examples drawn from “An
investigation” developed in the preceding section (at pages 96–98) illustrated the
process of inductive reasoning. The nature of that form of reasoning is developed
further in the discussion of generalizations that follow.
d.Generalizations.Thereisanecessaryrelationshipbetweendeductiveandinduc-
tive reasoning that every lawyer should understand.29 The primary mode of rea-
soning in analyzing the relationships between a speciﬁed mass of evidential data
and a proposition to be proved may be inductive, but effective analysis of those
relationships requires the application of a form of quasi-deductive reasoning.
Wigmore noted the essential point:
[E]very inductive inference is at least capable of being transmuted into and stated in
the deductive form, by forcing into prominence the implied law or generalization on
which it rests more or less obscurely. (Science (1937) 21)
The point requires further development.
i. The importance of generalizations.30 “Generalizations . . . represent the glue that
hold our arguments together” (Schum (1994) 82). Every inference is dependent
upon a generalization. The inductive form of an inference can be converted to a
quasi-deductive form by identifying and articulating the generalization upon which
it depends. Thus, classically, Descartes’s “I think; therefore I am” depends on the
generalization that might be formally stated as “All persons who think are persons
who exist” and converted to a syllogistic form:
All persons who think are persons who exist.
I am a person who thinks.
Therefore, I am a person who exists.31
28 We follow Wigmore and John Stuart Mill in using “induction” to refer to inferential reasoning
that, in this context, is mainly concerned with reasoning towards and justifying conclusions about
particular past events. See generally Walton (1989) and (2002).
29 This is also true of abductive logic. See above at pages 56–58.
30 The roles generalizations play in analysis and argument are explored in greater depth in Ch. 10.
31 Or, to parallel Descartes’s elegant simplicity: All who think are; I think; therefore, I am.

In practice, it is rare that the generalization upon which the justiﬁcation for an
inference depends is a universally true proposition. Usually they have fuzzy quan-
tiﬁers such as, “people who enter a house usually remain for more than ﬁfteen
minutes.”
In most contexts, inductive reasoning operates intuitively. The reasoner does
not consciously identify the generalizations upon which her inferences depend,
unless she is required to justify her conclusions. Even then, she will often ﬁnd
it hard, probably impossible, to articulate the precise generalization upon which
an inference relied, as opposed to articulating an after-the-fact generalization that
she believes justiﬁes her conclusion. For example, a student might report to her
teacher that her friend John did not attend class today because his car would not
start, urging the teacher to conclude that John’s absence should be excused because
it was caused by circumstances beyond his control. The teacher might inquire,
“How do you know his car would not start?” The student might reply, “Because
John told me so.” The teacher might continue the inquiry: “Why does the fact
that he told you his car would not start justify the conclusion that his car, in fact,
would not start?” Forced to justify her inference, she might claim, “Based upon my
past experience with John, I believe John’s assertions are almost always true and
accurate.”
In a legal context, it is frequently important to identify the generalization upon
which an inference depends to determine the strength or the plausibility of the
inference and to identify potential fallacies. Both the importance and the potential
dangers can be simply illustrated.
Many people would accept the generalization, “In most instances, a person who
has committed a violent crime will ﬂee from the scene of that crime.” In “An inves-
tigation,” the cadet learns (P4): “W2 says that he saw X, who was known to him,
running out of Y’s home at 4:45 p.m. on January 1.” Y was murdered in the house at
4:30 p.m. and proposition 4 supports an inference that X was ﬂeeing from the scene
of that crime shortly after it was committed. If the generalization identiﬁed above
were applicable, the cadet might argue that this shows it is likely that X murdered Y.
But that argument would be fallacious. The generalization so framed cannot log-
ically be applied to justify that inference. The only basis upon which an inference
from X’s “ﬂight” to X’s guilt can be justiﬁed is by the far weaker generalization: “In
some instances, a person ﬂeeing from the scene of a serious crime is the person who
has committed that crime.”32 Given the number of plausible explanations, other
than guilt, why someone might ﬂee from the scene of a violent crime, the evidence
provides, at best, only weak support for the inference that X murdered Y.
32 The more detailed “ﬂight” chain of inferences is: “Analytically, ﬂight is an admission by conduct,
and its probative value as circumstantial evidence of guilt depends on the degree of conﬁdence
with which four inferences can be drawn: (1) from defendant’s behavior to ﬂight; (2) from ﬂight
to consciousness of guilt; (3) from consciousness of guilt to consciousness of guilt concerning the
crime charged; and (4) from consciousness of guilt concerning the crime charged to actual guilt
of the crime charged.” U.S. v. Myers, 550 F.2d 1036. 1039 (5th 1977) (noted as leading case in
McCormick on Evidence, §263 (1999)).

Analysis of Evidence
ii. A note on the nature of generalizations. Generalizations can be classiﬁed using
three axes – a generality axis, a reliability axis, and a source axis. The end points
of the generality axis are marked by generalizations in the most abstract form and
generalizations that have been made speciﬁc to the precise case or context in which
they are to be applied. For example, the abstract, “In some instances a person seen
ﬂeeing from the scene of violent crime may be guilty of that crime,” as opposed to
the context speciﬁc, “It is possible that a person dressed in a suit and tie who was
seen emerging from a ten-unit apartment building and walking rapidly toward a
bus stop 100 yards from the building shortly after a victim had been brutally beaten
with a hammer in that building may be guilty of the crime.”
At one end of the reliability axis are scientiﬁc laws (such as the law of gravity);
well-founded scientiﬁc opinions (such as the conclusions of a qualiﬁed forensic
expert based upon comparison of specimens of handwriting alleged to have been
writtenbythesameindividual);andwidelysharedconclusionsbaseduponcommon
experience (for instance, everyone knows that a driver must stop for a red light). In
the middle are commonly held, but unproven or unprovable, beliefs (for instance,
ﬂeeing the scene of a crime is evidence of a guilty conscience). At the other end
are biases or prejudices that may be strongly held irrespective of available data (for
instance, women do not make good trial lawyers; men are generally poor single
parents; whites cannot fairly sit as jurors when a black is on trial, etc.) and less
strongly held but still operative beliefs (for instance, a person’s actions usually
conform to her motives).
Finally, the source axis may range from generalizations based upon repeated
personal experience to those based on acquired knowledge to “synthetic/intuitive”
generalizations33 whose source the person formulating the generalizations cannot
identify. Based upon personal experience, the authors believe that, “In Miami,
Florida,thesunshinesforsomeperiodoftimeonmostdaysoftheyear.”Basedupon
their studies the authors believe, “Gravitational force is proportional to the masses,
and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.” Although
none of the authors could identify its source, each accepts the generalization, “In
some instances a person seen ﬂeeing from the scene of a violent crime is the person
who committed that crime.”
Wigmorean analysis provides a technique for identifying and making explicit the
generalizations involved at each step of an argument. At the same time, that analysis
maycumulativelyseemlikeaninvitationtoextremeskepticism.Itregularlyprovides
strong ammunition for attacking an opponent’s argument and for questioning one’s

ever be strong. However, after doing some exercises they usually conclude that it is
possibletoconstructcogentargumentsthatcanevensatisfythestandardof“beyond

A good lawyer must be able to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of
his or her own case as well as those of an opponent’s case. For present purposes
it is sufﬁcient to note that, in legal contexts, reliance upon generalizations that fall
far short of certainty is an inevitable aspect of even the strongest case. The com-
mon law model of adjudication assumes as much, and rarely will an argument be
of any value if it is limited to demonstrating that one’s opponent’s case falls short
of perfection. The skepticism of the disappointed perfectionist has little value in
a system that is explicitly based upon standards that require only less than perfect
proof. In litigation, the question is not “Is it certain?”, but rather, “Does it con-
form to the best available judgment that can be reached based upon the evidence
provided in light of the stock of knowledge and beliefs commonly held in the par-
ticular society at the time the case is tried?” In that context, Wigmorean analysis
simply provides analytic tools for identifying and analyzing background general-
izations. The capacity to use those tools effectively is an essential part of sound
lawyering.
3. Application of the principles in legal disputes
An offer of evidence always involves one (or more) of the probative processes Wig-
more described – assertion, explanation, rival, denial, or corroboration. But the
logical structure of the argument from evidential data to proposed conclusion will
differ in ways unrelated to the probative process being invoked. These structures
are important in two respects. First, they are central to questions on how speciﬁc
arguments, or the arguments in a case-as-a-whole, should be evaluated in reach-
ing a judgment. These are questions that Wigmore did not address in any detail.
They have become prominent in the current debate over the nature and role of
probabilistic reasoning in forensic contexts. Second, the structures have consider-
able practical importance for the lawyer who must analyze evidence to identify and
appraise the arguments that can be made in any case. We have largely deferred the
problems associated with evaluation and probabilistic reasoning to chapters 8 and
9 and the appendix on probability.34 But it is important to identify and explain
ﬁve central concepts and their signiﬁcance in analysis before proceeding – conjunc-
tion,compound (andcomplex)propositions,convergence,corroboration,andcatenate
inferences.
a. Conjunction. In order to succeed in a civil or a criminal case, a party may have
to establish each of several facts in issue or merely to establish one of a number of
facts in issue in the alternative. Thus, in a standard murder case, the prosecution
typically has to prove (A) that the victim is dead, (B) that the death was caused

Analysis of Evidence
by an actus reus, (C) that the accused committed the actus reus, and (D) that the
accused acted with criminal intent. Each of these is a necessary element in the
prosecution’s case. On the other hand, it is sufﬁcient for the defense to establish
reasonable doubt by undermining the probability of any of these penultimates or
by offering credible evidence in support of any one of a series of defenses, such
as (E) self-defense, (F) insanity, or (G) provocation. To put the matter formally, to
succeed in a typical murder case, the prosecution has to establish beyond reasonable
doubt that A and B and C and D are true, each of which is a necessary condition,
and it is sufﬁcient for the defense to show either that one of these conditions has not
been established beyond reasonable doubt or that defense E or F or G has not been
negated beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution. In a civil case, the ultimate
probandum may include alternative conditions, disjunctive penultimate probanda,
such that the proponent need only establish one of the alternatives in order to
recover – for example, that the equipment that caused the plaintiff’s injury was
either negligently designed or negligently manufactured.
In every case, a lawyer must ﬁrst determine, at least provisionally, the ultimate
probandum that must be established (or avoided). Thus, counsel for the plaintiff
in Sargent v Southern Accident Company (pages 28–31) would have identiﬁed that
she must ﬁnd evidence sufﬁcient to establish that it was more probable than not
that: (A) Upham Sargent is dead, and (B) he suffered an accidental injury, and
(C) the accidental injury was the sole cause of his death, and (D) he died within
90 days of the accidental injury, and (E) Upham Sargent was the insured under
a $500,000 insurance policy issued by the Southern Accident Company, and (F)
Porter Sargent is the sole beneﬁciary under that policy. Each of the component
propositions is, to some degree, analytically, but not statistically, independent of
theothersandmustbesupported,ataminimum,byevidencesufﬁcienttowithstand
a motion for a directed verdict. Parsing the ultimate probandum into its individual
elements is a necessary ﬁrst step in the analysis that a lawyer must perform in any
case.
b. Compound (or complex) propositions. Sometimes an intermediate probandum
may also contain a number of elements, each of which is supported by separate
evidence. In such instances, the question arises, how should one assess the strength
of the proposition as a whole? Although similar to conjunction, in legal contexts
different considerations apply to assessing the strength of compound propositions
that are intermediate probanda as opposed to assessing the strength of the ultimate
probandum for a case-as-a-whole.
Initially, the analytic task for the lawyer is to identify and to parse such inter-
mediate propositions into their component parts and to reduce each component
to a simple proposition. This task has two aspects. In the abstract, the task must
be performed in order to analyze with precision which evidence bears upon which
component, so that the support for each may be properly appraised. There is also a
strategicaspect.Howthecompoundpropositionandeachofitscomponentsshould
be framed typically is a function of strategy as well as logic. Logic speciﬁes neces-
sary, but rarely sufﬁcient, conditions that must be satisﬁed. For present purposes,

Principles of proof
105
however, it is enough to note that the division of any compound or complex propo-
sition into its simplest constituent parts is necessary to sound analysis.35
The kind of analysis required in dealing with compound intermediate proposi-
tions ordinarily differs from that required to identify and separate the elements in
an ultimate probandum in ways that are signiﬁcant. Once the lawyer has identiﬁed
a potential ultimate probandum in a case, the task of subdividing it into its sepa-
rate elements and reducing them to simple propositions is primarily a task similar
to the task of parsing the holding in an appellate decision. Identifying compound
intermediate propositions that may be necessary or possible steps in an argument
requires more.
The distinction and its importance can be illustrated with the example developed
above (pages 94–98). In that example, the prosecution alleged,
3 It was X who committed the act that caused Y’s death,
and has offered evidence supporting two intermediate propositions:
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.
12 Y died in his home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1 as the result of an unlawful act
committed by another person.
Neither proposition 10 nor 12, standing alone, supports (or is even relevant to)
proposition 3. If they are combined to form the proposition “X was in Y’s house
at 4:30 p.m., and Y died in his home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1 as the result of an
unlawful act committed by another person,” the resulting compound proposition
supports proposition,
13 X had an opportunity to commit the act that caused Y’s death,
which in turn supports proposition 3.
Itisimportantthatlawyersrecognizethepartsofanargumentwheresuchcombi-
nations are necessary because doubts about proposition 10 and about proposition
12 must, in some manner, combine to increase the doubt about proposition 13.
Putting aside questions concerning how such doubts should be combined in reach-
ing a judgment about that proposition, it is clear that the presence of independent
sources of doubt creates possibilities for effective argument that no lawyer should
overlook. This requires careful analysis.36
35 Thedistinctionbetweencompoundandcomplexpropositionsraisesquestionsthatcanbedeferred
until we turn explicitly to problems of evaluation in Chs. 8 and 9. As used here, complex propo-
sitions are compound propositions in which the truth or falsity of each component element is
independent of the truth or falsity of the others.
36 The difﬁculty of the analytic task is enhanced by the fact that the presence of a compound proposi-
tion in argument is often concealed (intentionally or unintentionally) by the language commonly
used in argumentation. The prosecutor, for example, might argue, “The evidence shows that X was
in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m., when the murder occurred.” Counsel for the defense must have foreseen
the likely argument and have identiﬁed that it involves the combination of two simple propositions
in order to plan a response that effectively illustrates the need to consider and combine any doubts
that exist as to each of the component propositions. See also note 38 below (for an illustration of
how the seemingly simple proposition, “Y was murdered in his house at 4:30 p.m.,” might usefully
be divided into three further simple propositions).

106
Analysis of Evidence
Propositions developed through investigations are often complex propositions.
For example, based upon proposition 4 in “An investigation,” the prosecutor can
anticipate that W2 would testify,
28 W2: I saw X, whom I know, running out of Y’s home at 4:45 p.m. on January 1.
This testimonial assertion needs to be broken down into three component propo-
sitions because each is relevant for a different reason.
29 W2: I know X (relevant to credibility of identiﬁcation).
16 W2: I saw X leave Y’s home at 4:45 p.m. on January 1 (relevant to presence in home at
4:45 p.m. and thus to opportunity).
30 W2: X was running when he left Y’s home at 4:45 p.m. on January 1 (relevant to
ﬂight).
The importance of this kind of analysis should be clear.
c. Convergence. A logician provided a useful deﬁnition of convergence: “Two
items of circumstantial evidence converge when both facts, independently of the
other, [support the] probability [of] the same conclusion.”37 For example, consider
two propositions:
9 It was X who entered Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1, and
17 X departed from Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. on January 1.
Either proposition, if accepted as true, would support the inference,
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.
The two converge to strengthen this inference.
Again putting aside questions concerning the degree of additional strength pro-
vided when two propositions converge, it should be clear that convergence raises
analytical issues, in addition to credibility, that are different from those raised by
testimonial corroboration. In the illustration, the lawyer may and should examine
possible explanations unrelated to the credibility of the witnesses – for instance,
32 X may have left Y’s house before 4:30 p.m. to run an errand and returned sometime
after 4:30 p.m. and before 4:45 p.m.
It is also important to note that an argument that is strengthened because two
propositions converge to support a third is an argument that can never be strength-
ened and must ordinarily be weakened because two propositions combine to form
a compound proposition that is a necessary step in the arguments in a case. For
example, if accepted as true, propositions 6 and 16, and the assertions made by W1
and W2, support inferences that converge to strengthen proposition 10, “X was in Y’s
house at 4:30 p.m. on January 1.” That proposition combines with the proposition
12, “Y died in his home at 4:30 p.m. on January 1 as the result of an unlawful act

committedbyanotherperson,”tosupportproposition13,“Xhadanopportunityto
commit the act that caused Y’s death,” which provides a necessary step in the pros-
ecution’s argument that the evidence establishes X’s guilt. The resulting compound
proposition, can, however, be no stronger than its constituent parts and must, in
some sense, be weaker where the evidence leaves ground for doubt about each of
the parts.38
d. Corroboration. The same logician considering the concept in the context of
judicial disputes gave it a narrower meaning that, for present purposes, is useful:
“At its simplest testimonial corroboration occurs when two witnesses both testify,
independently of one another, to the truth of the same proposition.”39 For example,
if a new witness, W6, testiﬁed,
31 W6: I also saw a person with characteristics a, b, c, and d enter Y’s house at 4:15 p.m.
on January 1,
that would corroborate W1’s testimony,
5 “I saw a person with characteristics a, b, c, and d enter Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on
January 1,”
and, in some degree, strengthens the inference,
6 A person with characteristics a, b, c, and d entered Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1.
It is important to recognize the distinction between convergence in general and
corroboration in particular. Corroboration in this narrow sense focuses the analysis
oncredibility.Thelawyerwhowishestochallengeaproponent’sassertionsupported
by the independent testimony of two witnesses must begin by examining possible
sources of error that may diminish the credibility of either or both witnesses – such
as that the conditions under which the observation took place were not suitable for
accurate perception (lighting, distance, eyesight, etc.); the witness’s memory is not
reliable (lapse of time, reliability of the witness with respect to other events, etc.);
or the witness has a motive to lie (animosity toward X, fear of prosecution, etc.).
By limiting corroboration to this narrower meaning, the starting-point for analysis
is clariﬁed. That limitation also makes it possible to maintain an analytically useful
distinction between corroboration and convergence.
e. Catenate inferences. Catenate inferences are “chains” of inferences, a condition
that exists when there is more than one step in the reasoning necessary to show
38 In theory, the strength of a compound proposition can never be greater than the strength of the
weakest of its constituent parts. If I am absolutely certain that Y was murdered in his house at
4:30 p.m., but I think it only slightly more probable than not that X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m.,
I can at most conclude that the compound proposition is slightly more probable than not. If I
also have doubt about (i) whether Y was, in fact, murdered, or (ii) whether his death occurred
in the house, or (iii) whether the time of death was 4:30 p.m., my doubts must in some manner
combine to diminish the degree of certainty with which I could accept the compound proposition
as proven. We address problems of this kind in Chs. 8 and 9 and the appendix on probability.

Analysis of Evidence
the relationship by which a probans supports a probandum. An argument from an
autoptic proference to a fact of consequence almost invariably involves (and can
always be restated to involve) catenate rather than simple inferences. For example,
the ﬁrst step in any inferential chain from a testimonial assertion must always be
the truth of the matter asserted – e.g., from the fact that W2 testiﬁed,
16 W2: I saw X leave Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. on January 1,
we infer that,
17 X departed from Y’s house at 4:45 p.m. on January 1,
and then infer that,
10 X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m on January 1.
Two points follow from this that should be noted. First, sound analysis requires
that the lawyer identify and articulate each step in the chain of inferences necessary
to reason from an autoptic proference to a fact of consequence. The step omitted
is the possible source of doubt not identiﬁed, the “weak link” unseen, the possible
point of attack unnoted. Second, creativity and judgment are required in analyzing
and articulating the steps in an inferential chain. The best practical guide in this
context is that the lawyer should seek to identify every condition that may give
reason for doubt about the claim that probans A supports probandum B. Each
ground that raises a plausible basis for doubt indicates that there is a necessary step
in the inferential chain that should be examined.
f. Combining Evidentiary Propositions: Integration. Most factual arguments
involve the use of different logical structures – inferences that are corroborative,
convergent, or catenate, or the product of a combination of two (or more) simple
propositions – in demonstrating the proposed relationships between discrete evi-
dential data and the probandum urged. As a practical matter it is important to be
able to recognize the distinctions and their signiﬁcance.
The simple inference from each testimonial assertion to the truth of the fact
asserted focuses attention on credibility as the most signiﬁcant source of possible
doubt. The presence of two or more testimonial assertions that are corroborative
may diminish the likelihood that credibility can be plausibly attacked (perhaps to
a point where further explorations are not justiﬁed), but it cannot eliminate it.
Where two circumstantial propositions converge to strengthen a third, the lawyer
must consider possible explanations unrelated to credibility and possible sources of
evidence that might support one of these explanations or support a rival inference.
Where two propositions combine to support a further inference, the lawyer must
recognize that the support cannot be stronger than the weaker of the two and must
look for further possibilities that may explain or rival the proposed probandum –
for instance, that X was present in the house at the time of the murder, but a
third party intruder, acting independently, was the person who committed the act
that caused Y’s death. She should focus her investigations accordingly. The fact

109
that multiple steps are required in an argument from evidential data to proposed
conclusion signals the need for further investigation before the case is tried and
makes it possible to identify and eliminate or cumulate sources of doubt that can
be used in argument at trial.
Those distinctions make it possible to frame more clearly some issues of con-
siderable importance – namely, questions about how doubt at each stage of an
argument should be considered in reaching a judgment whether a probandum has
been proven to the required degree of certainty. If there is any ground to doubt
credibility of W1 (proposition 5) or W6 (proposition 31) or their ability to identify
accurately the characteristics of the person they say they saw enter Y’s house at
4:15 p.m. in the circumstances present, there must be some ground to doubt the
inferences they support, that a person who had the same characteristics as X entered
at 4:15 p.m. Assuming there is some doubt, how should these doubts and the addi-
tional doubt created by limiting qualiﬁcations on the generalization, proposition
11, “People who enter a house usually remain for more than ﬁfteen minutes,” affect
the assessment of the likelihood that proposition 10, “X was in Y’s house at 4:30
p.m.,” is true? How then should those doubts be combined with any doubts about
the time, place, or cause of Y’s death in evaluating the strength of the inference that
Y had an opportunity to commit the act that caused Y’s death and how can they be
accumulated in reaching a judgment about the penultimate probandum, “It was X
who murdered Y”?
These are important questions. They have been the subject of extensive (and
sometimes heated) debate among scholars holding different theories of probability.
They are obviously signiﬁcant to a lawyer in a criminal case who must argue to a
jury that ultimate probandum in that case has or has not been proved “beyond a
reasonable doubt.” Those questions are addressed in Chapters 8 and 9.
The chart and other methods of analysis presented in this book do not address
these questions. The principles of proof developed in this chapter and the chart
method of analysis presented in the next chapter can be used and applied to any
case because they are independent of any of the contending theories of probability.
With a few adjustments, probability theorists from any of the schools may use
the principles and the method to analyze and organize the evidence in a case in a
manner that facilitates the development of their ideas on how the particular parts
and the whole should be evaluated. As a practical matter, the principles and the
methods Wigmore presented, as reﬁned and developed here, can readily be adapted
to facilitate the analysis, construction, and appraisal of arguments about disputed
questions of fact that are the concern of the analyst.

Analysis of Evidence
In response to the housekeeper’s call, I was dispatched to Vern’s home at 8:15, Monday
morning. The housekeeper said she had arrived at 8:00 a.m. and discovered Vern’s
body lying on the living room ﬂoor. The living room was a shambles. Upon examining
the body, I found a scrap of brown Harris tweed cloth clutched in Vern’s right hand.
(I extracted the scrap of cloth, placed it in an evidence bag, marked and sealed the bag,
and subsequently delivered it to the police evidence custodian.)
. . . After learning that Vern had been wealthy and that his sole surviving heir was
a nephew named Archer, I proceeded to Archer’s house to interview him. I arrived at
5:30 p.m., Wednesday. Archer stated he had been at home and had gone to bed early
on Sunday and had gone directly to work Monday morning.
. . . As I was departing, I observed a brown Harris tweed jacket in Archer’s front
closet. It had a hole in the upper right hand sleeve.
. . . At 7:30 a.m., Thursday, I returned with a warrant to search Archer’s home.
I seized the jacket, placed it in an evidence bag, and sealed and marked the bag. A visual
comparison of the scrap of cloth found in Vern’s hand and the jacket shows that the
scrap and the jacket are the same color, texture, and weave. The scrap ﬁts in the hole in
the upper right sleeve of the jacket . . .
On the strength of this and other evidence, Archer has been arrested and indicted
for the murder of Vern. You are now preparing for trial and planning what further
investigations should be done. Your current provisional ultimate probandum is:
“It was Archer who murdered Vern.” For today, you are only concerned with the
relationship between the propositions supported by the scrap of cloth, the jacket,
and Paul’s anticipated testimony with respect to these two items.
1 Create and number a keylist of simple propositions which you could elicit as
testimonial assertions from Detective Paul and the circumstantial propositions you
would argue that the trier of fact should infer directly from these testimonial
assertions and the scrap of cloth and the jacket and label. Each proposition should be
phrased as a simple declarative statement to which the trier of fact might assign a
truth value (for instance, true or false, probable or not probable). Each proposition
representing a testimonial assertion or a physical object must be an autoptic
proference the jury will hear or see.
2 Given the ultimate probandum, “It was Archer who murdered Vern,” identify each
intermediate proposition the trier of fact must infer in order to conclude that the
evidential propositions you have listed support the conclusion that the ultimate
probandum is true.
3 Abduction: We are concerned here only with the scrap of cloth, the jacket, and the
circumstances in which each was discovered. In light of these facts and the analysis
you have developed, what additional evidential data might be available to strengthen
or weaken the inference that P is true? State precisely the plausible hypotheses that
should be investigated and speciﬁc evidence you would direct Paul to seek to support
(or eliminate) each.
4 Defense Counsel’s Preliminary Standpoint. You have been appointed to represent
Archer. You have not met him. The prosecution has given you Paul’s reports. You

have, of course, performed the same analysis as the prosecutor in order to evaluate the
case and to determine what information you will seek from Archer and what other
investigations you will make. Formulate a list of propositions that might explain away
the prosecutor’s proposed inferences. Do the facts as reported by Paul suggest any
possible propositions for which there might be evidential support and which would
involve the rival or denial processes? List the potential propositions. Classify each
proposition on your list as opponent’s explanation (OE), denial (OD), or rival (OR).

Methods of analysis
A. Introduction
The principles of inductive logic are the common tools of practical reasoning and
are important to anyone who must make decisions based upon incomplete and
fallible data. These tools are specially important in many professions. Society holds
professionals to a higher standard of reasoning because, ordinarily, their decisions
can signiﬁcantly affect the interests of individuals or society as a whole, and they
are supposed to be competent to make such decisions. In one view, the highest
standards may reasonably be required of doctors and lawyers. They undertake to
solve problems of great importance for individuals, and their work in the aggregate
is critical to society.
Every profession that engages in fact analysis and reasoning must develop
ways of recording and organizing the data in forms suitable for analysis and use.
This is surely true for lawyers. At every stage, the lawyer must engage in analysis.
Has my client provided me with sufﬁcient facts to state a claim for relief or a basis
for a defense? What additional evidence should I seek to test and strengthen my
client’s case? Given the evidence available to both sides, can the data be marshaled
to persuade the relevant decision-maker that my client is entitled to satisfactory
relief?
Analysis must ordinarily precede use, and a system designed to record and orga-
nize data in a manner that facilitates analysis will ordinarily differ signiﬁcantly from
a system designed to facilitate the effective, post-analysis use of that data. The lawyer
then needs a system under which the data can be organized and marshaled for pre-
sentation in the appropriate context, be it counseling, negotiation, or trial. Here,
the nature of the forum in which the evidence and arguments will be presented
dictates the requirements for a system to order and organize the available data for
its intended use.
Lawyers have developed a variety of systems for recording and organizing data.
The ﬁling system in a lawyer’s ofﬁce is designed to ensure information received on
each matter and the products of any analysis or research are organized to facilitate
retrieval for use. Chronologies have long been recognized as a useful device for
organizing factual information for analysis. Over the past two decades, lawyers

113
(and other professionals) have developed sophisticated record management and
indexing systems to facilitate analysis, often augmented by computerized support
systems.1 So too, they have developed devices such as the trial book to organize the
data for effective presentation to a tribunal in light of the analysis done. There has,
however, been far less attention devoted to articulating the principles and protocols
that should be applied in analyzing factual data in legal (and other) contexts in
order to enhance the quality and the completeness of the analysis.
In this chapter, we present a generalized set of procedures, a protocol, that we
think may usefully be applied in any method of analysis. In Chapter 5, we present
a simpliﬁed version of Wigmore’s chart method of analysis and show how the
protocol can be adapted and applied to use that method. In Chapter 6, we describe
the outline method of analysis and the uses of narrative and chronologies as analytic
devices. In that chapter, we also describe how and when the different methods and
devices can be used in the context of a case to be litigated and tried.
B. The methods and a protocol for their use
1. Methods of analysis and analytic devices
In this book we present two methods of analysis – the “chart method” and the
“outline method.” A “method of analysis” in this context is a method for record-
ing and organizing data and for specifying the logical relationships among the
propositions and how they can be marshaled to support or negate a fact of conse-
quence. Each method of analysis results in a distinct product. The distinctive feature
of the chart method is that the principal products are a key-list and a chart. The
“key-list” contains all of the evidential and inferential propositions that can be mar-
shaled to support or undermine the ultimate proposition to be proved, the ultimate
probandum. The “chart” uses symbols to depict the claimed logical relationships
between these propositions. (See page 139 below for an illustration.) The product
of the outline method of analysis is an outline that simpliﬁes the complex propo-
sition that is the ultimate probandum into simple propositions, the penultimate
probanda, and uses them as the major headings in the outline. The major headings
are then divided and subdivided into necessary intermediate propositions until the
analyst reaches the evidential propositions – the propositions that express what the
decision-maker will hear or see, if and when the case is tried.

2 Wigmore thought that narratives constituted a separate “method of analysis” (Science, 821). For
reasons described below, we maintain that narrative complements analysis but is not an alternative
to analysis. Although narrative serves many purposes, we characterize it here as an analytic device
to emphasize its role in the analytic process and reduce the temptation for the analyst to “skip” the
more rigorous and demanding methods of analysis in favor of just constructing stories.

Analysis of Evidence
completeness of an analysis. Converting all of the available data into propositions
ordered in a strict chronology, at any stage, simpliﬁes the task of discovering story
possibilities that can be constructed from the available evidence. It simpliﬁes the
task of discovering gaps that need to be ﬁlled. Narratives serve similar functions.
For example, when an analysis of the available evidence has been completed shortly
before trial, the question becomes: Can the analysis be converted into a coherent
narrative that is consistent with the theory of the case and that accounts for the
available evidence, but that does not depend upon facts for which there is no
evidence? In contrast, when the analysis has been done at the investigative stage,
the question may be: Does a narrative derived from that analysis reveal gaps that
need to be ﬁlled or suggest additional lines of inquiry that need to be pursued?
Constructing chronologies and plausible narratives that might be true at that stage
can facilitate imaginative reasoning of the kind described in Chapter 2.
The methods of analysis are complementary rather than rival. Each has special
advantagesforspeciﬁcpurposesatvariousstagesofacase.Foreach,thequalityofthe

its construction and use. We believe that every lawyer should be familiar with both
methods, with the purposes for which each is best suited, and with the procedures,
the protocol, by which each may be used to maximize its advantages, as well as with
the ways in which the analytic devices can be used to facilitate and enhance the
resulting product.
2. A seven-step protocol for analysis: a generalized account
In the context of a legal dispute, three questions must always be addressed:
1 What is the ultimate proposition that must be proved?
2 What are the data that are available?
3 What are the plausible and defensible relationships between these data and the
ultimate proposition?
A method of analyzing evidence is basically a heuristic device for responding to
these questions. As such, the device should have two components – (i) a practicable
method for organizing and conducting the analysis and (ii) a system for recording
or expressing the results of the analysis in a usable form.
Experience suggests that the quality of an analysis and the resulting product are
enhanced if those engaged in the task observe a known and systematic protocol. We
believe the quality of the analysis of evidence in a legal dispute and the product that
results from that analysis are likely to be enhanced if a systematic set of procedures
is regularly employed. The protocol we have developed has seven steps:
1 Clariﬁcation of standpoint;
2 Formulation of the potential ultimate probandum or probanda;
3 Formulation of the potential penultimate probanda;
4 Formulation of the theories of the case;

5 Recording the available data;
6 Preparing the product(s); and
7 Reﬁning and completing the analysis.
Step 1. Clarify the standpoint of the analyst by giving clear and precise answers to
four questions: Who am I? At what stage in what process am I? What materials are
available for analysis? What am I trying to do?
Standpoint is always a function of four dependent variables – time, objective (or
purpose), materials available for analysis, and role. In academic law instruction,
the point in time is typically post-trial and post-appeal. For the practitioner and,
with appropriate exercises, for the student, the exercise may focus upon any stage:
reviewing a trial record for appeal, developing a closing argument based upon
evidence given, preparing a matter for trial based upon a completed investigation,
investigatingamatterinpreparationforlitigationortrial,evaluatingaclient’sclaims
in order to aid the decision whether to litigate, or even advising a client on proposed
conduct or on how to structure proposed conduct with respect to the prospect of
future litigation.
The standpoint is also a function of the objectives of the analysis. These can
usefully be divided into three main classes: organizational, evaluative, and advocacy
objectives. One of the main values of a rigorous method of analysis is as a tool
for organizing or ordering or structuring the evidence and the inferences derived
from it, as a preliminary to pursuing some other objective, such as evaluating
the “net persuasive effect” of the evidence or converting the analysis into a form
suitable for the presentation of an argument in a forum, e.g., in a negotiation or at
a trial.
For Wigmore, and for most academic analyses, the objective is ordinarily to
evaluate the evidence offered or reported to determine whether a case was rightly
or justiﬁably decided with reference to some articulated standard – for instance,
given the substantive law and the burden of proof the court found applicable,
did the evidence support the factual conclusion necessary to sustain the result
reached? This evaluative analysis may be done for different purposes – to determine
whether the lawyer could have done better on closing argument or on appeal,
whether the rules of admissibility operated to further or frustrate an inquiry to
determine truth, etc. But all such exercises start from the assumption that the
evidence presented to the trier of fact or the facts reported by the appellate court
are ﬁxed.
For example, the O. J. Simpson case is history. If we were to take the standpoint of
a historian examining the trial record, we would need to differentiate the question,
“Was the verdict justiﬁed?” from the question, “What actually happened?” It is one
thingtoask,“WasthejuryjustiﬁedinacquittingSimpsononthebasisoftheevidence
and arguments presented at trial?” It is another to ask, “Could the prosecution have
presented a stronger case at the trial than they in fact did?” And still another to ask,
“On the basis of all the evidence available today, can it now be established that it

Analysis of Evidence
is beyond reasonable doubt that O. J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of Nicole
Brown Simpson?”
An advocacy objective is typically dominant when the student or the lawyer
seeks to perform the analysis to assist in determining an appropriate course of
conduct. What additional investigation or discovery should I seek to strengthen (or
weaken) inferences necessary to the development of my client’s (or my adversary’s)
case? What evidence must I highlight, and what evidence must I seek to exclude or
minimize to develop my theory of the case?3
The objectives that can be achieved are limited by the materials available for
analysis. If the available material is a report of a decision by a court of appeal, the
analyst can only determine whether the decision was supported by the facts that
the court chose to report. She cannot determine whether the evidence presented
at trial was sufﬁcient to support a determination that the accused was guilty. She
cannot determine whether the court fairly summarized the evidence. If the material
is the trial record from a decided case, the analyst might examine the competency
of counsel in structuring and marshaling the evidence and arguments. She might
be able to make a judgment about whether the evidence was sufﬁcient to enable
the fact-ﬁnder (judge or jury) to determine that the ultimate probandum was or
was not proven to the required degree of certainty. She could not, however, deter-
mine whether the accused was guilty or innocent because she does not have access
to the evidence that was not discovered or presented. The failure to identify an
objective that can be achieved based upon the materials available is a common
error that can have serious consequences. Midway in a project, the analyst may
discover that the objective speciﬁed cannot be achieved with the data available.
Either the objective must be amended (often not possible) or the job must be
redone.
A fourth variable is role. Role is always implicit once the objective is chosen. But
it may be useful to consider the variable separately both to clarify objectives and
to reveal possible personal biases of the person doing the analysis. For example,
the lawyer preparing for trial must examine the evidence from three standpoints
and three roles in order to do the job completely: ﬁrst, the role of advocate for her
client; second, the standpoint and role of her opponent; and, ﬁnally, the role and
standpoint of the trier of fact. What is her opponent likely to adopt as his theory of
the case? To what extent will the triers of fact share the generalizations (or biases)
upon which the probative force of her analysis and marshaling of the evidence
depend?
It is always important to deﬁne standpoint carefully from the outset and at each
stage of the case. For present purposes, let us assume the role is that of a lawyer
engaged to represent a client with respect to a contested matter, the outcome of
which appears likely to depend upon the resolution of disputed questions of fact
3 The concept of a “theory of the case” and related concepts are further developed below at page 118.

(as opposed to a dispute over the controlling legal principles). Throughout, the
lawyer’s purpose will be to aid the client in determining and achieving the best
possible outcome. Under this assumption, standpoint will vary according to the
stage at which an analysis of the state of the evidence is undertaken.
The objective of the analysis, and the tools available and useful, will also differ
at different stages of a case. For example, at a ﬁrst interview the lawyer will be
listeningandprobingforfactsthatwillmakeitpossibletoframeprovisionalultimate
probanda as hypotheses. At that stage, these hypotheses will be tested by questions
framed to determine whether there appears to be evidence available that would
support each of the necessary elements of the hypotheses.
Step 2. Formulate carefully and precisely the potential ultimate probandum or
probanda. This does not come as naturally to students as an experienced lawyer
might expect. It is surprising how often students fail to see that this is a crucial
preliminary step that provides the focal point for the whole analysis. Without an
ultimateprobandumthereisnotouchstoneofrelevance;ifitisincorrectlyorloosely
formulated, the ensuing analysis is correspondingly vulnerable.
The ﬁrst step then must be to formulate (or identify) the controlling propositions
of law. The substantive propositions constitute the major premises; the ultimate
probandum or probanda are the minor premises – those propositions of fact which,
if found proven to the required degree, compel or support the conclusion that the
party with the burden must prevail. Two caveats are important. First, the ultimate
probandum should ordinarily be phrased in a way that respects the burden of proof.
The lawyers for O. J. Simpson did not have to prove that he was not guilty; it was the
prosecution’s burden to prove that he was. Second, the ultimate probandum should
not include the standard of proof. The probative force of the evidence cannot be
charted. The propositions deﬁning the burden of proof come into play after the
analysis has been completed and the task shifts to an evaluation of the probative
force of the evidence.4
In the O. J. Simpson case,5 the ultimate probandum had to be derived from the
rule of law deﬁning ﬁrst degree murder. Under Section 187(a) of the California
Penal Code, “Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being . . . with malice
aforethought.” That section might be rephrased as the major premise of a syllogism:
4 It should be clear that analysis and evaluation cannot be completely compartmentalized in practice.
As the analyst constructs an argument, she automatically appraises its strength. It is, however, useful
to maintain the distinction in applying the protocols for analysis. See Chs. 8 and 9 below.

Analysis of Evidence
If a human being, a victim, is dead, and the victim died as a result of an unlawful act, and
it was the accused who committed the act that caused the victim’s death, and the person
who committed the act that caused the victim’s death acted with malice aforethought,
then the accused is guilty of murder.
For the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson (“NBS”), the ultimate probandum
had to be a proposition that satisﬁed the conditions of that major premise. That
proposition might be framed in the abstract as:
NBS is dead; and NBS died as the result of an unlawful act; and it was Orenthal James
Simpson (“OJS”) who committed the act that caused NBS’s death; and the person who
committed the acts that caused NBS’s death acted with malice aforethought.
Step 3. Formulate the potential penultimate probanda. Ordinarily the ultimate
probandum or probanda are complex propositions with more than one condi-
tion that must be satisﬁed. Determining the penultimate probanda, initially and at
a minimum, requires that the analysts convert the complex ultimate probandum
into a compound proposition and partition (and often sub-partition) that propo-
sition into its component simple propositions. Once these penultimate probanda
have been tentatively formulated, the lawyer should be in a position to visualize the
overall structure of the case.

caused NBS’s death.6 In that case, a central problem for the prosecution was to
develop a credible theory that would explain why OJS would have committed the

theory. Theoretically, defense counsel could have disputed proposition 4 (intent) by claiming the
person who murdered NBS acted in the heat of passion. As a practical matter, the theory that the
defense adopted forced them to take the position that proposition 4 was irrelevant to the defense.
The defense denied that it was OJS who did the stabbing and offered evidence suggesting that there
were others who might have done it. Having committed themselves to a reasonable-doubt-about-
proposition 3 theory, they could not credibly argue that it was not OJS, but if it was OJS he was
acting in the heat of passion. A trial lawyer may develop alternative theories, but she may not present
conﬂicting theories, at least not in a jury trial.

murders – to identify a credible motive.7 The prosecution elected to proceed on a
theory of control, a theory that might be summarized as follows:
OJS had expressed jealous rage resulting in violence in his attempts to control
NBS and prevent her from ﬁnally severing their relationship. His continuing
jealous rage gave him a motive to murder her as the ultimate act of control, and
the brutal manner in which she was murdered by multiple stab wounds shows
that she was murdered by someone acting in a rage. OJS was the only person who
had acted against NBS in a jealous rage. He had a motive to try to maintain his
control and to prevent NBS from acting independently, and he went to her house
to kill her as the ultimate act of control. Therefore, it was OJS who murdered
NBS in a jealous rage.8
Partitioning the ultimate probandum into simple declarative sentences that con-
stitute the penultimate probanda identiﬁes the principal “facts of consequence” in
the case.9 The speciﬁcation of a provisional theory of the case makes it possible
to use a penultimate probandum as a “magnet” to attract the relevant evidential
propositions.
For example, in order to prove that “it was OJS who committed the acts that
caused NBS’s death,” the prosecution had to prove that OJS had an opportunity to
commit the acts. Thus, the analyst might look for evidential propositions bearing
upon the time of NBS’s death and the time OJS was subsequently observed because
they would be relevant to the proposition, “OJS had an opportunity to commit the
violent acts that caused NBS’s death.”
A post-trial analyst might use the “opportunity magnet” to examine the
database – the evidence admitted during the trial. Using that magnet, her key-
list would include relevant evidential propositions derived directly from the data.
For example, Pablo Fuentes, who lived near NBS’s house, testiﬁed that he had heard
the plaintive wail of a dog at 10:15 p.m. on the evening the murder was committed.
Other witnesses testiﬁed that they later had found NBS’s dog wailing and with blood
on its paws. From these propositions, the jury might have inferred the propositions
necessary to demonstrate the logical relationship of those evidential propositions
7 Theprosecutiondoesnothavetoprovemotiveinacriminalcase;itisnotapenultimateprobandum.
Motive, if it exists, is relevant to show it was the accused who committed the act that caused the
victim’s death. It may also be relevant to intent. In Simpson and in many cases, however, it is
difﬁcult, sometimes impossible, to persuade a jury to convict without providing a persuasive reason
explaining why the accused did it.
8 See Schmalleger (1996) 57–59 (excerpt from “The Prosecution’s Opening Statement”). There were
alternate theories that the prosecution might have chosen. For example, the prosecution team
reportedly considered, but rejected, an “exploding bomb” theory: OJS went to NBS’s house that
evening intending to vent his anger by committing an act of vandalism, such as slashing the tires
on her car. His anger “exploded” when he found NBS with another man, Ronald Goldman (RLG),
in the yard in front of her house.
9 Once a witness has taken the stand, her credibility also becomes a fact of consequence. It should be
clear that all of the evidential data offered at trial must be relevant to either one or more penultimate
probandaortothecredibilityofawitness.SeeChapter2onrelevance(pages62–63)andtestimonial

Analysis of Evidence
to a penultimate probandum – e.g., the plaintive wail of the dog that belonged to
NBS and had blood on its paws supported an inference that the wailing was caused
by the dog’s discovery that its mistress was dead, supporting the further inference
that the murder occurred at or shortly after 10:15 p.m. Detective Vanetter testiﬁed
that it took ﬁve minutes to drive from NBS’s house to OJS’s house. Alan Park, a
chauffeur who was waiting for OJS, testiﬁed that a recently showered and calm and
collected OJS emerged from his house at 11:00 p.m. to be driven to the airport. This
testimony and the evidence supporting an inference that NBS died at 10:15 p.m.
provided the basis upon which the prosecution had to persuade the jury that OJS
had an opportunity to commit the murders – i.e. that he could have been present
at NBS’s house at 10:15 p.m. and still have returned home, showered, disposed of
his bloody garments, collected himself, and emerged from his house at 11:00 p.m.
In other instances, it may be easier to start with an evidential proposition and
reason “upward” to develop the inferred propositions that clarify its relevance. In
the previous example, an analyst might initially ask why the testimony about a dog’s
wailingat10:15p.m.wasrelevant,andworkupwarduntilshesawthatitwasrelevant
to establishing the time of NBS’s death and that establishing the time of NBS’s death
was necessary to determine whether OJS could have had an opportunity to kill
NBS. Often, the need to reason upward occurs when pieces of the puzzle are “left
over” – i.e. evidential data that seem relevant remain unused after the penultimate
“magnets” have been applied to the entire mass of available evidential data. The
process of ﬁtting these leftover pieces into the puzzle often forces revisions of the
theory and penultimate probanda.
Until the ﬁnal analysis is complete, the theories must remain provisional, subject
to revision as the analysis proceeds. If the problem is a complex one involving a mass
of evidence, it is highly likely that there will be a range of possible theories each of
which could lead the analysis in signiﬁcantly different directions. In order to make
the task manageable, it may be necessary to eliminate some possibilities and con-
centrate on one or more speciﬁc theories. Even historians and scientists do not have
inﬁnite time and resources to pursue endless lines of inquiry. Typically advocates
have to develop a provisional theory that will guide their analysis at an early stage.
Until the analysis is complete, they must remember that the theory is provisional
and remains open to being revised or even changed as the analysis proceeds.
The task of the lawyer is simpler than that of other analysts, such as the historian
or the intelligence analyst. The lawyer has an opponent who will try to organize and
marshal the evidence to prevent her adversary from prevailing. The lawyer can often
limit the number of potential theories that should be examined by formulating the
strongest potential theory or theories of the case for her opponent. The theories
that need to be examined are those that, given the available evidence, hold the most
promise in light of the plausible theories that her opponent may use.10
10 In Chs. 6 and 10 we shall explore in some detail the nature of such theories, their relationship to
“story,” “situation,” and “theme” in the context of advocacy, and their functions at different stages
of litigation.

Step 5. Recording the available data. The evidential data must be recorded in
propositional form. The dynamic nature of the development of a case over time
makes it necessary that the lawyer have some adaptable generic devices that can
be employed to record the data in an organized form and that can be expanded as
the case develops. One common device of this kind is the chronology. Chronolo-
gies can be developed in two forms. One form is a chronology based upon the
individual witnesses, documents, or other items of evidence. For each potential
witness and exhibit place the events that can be asserted or shown in chrono-
logical order. The other form is a master chronology, which places each of the
propositions supported by the data in a temporal sequence, indexed to the wit-
nesses or documents by which they are to be established. So ordered, these propo-
sitions describe the events that are known or believed to have occurred in the
precise sequence in which they occurred. Such a chronology sets the events and
documents in the order in which they occurred, the order in which most people
think.
As an analytic device, the chronology serves two functions. It helps the lawyer see
where there are temporal gaps that need to be ﬁlled or explained. Moreover, it helps
thelawyerseenarratives,“storypossibilities,”thatmightexplaintheeventstakenasa
whole. Both devices enable the lawyer to identify areas where further investigation is
necessary and should be productive. Because the chronology is ordered temporally,
it can be revised and expanded as new evidential data are obtained.11 In most cases,
a lawyer should begin to develop a master chronology rather early. Later in the case,
a fully developed chronology may provide the framework for presenting the theory
of the case as a story in the opening statement.
Throughout all stages of the process, steps 1 through 5 are reﬂexive. The analyst
needs to have a provisional ultimate probandum to identify possible theories and
to establish some basis for selecting lines of investigation that are likely to produce
relevant evidential data. At the outset, however, the lawyer needs some factual asser-
tions (ordinarily the client’s statements) in order to identify potentially applicable
principles of law that will enable her to frame ultimate and penultimate probanda
as provisional hypotheses. The hypotheses so framed and the provisional theory
adopted will guide further investigation, and that investigation, in turn, is likely to
generate data that will require that the probanda and the theory be revised or that
new or additional ones be provisionally adopted.
Two points merit emphasis. First, in processes such as interviewing and investi-
gation, these four steps are likely to be useful in differing sequences. Second, at any
stage where the lawyer undertakes a comprehensive analysis to determine the state
of the case at that time, each step will be required even though the probanda are
provisional and the data incomplete.
11 Some cases require alternative or additional generic devices. For example, if the location at which
the events occurred is critical, physical diagrams or models may be important analytic devices.
So too, in a products liability case, engineering models and blueprints may be necessary. In other
complex cases, devices from other ﬁelds may be useful – for example, economic analysis in an
antitrust case or statistical analysis in an employment discrimination case.

Analysis of Evidence
Step 6. Preparing the product(s). The product produced is a function of the method
chosen – a key-list and chart in the chart method or an outline for the outline
method. These methods and analytic devices overlap in ways that make it possible
to convert material generated by an analytical device into the product of one of
the methods of analysis and to transfer material recorded for one method into the
product of the other. For example, the propositions in a master chronology are
propositions that will appear in an outline and propositions from the chronology
and the outline will appear in a key-list and chart.
Step 7. Reﬁning and completing the analysis. Whatever the product, the objective is
to develop a logically sound analysis that, in light of the analyst’s speciﬁc objectives,
organizes a mass of evidence and identiﬁes the inferences necessary to relate all
signiﬁcant relevant data to the ultimate proposition in issue. Typically, the process
of revision and reﬁnement is continuous, with judgments previously made being
revised in each succeeding step of the analysis to deal with any gaps discovered or
ﬂaws in the reasoning that are revealed as the process proceeds. It is, however, the
chart and key-list, or the outline completed through step 6, that makes it possible to
analyze and evaluate the case-as-a-whole and to test the judgments initially made.
This is where the true value of the analysis as both intellectual exercise and practical
work emerges most clearly. For that reason, the ﬁnal analysis of the whole should
be done as a separate step.
Exercise
Read and review the O. J. Simpson problem in Chapter 1. Prepare a list of the
propositions concerning opportunity in chronological order. Develop an opportu-
nity theory that would support the prosecution’s claim that the evidence showed
beyond reasonable doubt that OJS could have murdered NBS and RLG. Develop a
defense theory that would support the defense’s claim that it cannot be established
beyond reasonable doubt that OJS could have murdered NBS and RLG. Both the
prosecution and the defense theories must account for the three thumps that Kato
Kaelin testiﬁed he had heard around 10:45 p.m. and the black man in dark clothes
that Alan Parks testiﬁed he had seen approaching the house at 10:55 p.m.

The chart method
A. The chart method: an overview
The chart method of analysis is the most rigorous of the three methods of analysis
identiﬁed above. It is a technique that enables the analyst to construct, test, and
reconstruct arguments about questions of fact. It requires that the analyst articulate
every step in an argument, breaking down the argument into simple propositions,
and then mapping or “charting” all the relations between those propositions and the
penultimate probanda (or the components of a hypothesis). The logic is simple; the
complexity lies in the materials to be analyzed and in identifying the relationships
between the propositions in an extensive argument based on a mass of conﬂicting
evidence. The logic is binary: Every relevant proposition either tends to support or
tends to negate a single hypothesis or conclusion (the ultimate probandum). The
technique is dialectical: The aim of the chart-maker should be to construct the most
cogent possible argument for and against the ultimate conclusion and to relate the
opposing arguments within a single coherent structure.
The chart method structures the analysis at two levels – the macroscopic level
and the microscopic level. The macroscopic level involves structuring the “top” of
the chart. The ultimate and penultimate probanda must be determined based upon
the law and, usually, restated after the analyst has formulated a provisional theory
of the case. The penultimate probanda help the analyst identify which of the main
propositions must be established to support each of the penultimate probanda.
Ordinarily, there are subordinate probanda that can be immediately identiﬁed.
For example, in a murder case the central question often is, “Was it the accused
who committed the act that caused the victim’s death?” In such a case, the analyst
must recognize that any evidence that supports an inference that the accused had
opportunity or motive may be important. The subordinate propositions become
metaphorical magnets the analyst can use in sorting the evidence and organizing
different phases of the argument into discrete, manageable sectors. The key lies in
anchoring the arguments about the case as a whole in a deﬁned standpoint, clear
questions, and precisely formulated hypotheses or conclusions.
The microscopic level requires precise and detailed analysis of the evidential
data for each important phase of the argument. This “microscopic analysis” is

Analysis of Evidence
arduousandtime-consumingwork.However,withpractice,theanalystlearnssome
basic principles of economy, by identifying crucial or important phases within an
argument and focusing mainly on these. If a person’s jugular vein is severed, death
is almost inevitable. In advocacy “going for the jugular” means concentrating one’s
attack on the weakest point in an opponent’s argument or, more positively, building
up support for a proposition which, if established, will ensure success. The chart
method of analysis is particularly useful for identifying potentially key propositions
that can be used to build or destroy a case.
The two main products that distinguish the chart method from other methods of
analysis are a “key-list” of all the propositions used in the argument and a detailed
map showing how propositions inferred from the evidential data can be logically
marshaled to provide the strongest arguments in support of and against the ultimate
probandum. The method is disciplined and systematic, but a chart is a picture of
the chart-maker’s beliefs about what constitutes the strongest argument. Judgment,
selection, skill, and analytical capacity are required at every stage. The chart method
is an aid to disciplined analysis, construction, and criticism of arguments; it should
not be viewed as a substitute for thinking.
B. The seven-step protocol for the chart method:
a detailed account
Mastering Wigmore’s chart method of analysis is similar to mastering any complex
analytical skill. In learning it, you should try to cultivate the habit of going through
a regular sequence of operations step-by-step. Steps 1 through 4 and 7 are common
to all methods; steps 5 and 6 must be adapted to the chart method. To provide a
solid foundation, we present a more detailed account of each of the steps, adapted
to the chart method, using the United States v. Able case from Chapter 1 (page 23).
Step1.Clarifying standpoint. The analyst must answer the four basic questions at the
outset of any analysis project: Who am I? At what stage in what process am I? What
materials are available for analysis? What am I trying to do? The consequences of
failing to respond carefully to each of these questions can be dramatic and traumatic
inapplyingthechartmethod.Atsomepointintryingtodevelopthechartedanalysis,
usually after the investment of substantial time and effort, the deﬁciency is more
likely to become apparent because the precision required for the chart method
makes it far more difﬁcult to overlook any deﬁciencies.
For purposes of learning how to apply the chart method, it is often helpful to
adopt the standpoint of a historian making an ex post facto judgment about what
happened (the event) on the basis of a ﬁnite body of evidence. In this context, a
historian might deﬁne and pursue a single objective – the construction and eval-
uation of the arguments for and against a speciﬁc conclusion. For example, she
might seek to answer the question: Could a rational fact-ﬁnder have concluded
that the evidence in the Sacco and Vanzetti (page 21) case, after the revelation that

125
bullet III could not have been ﬁred from the gun that ﬁred bullets I, II, and IV,
established beyond a reasonable doubt that it was Sacco who ﬁred the shot that
killed Berardelli?1
Adopting the standpoint of a historian can serve to isolate the tasks of analysis
and evaluation from other tasks. Historians do not have to concern themselves with
proceduraltechnicalities,admissibility,questionsofrole,tactics,ethicalconstraints,
or other “noise” factors to the same extent as participants in actual trials. On the
other hand, historians do not have a formal concept of materiality that deﬁnes the
ultimate probandum.2
In analyzing trial records, law students often ﬁnd it difﬁcult to keep separate
the concept of the original event (Did X happen?) and the proceedings at trial,
which may have involved lack of due process, poor or unethical advocacy, or bias
or prejudice on the part of the judge or jury (Did the evidence presented justify the
result?). None of the latter factors should inﬂuence a historian’s judgment about
the original event. Trial records are useful sources of evidence for a historian, but
they may involve “noise” factors that are irrelevant to a historical judgment about
the original event rather than the trial.
In Able, our standpoint might be stated as follows. Who are we? We are the
lawyers representing Richard Able in United States v. Able. The case is ready for trial
and discovery has closed. The evidence in the case ﬁle is the only material available.
We are preparing the case for trial and seek to marshal the available evidence and
inferences to maximize the likelihood that Able will be found not guilty.
Step2. Formulating the ultimate probandum. For every case, the lawyer must identify
the rule or rules of law that will (or that she believes will) control the case and
formulate a proposition or propositions of fact, the ultimate probandum, that must
be proved in order to satisfy the conditions required by the rule or rules. For United
States v. Able, we could have looked at the Internal Revenue Code for the proposition
of law that the government’s ultimate probandum must satisfy, but for present
purposes we need only look at the indictment. Because the court has denied Able’s
motion to dismiss, it was established for this case, at the trial level, that the facts
alleged in the indictment, if proved, are sufﬁcient to support a guilty verdict.3
1 See Schum and Kadane (1996) for a full analysis.
2 Of course, historians are not of one kind. They too have to be concerned with objectives, biases, and
context. Even for the historian standpoint, role and objectives need to be deﬁned with precision.
See Twining and Hampsher-Monk (2003), esp. Geller, “The Last Wedge” (at 122) and Anderson,
“WigmoreMeets‘TheLastWedge’”(at140)foranillustrationoftheapplicationofthechartmethod
to a historical problem. Other published applications of the chart method include Anderson (1999)
(Huddleston); Dingley (1999) (The Ballpoint case – cf. the approach of Feteris (1999) to the same
case); Wigmore, Science (Umilian and Hatchett).
3 Our motion to dismiss the indictment would have asserted that the indictment failed to allege facts
sufﬁcient to state a violation of Section 7201 of the Internal Revenue Code, i.e. that it failed to
allege an ultimate probandum that satisﬁed the conditions mandated using Section 7201 as a major
premise. Given our standpoint, the issues raised by that motion are matters to be considered by
appellate counsel in the event Able is convicted.

Analysis of Evidence
Thus, from the indictment the ultimate probandum can be formulated:
1 Richard Able (“RA”) knowingly ﬁled a false federal tax return for the year 2003 (“the
2003 return”) with intent to defraud the government of income tax due and owing on
not less than $45,000.
Step 3. Formulate the potential penultimate probanda. The ultimate probandum for
United States v. Able can be divided into seven penultimate probanda:
2 RA knowingly ﬁled a false income tax return for the year 2003.
3 RA ﬁled a tax return for the year 2003.
4 The tax return that RA ﬁled for 2003 was false.
5 RA knew his 2003 tax return was false when he ﬁled it.
6 At the time RA ﬁled his 2003 tax return, he intended to defraud the government of
income tax due and owing on not less than $45,000.
7 RA owed the government taxes on an additional $45,000 at the time he ﬁled his 2003
tax return.
8 RA intended to defraud the government of the taxes due and owing at the time he
ﬁled his 2003 tax return.
In United States v. Able the law was reasonably clear. However, situations often
arise in which it is not certain how a court will interpret the applicable law. For
instance, in Sargent (page 28) it is not clear how a court will interpret the insurance
policy: Would being killed by a bear or dying from starvation count as an “accidental
injury”? Such questions need to be researched, but if research does not provide a
clear answer, how is the analyst to proceed? There is no easy way out. As a rule
of thumb one needs to prepare alternative arguments based on “pessimistic” and
“optimistic” interpretations of the applicable law, bearing in mind that the most
pessimistic interpretation is likely to be the foundation for the strongest case that
one’s opponent is likely to present.
Step 4. Formulate the provisional theories of the case (and choose the strategic ulti-
mate, penultimate, and intermediate probanda that best ﬁt the theory or theories).
For any case, the analyst must formulate what she sees as the strongest provisional
theories of the case for both sides. This is necessary for two reasons. First, the advo-
cate needs to know the theory she is most likely to confront in order to assess how
the evidence will be marshaled against her client. Second, if the opposing theory
is not developed, the advocate may wind up developing a theory that misses the
point, a theory that attacks a “straw man.”4
4 If the problem is a complex one involving a mixed mass of evidence, it is likely that there will be a
range of possible theories each of which would lead the analysis in signiﬁcantly different directions.
In order to make the task manageable, it may be necessary to eliminate some possibilities and
concentrate on one or more speciﬁc theories. Even historians and scientists do not have inﬁnite
resources to pursue endless lines of inquiry. Typically advocates have to settle for one theory (or at
least a limited number) at a fairly early stage. The precise timing of such choices naturally varies
according to circumstance. On the relationship between stories, theories, and themes see Ch. 10
below.

The chart method
127
Thus, for United States v. Able, in order to effectively develop a theory for the
defense, we need to identify the theory that the prosecutors are likely to adopt. For
the government in Able, the theory is likely to be:
Prior to leaving practice in 2002, RA was earning more than $450,000 per year.
When he became a professor, his income dropped precipitously. The amount
he needed to support the lifestyle he wanted to maintain and meet his other
obligations exceeded the amount that the law school paid him. His income for
2003 was $170,000 – $125,000 from the law school and $45,000 in fees. In order
to avoid paying the additional amount that was due as a result of the $45,000 in
fees he had received, RA ﬁled a false tax return that only reported the $125,000 he
had earned as salary and from which an amount sufﬁcient to satisfy the taxes due
on that amount had been withheld. Thus, RA knowingly ﬁled a false tax return
for 2003 with intent to defraud the federal government of the taxes that were due
and owing on the additional $45,000 he had received as fees.
Given the probable theory the government will adopt, the strongest provisional
theory for Able might be:
RA fully disclosed all his income to Timothy Cooper, his accountant, and relied
upon Cooper to prepare and ﬁle his pre-signed return. RA informed Cooper he
had received $125,000 in salary from the law school at their ﬁrst meeting. On
April 12, his girlfriend, Jane Evans, delivered a letter to Cooper’s ofﬁce advising
him that RA had also earned $45,000 in fees. With that letter RA enclosed a blank
tax return that he had signed and a signed check payable to the Internal Revenue
Service with the amount left blank. In that letter, RA advised Cooper that he
was going to be out of town until after April 15, 2004, and instructed Cooper to
complete the return and to insert in the check the amount that was due to the
government. Thus, RA did not know that the tax return Cooper prepared and
ﬁled was false and RA fully intended to pay any additional taxes that were due
and owing on the $45,000 he had received as fees.
Having identiﬁed these provisional theories, it is possible to strategically refor-
mulatethepenultimateprobandatosimplifytheanalysisbyrephrasingpropositions
3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 to focus the analysis more precisely on the material facts that are in
dispute:
3 An income tax return for the year 2003 (“the 2003 return”) signed by RA was ﬁled.
4 The 2003 return was false.
5 At the time the 2003 return was ﬁled, RA knew that the 2003 return was false.
7 At the time the 2003 return was ﬁled, RA owed the government taxes on the $45,000
RA received as fees during the year 2003.
8 At the time the 2003 return was ﬁled, RA intended to defraud the government of the
taxes due and owing on $45,000.

Analysis of Evidence
As restated, only penultimate probanda 5 and 8 are in dispute. These propositions
should be the analyst’s “targets” in analyzing and marshaling the evidence . This
macroscopic analysis of the case is depicted in charted form in Figure 5.1.
Figure 5.1 Chart (Able)
Step 5. Formulate the key-list.
a. What is a key-list? A key-list is a numbered list of propositions of three kinds.
First, there are the propositions developed and reﬁned at the macroscopic level –
the ultimate and penultimate probanda and propositions identiﬁed as necessary in
light of the provisional theory adopted, e.g., that OJS had a motive to murder NBS.
Second, there are propositions that can be directly inferred from the evidential data,
e.g., from an autoptic proference of the 2003 tax return, we can infer that the tax
return reported that RA only earned $125,000 in 2003. Third, the list includes all
the intermediate proponent’s assertions, opponent’s explanatory, rival, and denial
propositions, and any propositions the proponent may use to undermine the oppo-
nent’s propositions or to strengthen her assertion in light of the opponent’s attacks.
Collectively, the key-list must include every proposition that the analyst concludes
is important to the arguments in support of and against the ultimate probandum.
The list is a key-list because every symbol in the chart has a number that identiﬁes
the proposition on the key-list which it depicts.
b. Formulating the propositions. The ﬁrst step is to identify those items of evi-
dential data that are available to be offered and convert them into simple proposi-
tions–i.e.propositionsinvolvingonlyoneconditionandsusceptibletotheresponse
“true/false,” “proven/not proven,” “probable/not probable,” etc. The next step is to

the credibility of a witness’s assertion. The process is not as mechanical as it might
seem. The analyst must confront two types of difﬁculty.
First, formulating the propositions on a key-list involves more than merely mak-
ing explicit what was perhaps formerly implicit or only partially expressed. It also
involves reﬁnement of expression, analogous to what is involved in drafting a statute
or formal document on the basis of a rough set of instructions. Indeed, the formu-
lation of the ultimate probandum may well require the same level of drafting skill
and precision. The formulation of evidential data into key-list propositions does
not require, for most practical purposes, the same degree of precision and rigor as
the drafting of legal instruments. The point at which precision becomes pedantry
typically depends on context. But the analogy with drafting is nevertheless useful.
Second, identifying and formulating the intermediate inferential propositions
necessary to establish the relevance of an evidential proposition to a fact of conse-
quence (a penultimate probandum or a proposition bearing upon the credibility
of a testimonial assertion or an item of tangible evidence) is ordinarily the hardest
and most important task. For example, the endorsement by the Las Vegas branch
of Able’s bank on the $25,000 check that Richard Able received from the New York
law ﬁrm supports a chain of inferences leading to an inference that RA had motive
to ﬁle a false tax return to avoid paying taxes on that amount. But the weaknesses
in that argument become apparent only if the intermediate inferential steps nec-
essary to support motive are identiﬁed with precision – i.e. RA gambled with all
or substantially all of the $25,000 supporting a further inference that RA lost all or
substantially all of the $25,000. The explanations that undermine the strength of
these inferences – i.e. RA may not have gambled or may have gambled with only a
modest amount, and RA may have won or may have quit after he had lost an amount
he could comfortably afford – and the generalizations that make them plausible are
not apparent absent precision.
There are no ﬁxed rules for drafting propositions, but it is possible to give some
guidance by way of advice. For example: Be precise. Be clear (avoid ambiguities).
Normally, each proposition on the key-list should make one point only, and this
should be signaled (for example, “It was OJS who killed NBS” rather than “OJS
killedNBS”).Sotoo,wherepossible,propositionsshouldbestatedintheafﬁrmative
rather than the negative. Trying to chart a negative creates difﬁculties that should
be unnecessary. Choose an appropriate level of generality for each proposition. So
far as possible, use language that signals clearly the connections with immediately
adjacent propositions. Be succinct and strive for economy – a cogent argument
needs to be well structured, economical, and clear. Again, skill in drafting a key-list
involves art as well as science.
c. Selecting propositions to be included. From the universe of data available, the
key-list may (and probably must) be limited to what is relevant to the ultimate
probandum. But visualizing what is relevant requires an intuitive application of the
inductive process we are trying to make explicit. Beware of cutting out potentially
relevant material too early; err on the side of over-inclusion in the ﬁrst cut. It is
simple to strike unnecessary evidentiary propositions from the key-list after the

Analysis of Evidence
chart is complete; it may well be impossible to see signiﬁcant relations if necessary
data have been omitted.
The process of developing and organizing the key-list is also reﬂexive. The ulti-
mate and penultimate probanda suggest intermediate probanda we want to reach.
But the evidential proposition may also suggest direct and intermediate inferences
and combinations whose relevance will be apparent only when formulated. The
propositions on the list should be ordered “logically,” but there is a danger that
too early an effort at structure and coherence will cause us to overlook important
hypotheses.
Several points deserve further comment. First, identifying standpoint and rec-
ognizing the limits it imposes are crucial. For example, if the project calls for the
analysis of a decided case such as Morrison v. Jenkins (page 31), the data available for
analysis are ﬁxed. Nothing can be added. The role of the analyst is analogous to the
role of a historian. In this context, all the evidence has been collected. The exercise
then is to analyze a given mixed mass of evidence that constitutes the data upon
which the decision was based in light of a declared ultimate probandum. If this
standpoint is adopted, the natural next step is to compile a key-list. This involves
identifying, formulating, and ordering the reported propositions that are relevant
to the ultimate probandum or probanda as given, as well as any unstated inferential
propositions necessary to demonstrate the relevance of each reported proposition.
If the standpoint is that of an advocate, however, the problem of selection must
be addressed. Selection implies a given collection of pre-existing propositions from
which one chooses those that are relevant. But even where there is a ﬁnite body of
materialforanalysis,suchasapre-trialcollectionofdepositionsanddocuments,the
propositions are not already there, lined up like candidates on parade. A complex
processofextracting,individuating,andmakingexplicitstatementsinpropositional
form is involved, allowing considerable scope for both choice and creativity. To be
sure,theremaybestatementsintherecordthatmaybeliftedverbatimintoakey-list,
but these are likely to be exceptional.
Selection also requires more than sorting out the relevant from the irrelevant.
A proposition is relevant if it has some probative connection with an ultimate
probandum, that is, it tends to support, tends to negate, or tends to explain that
probandum either directly or indirectly. Relevance is a necessary condition for
inclusionofanevidentialpropositiononakey-list,butitisnotasufﬁcientcondition.
There is an almost inﬁnite possibility of regress and of more and more minute
analysis of any body of evidentiary materials. Inclusion in a key-list inevitably
involves making judgments of importance (non-triviality) that go beyond mere
theoretical relevance. Wigmore’s Science does not, and probably could not, provide
a clear set of criteria of importance. The importance criterion is simple to state, but
difﬁcult to apply. The ﬁnal product must include all, but only, those propositions
that are important in light of the theory of the case the advocate has adopted and the
theory that she anticipates opposing counsel will adopt. Again, in the preliminary
stages, caution must be exercised: Weeding is easier than inserting.

The chart method
131
It is often difﬁcult to judge whether to include generalizations on the key-list.
For example, it would clutter the key-list and obscure the argument if every gen-
eralization that serves as a warrant for an inference is included in the key-list. For
example, the proposition that X testiﬁed to Y tends to support Y because of the
generalization, “Testimonial evidence is usually true.” These and other common
generalizations are usually left unstated.
Ontheotherhand,anargumentoritsstrengthmaydependuponageneralization
that is not obvious and that may be disputed. For example, in “The Nine Mile Walk”
(pages 11–17), Welt asserts, “An inference can be logical and still not be true . . . Give
meanysentenceoftenortwelvewords,andI’llbuildyoualogicalchainofinferences
that you never dreamed of when you framed the sentence.” Kemelman challenges
Welt with the sentence, “A nine mile walk is no joke, especially in the rain.” Later
in the story when it appears Welt’s inferences may be true as well as logical, he asks
Kemelman, “Where did you get that sentence?” Kemelman responds, “It was just
a sentence. It simply popped into my head.” Welt immediately argues, “It couldn’t
have! It’s not the sort of sentence that pops into one’s head.” Welt’s argument
depends upon an experience-based generalization that was not apparent until he
explained it: “If you had taught composition as long as I have, you’d know that when
you ask someone for a sentence of ten words or so, you get an ordinary statement
such as ‘I like milk’ – with the other words made up by a modifying clause like,
‘because it is good for my health.’ The sentence you offered related to a particular
situation.”
One value of the chart method is that it enables the analyst to make explicit what
is normally left implicit. Because of the dangers and uncertainties surrounding
generalizations in the context of argumentation, it is good discipline to articulate
at least those generalizations that may play a signiﬁcant role in the argument and
that are not obvious or are vulnerable to attack.5
d. Ordering the propositions on the key-list. The propositions on the ﬁnal key-list
should be ordered, to the extent feasible, so that the structure of the argument is
apparent on its face. The easiest type of key-list for the reader to use is one that
presents the propositions in a form that conforms to the outline method of analysis
(discussed in Chapter 6, below). The penultimate probanda are the main headings,
and the supporting propositions are organized in a way that outlines the argument
under that heading.
This is not always feasible and, in some cases, it may facilitate the analyst’s work
to adopt other organizing principles. For example, some analysts prefer to ﬁrst
extract and individuate all of the evidential propositions onto the key-list before
beginning to identify the inferential propositions necessary to demonstrate their
relationships to the penultimate probanda (or to credibility). Clearly, if the chart is
the end product, there is no logical necessity for order within the key-list: The chart
deﬁnes the order. But practically, reading the key-list and working through a chart
5 Huddleston provides another illuminating example. See Chapter 1 at page 19 above.

Analysis of Evidence
are both enhanced if the propositions on the list are ordered logically. Common
sense, taking into account the purpose of the effort and the needs of the audience,
is likely to be a safe guide.
Step 6. Preparing the chart(s). The end products are the chart and the key-list. The
actual mechanics required to draw a chart are always laborious. They are especially
laborious in one’s ﬁrst attempts. The struggle is not only with the logic, but also
with recalling the correct symbols and laying it all out on paper. Based upon our
experiences and those of our students, we offer some suggestions that may aid those
embarking on a project for the ﬁrst time.
a After clarifying your standpoint, always start by charting the ultimate and
penultimate probanda and work “down” as far as your provisional theory allows. This
will serve several purposes: It will help you to visualize the structure of the case; it will
let you plan the space allocations for the chart or charts; and it may show you ways of
reorganizing parts of your key-list. (The macroscopic chart of Able above at page 128
provides a simple example.)
b Break the chart into sectors, and complete one sector at a time. If the evidential
propositions related to a particular penultimate probandum seem manageable in
number, chart them ﬁrst. Do the charting in “sector charts” on separate sheets of
81/2′′ × 11′′ paper6 and then identify these sector charts on a chart of your ultimate
and penultimate probanda. For example, in the Simpson case, the lawyers might have
charted the propositions bearing on opportunity as one sector. In the macroscopic
charting of the ultimate and penultimate probanda, under proposition 3, “It was OJS
who committed the act that caused NBS’s death,” the analyst would have had, as one
of the principal supports, the proposition, “OJS had an opportunity to commit the act
that caused NBS’s death.” Under the symbol for that proposition, the analyst might
have put “See chart B.” It is annoying to see a new relationship or possibility after you
have charted ﬁfteen propositions in a sector; it is devastating to encounter the same
problem after you have charted 150 propositions on a single sheet of paper. Moreover,
the ﬁnal product is easier to work with (and store) if it ﬁts in a binder or standard ﬁle.
c Do not assume that an autoptic proference or a proposition will appear only once in
the chart. A logic chart is not a jigsaw puzzle in which each piece ﬁts in only one place.
Do not assume that a piece of evidence supports only one inference. For example, the
prior tax returns in United States v. Able not only support inferences about how much
money he made as a partner in a law ﬁrm, but also support an important defense
inference – Able regularly relied upon accountants to prepare his income tax returns.7
d At every stage, check that each inferential relationship charted involves a genuine
inference. The best test is to ask whether the claimed inference is necessary to address
6 Most students draw their draft chart by hand, and those who are not comfortable with computer
drawing must draw their ﬁnal charts in the same way. There are standard logic templates that
have the necessary symbols. Using protractors with 81/2′′ × 11′′ graph paper facilitates the manual
drawing process.
7 The use of the same proposition to support different parts of an argument creates a signiﬁcant risk
of “circularity,” as illustrated by the analysis of Huddleston. See Anderson (1999) 468.

a real doubt. This step is critical. The function of the chart is to enable the preparer
and the audience to spot ﬂaws not previously apparent in the analysis and to enable
the advocate to correct or emphasize the ﬂaw.
e Detect and avoid common charting errors. It is important to remember that an
argument is different from a chronological table or a story. The relations between
propositions on a key-list in logical analysis are based upon relevance: propositions
tend to support or tend to negate other propositions. A common error in microscopic
analysis is using propositions to tell a story in terms of temporal relations (“and then,”
“and then” . . . ) or causal relations (“x happened because y happened”). Such errors
can easily be detected when the propositions are charted. They are often depicted as a
“string of pearls” all supporting a single proposition. On a chart, there is a single node
with ﬁve or ten nodes depicted as each providing independent support for that node.
If ten witnesses assert they saw X enter Y’s house at 4:15 p.m., the relationships are
correctly depicted. Otherwise the string indicates a problem. Alternatively, they are
depicted as a vertical string of pearls – e.g., a single testimonial assertion supporting a
catenate chain of ﬁve or more inferential steps supporting a single conclusion. Again,
it is possible to have that many nodes in a chain, but it is so rare as to excite immediate
suspicion.8
Step 7. Reﬁning and completing the analysis. The chart and key-list are means not
ends. As a guide to work, the ﬁrst ﬁve steps have proven useful in practice. But
at each step the judgments made and the analysis were necessarily tentative. The
end is to develop a logically sound analysis that, in light of the analyzer’s speciﬁc
objectives, organizes a mass of evidence and charts the inferences necessary to relate
allsigniﬁcantrelevantdatatotheultimatepropositioninissue.Typically,theprocess
of revision and reﬁnement is continuous, with judgments previously made being
revised in each succeeding step of the analysis. But the chart and key-list completed
through step 6 provide the ﬁrst real opportunity for analyzing and evaluating the
case-as-a-whole and testing the judgments initially made. This is where the true
value of the analysis as both intellectual exercise and practical work emerges most
clearly. For that reason, the analysis of the whole should be done as a separate
step.
Time permitting, this step should not be undertaken immediately and, in prac-
tice, should ordinarily be a collegial activity. Lay the record, the key-list, and the
chart aside for a few days. Ask a fellow student or a partner to read the record, the
key-list, and the chart to see if he or she can follow it, attack it, offer fresh insights.
Then, using the ﬁrst six steps as a guide, work through the materials and reﬁne or
adjust the key-list and chart as necessary.
For the trial lawyer, this is obviously and necessarily a continuous process. The
early phases of an investigation have suggested a tentative theory: The available
evidence, in light of established legal principles, suggests a plausible theory by
which a desirable ultimate proposition might be proven. But new supporting and

Analysis of Evidence
conﬂicting data will be added, and the analysis and theory must be continuously
revised. Indeed, the key-list and chart that the lawyer used in preparing for trial
must be ﬁnally reviewed and revised in light of the evidence actually admitted
and excluded during the course of the trial in order to prepare for closing argu-
ment. The utility of the key-list and chart, in that context, is that it makes it
possible for the lawyer to see immediately the effect of the evidence unexpect-
edly admitted or excluded on the theory of the case as previously developed and
charted.
The ﬁnal step should produce a product that accounts for all the signiﬁcant
relevant data that are available and that precisely and clearly identiﬁes the logical
organization and inferences necessary to relate those data to the ultimate proban-
dum. In the aggregate, it establishes and makes available for critical review the
lawyer’s theory of the case and in practice it provides the foundation for preparing
and executing the next task in the case at hand.
C. The symbols and their use
Wigmore’s chart method employs a system of symbols speciﬁcally designed to make
it feasible to depict the evidence and arguments that bear upon the material facts
in a legal dispute in graphic form. In this section, we ﬁrst present the symbols and
discuss their use. We then address the question: Do the beneﬁts justify the effort?
1. The basic Wigmorean palette9
The modiﬁed Wigmorean charting system or palette presented in this book requires
only eight symbols. Five are likely to be required for any chart:
the square for depicting testimonial assertions;
⃝
the circle for depicting circumstantial evidence or inferred propositions;
>
the open angle to identify an argument that provides an alternative
explanation for an inference proposed by the other side;
◁
a vertical triangle to identify an argument that corroborates a proposed
inference;
↑
←
a line to indicate the “direction” of a proposed inferential relationship
between or among propositions – a vertical line indicates “tends to
support”; horizontal lines indicate “tends to negate or weaken.” The
direction from evidential data to asserted inferences is always up, from
bottom to top. Directional arrows are only occasionally necessary where
the line standing alone might be misunderstood.10
9 We use the term “palette” as it has been adopted in computer jargon. Programs now exist for
constructing charts by using a speciﬁed palette of symbols, such as the basic Wigmorean palette
described in this section. See note 14 below and references cited there.
10 Each of these is a standard logic symbol that can be drawn using commercially available plastic
templates.

The chart method
135
The nature of a judicial trial makes it necessary to have symbols to identify the
kinds of evidential data or the source of the propositions the tribunal will be asked
to take as the basis for the arguments advanced. Wigmore speciﬁed two, and we
have found a third useful:
∞
(6) an inﬁnity symbol to identify testimonial assertions that the fact ﬁnd-
ers will hear or other autoptic proferences they will perceive with their
other senses;
¶
(7) a paragraph symbol to identify facts the tribunal will judicially notice
or otherwise accept without evidential support; and
G
(8) the letter “G” to denote a generalization that is likely to play a signif-
icant role in an argument in a case, but that is not a proposition that
will be supported by evidence or that the tribunal will be formally
asked to notice judicially.
These symbols satisfy the three conditions necessary for a chart method. First,
the system makes it possible to distinguish between the principal types of evidential
datathatwillbepresentedtothetribunal–testimonialassertions,tangibleevidence,
and judicially noticed facts – and to identify generalizations upon which particular
arguments depend.
Second, the system makes it possible to chart the ﬁve different probative processes
(above pages 94–98) involved in adjudicated cases. Proponent’s assertion can be
depicted by the use of lines to depict the relationships between a probans and the
probandum that the proponent claims it supports. The opponent’s explanation can
be depicted by the use of the open angle, to chart the data or generalizations offered
to support a proposition that provides an alternative explanation for a proponent’s
assertion. The opponent’s denial and the opponent’s rival can be depicted by the use
of squares and circles to depict the opponent’s argument and the use of a line and
directional arrow to depict the claim that they combine to support a proposition
that detracts from the related proponent’s assertion – that is, the use of a directional
arrow,pointingawayfromtheproponent’sassertionandtowardtherivalornegative
proposition the opponent has advanced.
Although rare, the distinction between “proponent’s corroboration,” as a proba-
tive process, and “corroboration,” as a logical structure, can sometimes be impor-
tant to an advocate preparing for trial or an analyst concerned with showing at
what stages evidence was introduced at trial. In that context, an additional sym-
bol to identify the proponent’s corroboration as a separate probative process is
useful. This may be done by the use of a vertical triangle connected by a line (with
or without a directional arrow) to the proponent’s assertion that it reinforces to
show the context in which the evidential data reinforcing the proponent’s claim
were or will be presented. This additional symbol makes it possible to distinguish
between the principal support for a proponent’s assertion and the corroborating
support available if, and perhaps admissible only if, the opponent challenges that
assertion.

Analysis of Evidence
Finally, the use of lines and directional arrows makes it possible to identify the
steps and inferential relationships in an argument in which it is claimed that propo-
sitions are logically related – that is, to depict what Wigmore called the probative
relations among evidential data and circumstantial propositions in a case and to
presentachart(orseriesofcharts)showingtheserelationshipsforacase-as-a-whole.
If the analyst stipulated that the direction of the inferential relationships depicted
is upward unless otherwise indicated then directional arrows are only necessary for
identifying rival or denial propositions. See chart 5.2 below.
2. The chart method illustrated
These eight symbols are sufﬁcient to construct a chart that depicts the possible argu-
mentsinacase.Thatpointisillustratedbythekey-listandchartthatfollow.Thekey-
list takes the propositions from “An investigation” (above, page 40) that were used
to illustrate different logical structures typically involved in making inferences and
adds some additional propositions for the defense. The ultimate probandum in the
case remains, “It was X who murdered Y.” The key-list and chart were prepared from
the standpoint of a lawyer early in the investigation trying to identify and analyze
the arguments that might be made from the available evidential data to support the
intermediate probandum, “X was in Y’s house at 4:30 p.m. on January 1” – the
time and place of the alleged murder of Y. The chart illustrates how these basic
symbols might be employed to depict arguments that could be made, based upon
the available data and how the different probative processes might be depicted
within a single chart. The key-list and chart will also lay the foundation for some
additional points developed below.
Two points merit immediate note. First, the arguments developed in the key-
list and depicted in the chart represent only one approach that the prosecutor
might have taken. For example, she might have decided (and might still decide)
that W2 should be called before W1, so that the convergent testimony might be
juxtaposed as support for P2 without holding W2 in reserve until W1 had been
impeached. Similarly, she might have identiﬁed other generalizations she thought
more signiﬁcant.
Second, the example in Figure 5.2 presents a simple key-list and a chart that
ﬁts comfortably on a single page. In a more complex case, it would ordinarily be
necessary to divide the argument into sectors and then to chart the sectors on dif-
ferent sheets of paper. For example, it is often useful to chart credibility separately.
If that is done, the chart of the propositions bearing upon a witness’s credibil-
ity would culminate in one proposition (or in some cases, two) expressing the
analyst’s judgment as to the impact on the witness’s credibility. In the credibil-
ity chart, the analyst would insert an open angle (if the analysis undermines the
witness’s credibility). If there is evidence reinforcing the witness’s credibility or
undermining the attack, the analyst would insert a vertical triangle (if there is evi-
dence that reinforces credibility) or a further open angle (if there are generalizations
or evidential data that can be marshaled to undermine the attack on the witness’s

credibility). In such a case, only the open angle(s) and the vertical triangle would
be appended to the credibility node for each assertion the witness makes with a
reference to the sector chart, e.g., “see chart 15,” where the micro credibility analysis
is depicted.

Analysis of Evidence

31 W1’s observational sensitivity may have been impaired.
32 At an identiﬁcation parade (line-up) held three days after the murder, W1 failed to
identify X.
33 A recent report of empirical research on eyewitness evidence suggests that eyewitness
statements reporting identifying characteristics of a suspect made in circumstances
approximating those under which W1 observed a person entering Y’s home
(proposition 2) are 100 percent correct in only 5 percent of the cases.
34 W1’s memory and objectivity are open to question.
35 W1 seemed to be very nervous and hesitant when questioned by the police.
36 G: People who are very nervous when they are being questioned by the police may
not be sure that their statements are true.

serious crime.
38 W1’s veracity may be questioned.
39 The credibility of W1’s identiﬁcation of the person who entered Y’s house is open to
serious question.
40 W1 is telling the truth as he recalls it.
41 W1 is a bank manager.
42 G: Bank managers are almost always truthful.
43 G: Most people would notice and recall that a person they had seen walked with a
pronounced limp.
44 It is highly probable that W1 did see a person with characteristics a, b, c, and d enter
Y’s house at 4:15 p.m. on January 1.
45 W2 is very short-sighted.
46 W2’s observational sensitivity may have been impaired.
47 W2 knew that X regularly visited Y’s house.
48 Y was X’s son.
49 W2 is Y’s brother.
50 X is also W2’s mother.
51 G: It is probable that a brother would know about regular visits between his mother
and his brother.
52 G: When someone sees a person, who has the characteristics of a person known to be
a regular visitor, leave a house, he or she is likely to conclude that the person leaving
is the person known to be a regular visitor.
53 W2’s expectations (objectivity bias) may have caused him to misidentify the person
he saw leave Y’s house at 4:45 p.m.
54 W2 stands to beneﬁt ﬁnancially from Y’s death.
55 G: A mother is usually a beneﬁciary of her son’s estate.
56 X is probably a beneﬁciary of Y’s estate.
57 G: Persons who are convicted of murder cannot receive any part of the victim’s estate.
58 The beneﬁt to W2 would probably increase if X were convicted of Y’s murder.
59 W2 has a motive to lie.
60 W2’s veracity is open to doubt.
61 W2’s identiﬁcation of Y is open to serious challenge.

Figure 5.2 Key-list and chart (“An investigation”)
The speciﬁed procedures are designed to enhance the rigor and enable the
“charter” to see possibilities and problems that otherwise might have passed unno-
ticed. The resulting product makes it possible for others, as well as the “charter,” to
provide rigorous critique and appraisal of the arguments advanced. But the pro-
cedures and the charting systems can only complement, never substitute for, the
intellectual skill and judgment of the lawyer.

Analysis of Evidence
the questions you ask Able on cross-examination to focus the jury’s attention on the
identiﬁed bases for doubting all of the important testimonial assertions you anticipate
that Able will make during his direct examination, if he takes the stand.
2 Switch: You are the defense attorney who will represent Able at trial. You have done
the same analysis and have identiﬁed questions you think a competent prosecutor
would ask. How would you suggest Able respond to each question? Are there any
opponent’s explanations you could offer to undermine any of the points developed by
the prosecutor’s attack? Is there evidence you might present that would reinforce
Able’s credibility? If so, prepare a key-list and chart the propositions identiﬁed. On
that basis, prepare an organized list of the questions you would ask on redirect and
specify the witnesses you might call to reinforce the credibility of his assertions.
3. Additional symbols, conventions and their utility
The key-list and chart presented above provide a foundation for appraising the
utility of other symbols and conventions that might be used in charting a particular
problem. The utility of additional symbols and conventions is largely a function of
the objectives of the person applying the method and of the characteristics of the
particular problem. We have identiﬁed further symbols and reﬁnements that have
proven useful when the standpoint is that of a lawyer preparing for trial. We discuss
speciﬁc symbols and other conventions and appraise their utility in the paragraphs
that follow.
There are three symbols that are frequently useful to the lawyer conducting an
analysis in preparation for trial. As a practical matter, facts are often stipulated to be
true by the parties (“S”); admitted by the pleadings (“A”); or not subject to genuine
dispute (“U”). They should, however, be employed with caution and precision.
Stipulated and admitted facts ordinarily can and must be formally introduced and
published at trial, albeit without testimony or other autoptic proference. Facts that
are not subject to dispute must nevertheless be supported by admissible evidence
unless they have been established by formal admission or stipulation. Precision is
necessary to ensure that those who might rely on the chart in preparing for trial are
not misled.
Every case will differ. The standard conventions may often need to be supple-
mented or adapted by case-speciﬁc conventions in a complex case. For example,
in cases in which questionable hearsay or propensity evidence has been or may be
admitted, two additional conventions may be useful. First, hearsay can be depicted
byplacingasquareinsidethecircledepictinganout-of-courtassertionthedeclarant
allegedly made. So too, if there is or was a dispute over the admissibility of certain
evidential data it is often useful to shade or color code the evidential data and the
inferences to be derived from those data so that the actual or potential effect of that
evidence may readily be identiﬁed.11 Indeed, in some cases there may be more than
11 See, e.g., Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284 (1973) and Crawford v. Washington, 124 S. Ct. 1354
(2004) (cases in which the admissibility of hearsay evidence was the central issue).

one kind of evidential data whose admissibility or use could be challenged, such as
a case involving both hearsay and propensity evidence that was or may be offered,12
or cases in which the same kind of evidence may be challenged on different grounds,
such as a case involving more than one witness testifying to an out-of-court asser-
tion in which different exceptions to the hearsay rule may apply.13 In such cases,
multiple colors or shadings may be useful.
Students embarking on the construction of a chart should realize that the stan-
dard conventions for the charting system may have to be modiﬁed or supplemented
for the particular chart. But they should also recognize that it is important to
articulate precisely any modiﬁed or special conventions adopted, so that others
familiar with the standard conventions may understand and appraise the prod-
uct. As in bridge, special conventions are likely to cause trouble unless they are
understood by your partner.
To achieve the latter objective, we advise students to begin with the simpliﬁed
Wigmorean eight-symbol system or palette described above and to explain carefully
anyadditionalsymbolsorconventionstheyadoptinconstructingaparticularchart.
The particular advantages of that system are three. The system was speciﬁcally
designed for charting the evidence in a legal dispute. The system employs symbols
that can be constructed with standard logic templates that are readily available.
Moreover and more important, computer software for the construction of charts
using this system has already been developed and will be further reﬁned in the
future.14
4. Three advantages of symbols and charting
Like other symbol systems, the chart method imposes a barrier to those who would
use it. They must ﬁrst master the symbols and their deﬁnitions and the protocols
speciﬁed for their use. Mastering such a system is hard work. This poses a question
that has thus far only been partly addressed: Are there signiﬁcant advantages that
can be realized by the use of symbols to chart the evidence and arguments in a legal
dispute that cannot be as easily achieved by other means? The answer is, in our view,
a ﬁrm “Yes.” We develop the basis for this view below.
The chart method, described above, has three essential advantages. First, it
requiresthepersondoingtheanalysistoidentifyandarticulatepreciselyeachpropo-
sition that she claims is a necessary step in the arguments in a case. The value to
be achieved is precision. Second, the method requires that the person employing
12 See United States v. Abel, 469 U.S. 45 (1984) (a case involving hearsay and extrinsic evidence with
an improperly prejudicial propensity effect offered to question the credibility of a witness).
13 See Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150 (1995) (a case involving hearsay statements from the same
declarant offered through different witnesses, where the potential exception depended upon the
status of the witness).

Analysis of Evidence
it specify with precision each step in each argument being advanced. This makes
it possible to appraise each argument rigorously. Third, it provides a method of
marshaling all the relevant and potentially relevant data in a complex case into a
single, coherent, and clear structure in the form of an argument.
The use of symbols and charting is, in our view, necessary to realize all three
advantages simultaneously and to realize the second and third fully. The chart is
a graphic depiction of the arguments in a case-as-a-whole (or of a complex set of
argumentsbearingonaparticularaspectofacase).Thespeciﬁcargumentsadvanced
and their support are shown in a form that makes it simple to see and appraise the
structure and content of the arguments being advanced. The chart also makes it
possible to specify the evidence and arguments likely to be advanced in opposition
or available for corroboration in a form that facilitates analysis and appraisal of the
parts and the whole of the speciﬁc argument under study and its relationship to
other arguments in the case-as-a-whole. In short, the chart and key-list are devices
that make it possible to present all the evidence and arguments in a form that
facilitates analysis, understanding, and appraisal.
Wigmore’s chart method of analysis, as we have modiﬁed it, serves the same
functions and has the same advantages as the symbols and related methods of anal-
ysis established in other ﬁelds.15 It facilitates understanding, analysis, and appraisal
precisely because it employs a format that focuses upon the precise steps in the
arguments advanced and makes it possible to depict the results of the analysis of a
complex problem in a concise form. In our view, a method that employs symbols
and charting is the only method that makes it possible to present all the arguments
in a case in a form and format that enhances clarity and understanding and that
best facilitates rigorous appraisal and critique.
Any system that satisﬁes the necessary conditions for analyzing and charting
the available evidence in a case will, in its nature, involve complexity and require
considerable effort for mastery and application. Computer drawing systems and
other systems under development may well reduce the now formidable mechanical
effort required to draw and revise the charts for a complex case in much the same
way that word processing software has reduced the mechanical effort necessary to
construct and revise complex documents. Those efforts will not, however, signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the amount of intellectual skill and energy necessary to conduct the
analysis and marshal the resulting arguments.

in the chart method has the property that Whitehead identiﬁed as crucial to a good system: “It
should be concise, so as to be visible at one glance of the eye [and] the juxtaposition of important
symbols should have an important meaning.” Whitehead (1939), 58, 60–62.

The exercise continues: State v. Archer (III)
1. Defense counsel’s standpoint
Preparation of Archer’s defense to the charge he murdered Vern continues. [Review
the facts already developed and analyzed in the exercise on State v. Archer (II)
(page 109) above.] The statement made by Archer at his initial interview included
the following extracts:
On the Sunday on which Vern was murdered, I spent the day at home. It rained all day
so I worked around the house and read the Times. I went to dinner at a neighborhood
restaurant around 6:00 p.m. I returned shortly after 7:00 p.m. and watched television. I
went to bed after the 10 o’clock news. I slept till 7:30 Monday morning. Because it was
still raining, I did not arrive at work till 10:30 a.m. . . .
. . . I have never owned a brown Harris tweed jacket, and I don’t know how the jacket
Detective Paul found came to be in my closet . . .
. . . I invited two couples from my ofﬁce and my girlfriend to my house for dinner
on Saturday evening. The party lasted till about 11:00 p.m. No one visited me at home
on Sunday or Monday. Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Boswell, Uncle Vern’s former partner,
called. He said Detective Paul had interviewed him and had also interviewed Mr. Carl.
Carl and Vern had been friends until Carl’s sister committed suicide when Uncle Vern
refused to marry her. Boswell suggested the three of us should get together. I invited
them to stop by that evening after dinner for drinks. They came around 9:00 p.m. and
stayed till 11:00 p.m. I guess they just wanted to reassure me that, even though each of
them hated the old skinﬂint, neither had murdered him. We all felt vulnerable because
each of us had stayed home alone that Sunday . . .
. . . I don’t recall exactly what Boswell or Carl was wearing, but I do recall that it was
a crisp, chilly evening and that they were wearing coats and jackets when they arrived.
I think I would have noticed if either had left without his coat . . .
You have since received a copy of the coroner’s report, which ﬁxes the time of Vern’s
death between 11:00 p.m. and midnight Sunday.
For the moment, your analysis continues to focus upon the scrap of cloth and the
jacket and the circumstances in which each was found. The ultimate probandum
remains: “It was Archer who murdered Vern.” You obviously want to obtain and
present evidence that will preclude the jury’s ﬁnding that proposition to have been
proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
a Using the prosecution’s propositions developed for State v. Archer (II) (with any
amendments you now think appropriate), identify and frame the penultimate and
strategic propositions you think the prosecutor will attempt to support with the
evidential propositions relevant to the scrap of cloth, the jacket, and the
circumstances in which each was found. Again, with such revisions as now appear
necessary, do a preliminary chart showing the relationship between these
propositions. (Polishing the chart comes later.)

Analysis of Evidence
b As defense counsel, the rival probandum for the defense is: “It was someone other
than Archer who murdered Vern.”16 Archer’s statement read with Paul’s can be
analyzed from two standpoints: It suggests several hypotheses that should be
investigated, but it also provides certain facts to which Archer can testify directly.
Obviously, you must be concerned with both standpoints, but before planning the
further investigations, we must analyze the evidential data in hand.
i Formulate your standpoint as counsel for the defense. State and number the
ultimate probandum and penultimate probanda the prosecution must prove.
Formulate the strongest theory for the prosecution and for the defense. Add any
defense propositions that would directly undermine one or more of the
penultimate probanda that the prosecution must prove.
ii Identify and formulate a defense key-list of evidential propositions available from
Archer’s and Paul’s statements that appear relevant to explain away, deny, or rival
the inferences the prosecution may seek to establish. Identify and formulate as
simple propositions the circumstantial inferences your evidential propositions
suggest. Order these propositions as best you can and number each. (It may
simplify the charting task if you use different numbers from those used to label
the prosecution propositions you have identiﬁed and formulated – for instance, if
you have 25 prosecution propositions, start your defense list with number 50 and
proceed.) Label each proposition opponent’s explanation (OE), opponent’s
rivalry (OR), or opponent’s denial (OD).
iii Chart the propositions on the key-list, ﬁrst to depict the strongest argument for
the prosecution; then depict the strongest arguments for the defense to
undermine the prosecution’s argument and to develop a rival theory adopted for
the defense. Depict the additions to the prosecution chart made by adding
symbols for your propositions to the chart.
2. Defense investigation
Now formulate as hypotheses the additional intermediate probanda that will guide
your investigation. What, if any, additional questions do you have for Archer? Or for
Paul (assuming he would respond)? What information do you need from or about
Boswell? Carl? Assuming time and resources are limited, how would you organize
the investigation?
16 Evidence supporting this rival proposition need only make it a plausible hypothesis to demonstrate
that the evidence cannot be marshaled to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was Archer
who murdered Vern.

Outlines, chronologies, and narrative
The outline method of analysis and its variants are more familiar to practicing
lawyers. They have the advantage that they are easier to use than the chart method,
althoughitishardertomaintaintherigorthatthechartmethodrequires.Inaddition
to these two methods of analysis, there are two analytic devices in common use,
narrativesandchronologies,thatcomplementandfacilitatetheuseofbothmethods
of analysis. In Part A of this chapter, we describe and illustrate the outline method
of analysis. In Part B, we describe the analytic devices and discuss their utility. In
Part C, we discuss how and with what effect the methods and devices can be used at
various stages of a litigated case. In Part D, we describe the essential tools by which
the products of an analysis may be converted into forms useful to a lawyer at any
stage of a case.
A. The outline method of analysis
One of the strengths of the outline method is its utility in organizing the evidence
and arguments. In the outline, each of the penultimate probanda is a main heading
in the outline. For example in the Simpson case, the outline would begin:
I NBS is dead.
II NBS died as the result of an unlawful act.
III It was OJS who committed the act that caused NBS’s death.
IV The person who committed the acts that caused NBS’s death acted with malice
aforethought.
Given the prosecution’s provisional theory of the case, the central fact in dis-
pute was the third penultimate probandum. The outline under that heading might
continue:
III It was OJS who committed the act that caused NBS’s death.
A The Physical Evidence: OJS was present at the scene when the act was committed.
B Motive: OJS had motive to kill NBS.
C Opportunity: OJS could have committed the murder.
1 NBS was murdered at 10:15 p.m. or shortly thereafter.

Analysis of Evidence
a The plaintive wail of NBS’s Akita dog establishes that NBS and RLG were
murdered at approximately 10:15 p.m. on June 12.
i PF testimony, I heard the plaintive wail of a dog at 10:15 p.m. on June 12.
ii It was NBS’s dog that wailed.
(a) Other residents testiﬁed that they found a white Akita dog with blood
on its paws.
(b) Other witnesses testiﬁed that the Akita belonged to NBS.
iii Generalization: It is highly likely that a dog that discovers its owner’s
bloody body will begin wailing plaintively.
2 OJS had 35 to 40 minutes between the time NBS and RLG were murdered and
the time he emerged from his house for a limousine ride to the airport.
a The murder was committed at 10:15 p.m. (See III.C.1)
b OJS came out of his house to go to the airport at 11:00 p.m., dressed in
stone-washed jeans and a white-collared shirt with a black coat, with no
visible evidence of blood or other signs that he had been in a struggle.
c It takes about ﬁve minutes to drive at the speed limit from NBS’s townhouse to
OJS’s house (Vannatter).
3 Generalization: 40 to 45 minutes is almost certainly enough time for a murderer
who stabbed two victims to death to drive to his home ﬁve minutes from the
scene of the crime and to remove and pack the blood-stained clothing he had
worn at the scene, without leaving signiﬁcant trace evidence, and to shower,
dress, and compose himself for a trip.
a OJS could have driven from NBS’s condominium to his house, removed and
packed the blood-stained clothing he had worn at the scene, without leaving
signiﬁcant trace evidence, showered and dressed and composed himself for a
trip in less than 45 minutes.
The provisional outline of Point III is incomplete. The outline could be expanded
to account for all of the relevant evidential data and organized to show how it
supports the penultimate probanda in the case, and conventions could be adopted
that would make it possible to enter propositions that tend to explain away or rival
the inferences supporting proposition III. If the outline is started at the outset of a
case, it can readily be updated as new information is obtained by the insertion of
additional propositions. As a working tool it is far easier to maintain and update an
outline than it is to do and re-do a chart.
Exercise
In the Simpson case, Kato Kaelin testiﬁed he heard three loud thumps on the wall
outside his bedroom in back of the house at approximately 10:45 p.m. Alan Park
testiﬁed that he saw a six-foot African-American male weighing about 200 pounds
dressed in dark clothing enter the house 5 or 6 minutes before OJS emerged to go to
the airport. On cross-examination, Mr. Park acknowledged that the person he saw

147
might have been dressed in a black robe.1 How would you include these statements
and the inferences they support in the outline supporting proposition III.C?
B. Analytic devices: chronologies and narratives
Chronologies can be used to test completeness of an analysis at any stage of an
investigation. In most cases, it is useful to construct three kinds of chronologies –
witness-by-witness chronologies, document and other tangible evidence chronolo-
gies, and a master chronology. A witness chronology puts every event to which
a witness could testify in chronological order. This serves three purposes. It pro-
vides a basis for assessing the completeness and consistency of the witness’s likely
testimony. Are there additional facts that this witness should know? Are there ambi-
guities or inconsistencies that need to be clariﬁed and resolved? Second, it provides
a basis from which the lawyer can identify ways in which the witness’s testimony
can be presented in the most dramatically and strategically effective way. Where
does this witness’s testimony ﬁt in the story to be established (or refuted) at trial?
Can it be organized to present a coherent and dramatically effective chapter in that
story? Third, the witness (and tangible evidence) chronologies provide the basis for
constructing the master chronology.
In most cases the documents or other items of tangible evidence will be used
to establish or conﬁrm that an event occurred. The check Richard Able cashed on
December 20, 2001, establishes that Able received $25,000 income prior to the end
of the 2001 tax year. It also could be used to establish that Able was in Las Vegas on
that date. In some cases, the date on which a document or other item of tangible
evidence was prepared or discovered may be important. For example, the date on
which a deposition was taken or a letter written may be crucial, apart from their
contents, if either is offered as a prior consistent statement to rebut a charge of recent
fabrication or improper motive. The statements in such a document may be used
to establish the truth of the matter asserted only if the statement were made prior
to the date on which the motive to fabricate arose.2 The fact that Detective Paul
found the brown Harris tweed jacket in Archer’s closet only two days after Vern had
been murdered limits the period during which Archer could claim that the jacket
was left there by someone else. A tangible evidence chronology provides the other
basis for constructing the master chronology. It also may provide conﬁrmation for
an event to which a witness may testify, and it may identify gaps or inconsistencies
in a witness’s testimony that need to be ﬁlled or resolved.
The master chronology places all events that are or may be relevant to the case in
the order in which they occurred. At the early stages of a case, it enables the analyst
to identify gaps that require further investigation and hypotheses that should be

Analysis of Evidence
explored.Atthelaterstagesofacase,itbecomesadevicefortestingthecompleteness
of the chart or outline the analyst has prepared. Throughout, it is a device for
recording evidential propositions that should be considered in constructing a key-
list or an outline. At any stage, it provides the basis for identifying story possibilities
in the evidence.
The narrative, as an analytical device, can be used to construct logical stories
that could be supported by the evidence. A narrative is a device that complements,
but cannot substitute for, a detailed analysis. Once the analyst has identiﬁed and
reﬁned her ultimate and penultimate probanda and has developed her provisional
theory of the case and constructed a master chronology and a key-list and chart
or a detailed outline, the logical story possibilities for each side are ordinarily easy
to identify. In using the narrative as an analytical tool, the analyst is interested in
constructing stories that order the evidence so that it logically supports her theory
of the case.
In early stages of an investigation, the narrative further assists the analyst in
identifying gaps that must be ﬁlled in order to present evidence that supports the
narrative. It also further enables her to use the narrative to identify hypotheses to
be explored. In the later stages, the analyst will seek to construct a story that is
supported by and accounts for all of the evidence she intends to present to the
decision-maker and one that cannot be effectively undermined by the evidence she
anticipates her opponent will present. Ultimately, the objective is to create a story
that the fact-ﬁnder will accept as the most plausible (or, for the prosecution in a
criminal case, the only plausible) story of what happened that is supported by the
evidence.
The analyst must, however, be able to identify the logical weaknesses of the
narrative that she proposes to adopt and of the narrative that she anticipates her
opponent is likely to craft. The objective is to develop a persuasive narrative that
is not only consistent with and supported by the evidence, but that also minimizes
the possible points on which it is vulnerable to attack. She must also identify the
weaknesses of her opponent’s anticipated narrative account in order to plan how
she can persuade the fact-ﬁnder that it is ﬂawed or in any event less plausible than
the narrative she advocates. It is the atomistic analysis developed through the chart
or outline methods that makes this possible.
Exercise
1 In Simpson, the prosecutor’s narrative argued that the African American male in dark
clothing who entered the house ﬁve or six minutes before OJS emerged at 11:00 p.m.
was OJS returning from NBS’s condominium, the scene of the crime.3 Based upon the
analysis you developed for the preceding exercise, account for these facts in a narrative

2 From the evidence available in United States v. Able, it would be a simple matter for
the prosecution to develop a narrative that would support a headline statement of the
theory: “High Liver Comes on Hard Times; Lawyer Turned Law Professor Cheats on
Taxes to Maintain Exciting Lifestyle.” It would be equally simple for the defense to
develop a narrative that would support the headline: “Government Prosecutes
Innocent Taxpayer for Accountant’s Error.” Each has signiﬁcant weaknesses that
opposing counsel could use to attack it. Develop the narratives and then identify the
signiﬁcant weaknesses in each. Could the prosecution develop a revised theory of the
case and a different narrative that were equally strong, but that are less vulnerable to
attack? Could the defense? How?
C. The litigation context
The chart and outline methods of analysis are complementary. The initial analysis
is likely to employ the outline method. The penultimate probanda are the main
headingsintheoutline.Ifthequestionis,“Dowehaveenoughinformationtojustify
ﬁling a complaint?” an outline is frequently the most effective way to organize the
available and the anticipated data. As a device, the master chronology is a key-list
of evidential propositions ordered chronologically. The ordering makes it possible
to see conﬂicts and gaps without preparing a chart. It also makes it possible to
transform the evidence and possible inferences into a narrative account. Outlines,
chronologies, and narratives are ﬂuid; each can readily be updated and revised to
account for new evidence as it becomes available. The chart method, however, is
static: It is the most rigorous method for determining and assessing, at a particular
point in time, the extent to which the evidence can be marshaled to support or
undermine an ultimate probandum, but its products will remain the most time-
consuming to develop and revise. Against that background, we discuss the uses and
limits of the methods and the devices at various stages of litigation.
1. The stages of a case and the methods of analysis
Deﬁning the protocols for the methods of analysis does not answer three practical
questions of considerable importance. Which methods and devices are most useful
for recording the products of analysis over time as the case develops? At what stages
is a complete analysis worthwhile? Which method of analysis is likely to be most
useful at each of those stages?
Logical analysis is required at all stages from initial interview through settlement,
trial, or appeal. Most ofﬁce procedures used by lawyers have as one of their pur-
poses recording particular aspects of the analysis in a retrievable and usable form.
A memorandum documenting the results of an interview reports facts that the
lawyer thinks may be relevant. An outline for a deposition sets forth areas in which

Analysis of Evidence
the lawyer has concluded that the deponent may be able to testify or provide other
informationthatwillleadtoevidencethatisrelevanttofactsthatmustbeestablished
to support or confound the possible ultimate probandum that has been identiﬁed.
The memorandum of law is a device by which lawyers typically document the
research necessary to enable them to frame or revise the potential ultimate proban-
dum in a case. The case ﬁle itself is a device for compiling and maintaining such
products in an organized manner. Good lawyers have systems for maintaining case
ﬁles that are designed to organize the information in a form that facilitates ongoing
analysis. From this perspective, all these are subordinate devices for analysis.
An outline that organizes the available evidence by penultimate probanda is a
device that enables the lawyer to determine the state and sufﬁciency of the available
evidence at any stage. The form may differ, but the basic requirement for such a
device is that it serves as a precise index. It must identify each element that must
be proved under the theory provisionally adopted and each witness and exhibit
that is thought relevant to establishing or confounding that element. It should
also include a summary description of the evidence that the witness or exhibit
is expected to .provide that is relevant to that element. It should identify each
of the intermediate probanda, each item of evidential data that is, alone or in
combination, necessary to show the logical relation of the item to the penultimate
probandum it supports. Such an outline is an adaptable tool. Information provided
by new witnesses or documents can be inserted as discovered, and the lawyer can use
the device to identify particular necessary elements for which the evidence seems
inadequate or altogetherlacking and to determine where investigative efforts should
be concentrated.
At various stages, systematic analysis of the evidence for the case-as-a-whole
is also necessary. Most lawyers would probably agree that there are at least three
stages in a litigated case at which such systematic analysis is appropriate – before
the ﬁrst factual pleading is ﬁled, before the decision to forego further discovery
or investigation is made, and before the case is tried. In the ﬁrst stage, the outline
method is ordinarily sufﬁcient. The importance of the decisions that must be made
at the latter two stages may make it necessary that the chart method be employed.
We examine the ﬁrst two stages in some detail and describe methods of analysis that
seem appropriate for each. We comment upon ﬁnal trial preparation only brieﬂy
here, reserving a more detailed description for Chapter 12.
a. The pleading stage
Before the complaint or indictment is ﬁled, the lawyer for the plaintiff or the gov-
ernment should be satisﬁed that facts can be alleged that, if proved, would justify
a favorable judgment as a matter of law. The lawyer should also have a reasoned
basis for believing that she has, or is likely to be able to obtain, evidential data that
support each of the necessary allegations. These data should be at least sufﬁcient to
withstand a motion to dismiss the complaint or for judgment on the pleadings. In
order to frame the complaint, the lawyer must have a provisional theory or theories

151
of the case. That is, the lawyer must have identiﬁed one or more propositions of
substantive law; in light of the information available, she must have framed one
or more ultimate probanda that would bring the case within the scope of the legal
rule or rules identiﬁed; and she must have a reasoned basis for concluding that the
available facts, if accepted, would logically entitle the plaintiff or the government
to the relief sought. Even under notice-pleading rules, the plaintiff or prosecuting
authority must, at a minimum, allege the ultimate facts necessary to justify the out-
come sought. These allegations are, in effect, the penultimate probanda necessary
to support the theory or theories of the case provisionally adopted. Cost-beneﬁt
analysis reinforces the professional standards that require the lawyer to have a good
faith basis for believing that there is evidential data available sufﬁcient to sup-
port each of the necessary allegations before suit is ﬁled or speciﬁc defenses are
asserted.
On the other hand, time constraints and inaccessibility usually combine with
cost considerations to make it impracticable to develop and analyze the evidential
data fully before ﬁling the ﬁrst pleading. Much of the potential evidence may be
obtainable only through discovery, and one function of the pleadings is to deﬁne
the disputed issues of fact, in order that the parties and the court do not devote
needless time to considering facts that are not in dispute. Nonetheless, at this stage,
the lawyer should have rather carefully articulated statements of the provisionally
adopted ultimate probandum or probanda and should have identiﬁed and articu-
lated the provisional penultimate strategic probanda for each. The questions then
become: What evidential data do I have that support the inferences necessary to
argue that each of the penultimate probanda has been proved? From what sources
do I reasonably think I can obtain the additional evidence necessary to establish or
strengthen the required inferences?4
Many lawyers use an outline format for this stage. The ultimate probandum, the
penultimateprobanda,andthesupportingintermediateandevidentialpropositions
are organized in outline form, albeit in a somewhat summary fashion. The concern
here is the sufﬁciency of the allegations and the existence of a good faith basis for
believing they are provable.
b. Before the close of discovery and investigation
Intheearlystagesofadisputeandthroughouttheinvestigativestages,abductiverea-
soning is at least as important as inductive and deductive reasoning. Like Kemelman
in “The Nine Mile Walk” (above, page 11) or the police cadet in “An investigation”
(above, page 40), the lawyer is a detective looking for possibilities suggested by the
evidence or the nature of the case. In the early stages, the real danger is that the
lawyer will settle too quickly upon a single theory of the case and, often for that
reason, will fail to identify or consider additional sources of evidence that might be
4 The lawyer should also have memoranda documenting the legal research and analyses that support
what have been identiﬁed as the controlling propositions of law from which the ultimate probanda
have been derived.

Analysis of Evidence
explored. No analytic devices can be a substitute for the creative thought needed
during this (or other) phases of a case, but they can aid the lawyer in seeing gaps
and weaknesses that may warrant further investigative effort.
These dangers indicate the need for a comprehensive and structured analysis
before the investigative phase ends or is abandoned. Is there sufﬁcient evidence with
respect to each necessary element of the ultimate probandum to withstand a motion
for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff’s, prosecutor’s, or defendant’s case?
Can the evidential data be organized to support a compelling argument that each of
the elements has been proven to the required standard? Have any possible sources
of important data been overlooked? The lawyer must have a means of answering
each of these questions in a rigorous fashion before the opportunity for further
investigation ends.
It is at this point that a comprehensive and detailed method is necessary. The
outline – expanded to include every signiﬁcant proposition that would appear on a
key-list – is a necessary device for responding to the ﬁrst question and may provide
signiﬁcant aid in responding to the second and third. The chart method is for some,
including the authors, a device for depicting the logical relationships among the
propositions in a manner that permits more rigorous analysis and appraisal. In
many cases, micro-charts of crucial points coupled with a detailed outline might
sufﬁce. For example, the evidential data bearing on OJS’s opportunity would have
been and still is a good candidate for a detailed charted analysis.
Application of one or both of these methods also provides the foundation for
a more rigorous use of narrative. A narrative, in this context, provides a method
for reorganizing the data in a form that enables the lawyers involved to make a
reasoned judgment concerning the second inquiry: Can the available evidential data
be organized and presented in a form that makes a compelling logical argument for
the result sought? A narrative forces the lawyer to organize and present the analysis
in a familiar form. Placing aside rhetorical devices and dramatic organization, the
narrative method is designed to organize the evidence into a coherent story that is
logically supported by the evidence, which will enable the lawyer to assess whether
a jury would be likely to understand and, more important, be persuaded by the
theory it is intended to illustrate.5
c. Final trial preparation
If the analysis justiﬁes a decision to end the investigative phase, the lawyer has
presumably prepared the analysis upon which she will rely at trial. All the data
have been analyzed, and the inferences have been organized in relationship to the
ultimate probandum. The data are as complete as possible or feasible. What remains
is presentation. Key-lists and charts, outlines, chronologies, and narratives serve
5 Itisthisvirtuethat,intheauthors’view,makesitappropriatethatthenarrativemethodbeemployed
to complement and supplement other methods. Using the narrative method alone is dangerous.
The danger is that the “story” will take over, and the lawyer will pay inadequate attention to the
detail necessary to support each step in the argument.

additional strategic and practical functions when the task is organizing the data
for trial or other use. These functions and the other devices typically employed in
trial preparation are sufﬁciently important that they are developed more fully in
Chapter 12.
A further point should be emphasized. The utility of the chronologies and nar-
ratives is not limited to ﬁnal trial preparation. They may be employed at any stage
for appraisal and to facilitate translating the current state of the analysis into a
statement that facilitates use in other aspects of a case – in counseling a client about
the strengths and weaknesses of the case; in stimulating imaginative reasoning at
the investigative stages of a case; in persuading opposing counsel that a favorable
settlement is in the best interests of the opposing party; in identifying additional
witnesses or other evidence that might strengthen a case; or in persuading a judge
that the case requires a trial on the merits. Moreover, the notion of “narrative” and
the related notions of “theory of a case,” “story,” and “theme” are featured today
in many contemporary discussions of litigation theory and practice. Consideration
of the methods and devices and their utility requires preliminary consideration of
these related ideas also.
D. Theories, themes, stories, and situation-types
In order to prepare or to present a case, counsel for each of the parties must develop
a strong logical theory of the case. In most cases, especially those to be tried by a jury,
counsel must develop recurring themes that will serve as points of emphasis and
reinforcement with respect to crucial parts of the case. In each case, counsel must
use the theory adopted and the themes identiﬁed to construct a compelling story
of what the evidence in the case shows. In most cases, counsel will be better able to
develop and test their theories, themes, and stories by identifying and describing a
general situation into which the case ﬁts as illustrated by the story that reinforces
the need to ﬁnd the facts in a way that supports the result counsel seeks. We discuss
these concepts in greater detail in chapters that follow. For present purposes, we
need to draw fairly precise distinctions between four notions and identify the ways
in which methods of analysis contribute to their development.
The theory of a case, in advocacy, is the logical statement of the case-as-a-whole
selected by counsel from the available alternatives, in light of opposing counsel’s
anticipated theory and in light of counsel’s choice as to theme and story. The theory
should be capable of statement in the form of a series of syllogisms that demonstrate
that the desired conclusion is necessarily true, given the controlling legal principle
and the available evidence and assuming the truth of the proposed inferences.
The theory of the case is a product of analysis. For the Wigmorean lawyer, the
key-list and chart enable her to test her provisional theories and revise those theories
until she has settled on the theory that provides strongest support for her client’s
position and is least vulnerable to attack by opposing counsel, the theory that will
enable her to marshal the evidence that provides the strongest support for the

Analysis of Evidence
conclusion that the ultimate probandum has (or has not) been proved. The theory
adopted must be capable of statement in logical form. The lawyer should be able
to organize the data and marshal the arguments in syllogistic form to demonstrate
that, if all of the generalizations upon which the required inferences depend are
valid, the ultimate probandum must be accepted as proven to a certainty (or as
incapable of being proven to the required degree of certainty). In that sense the
theory of the case is a matter to be tested by logic.6
Theme: An English barrister described the theme of a case better than we could:
Having decided on a theory, you must pick a theme to ﬁt that theory. You must have two
goals in mind: First, why the other side is responsible for what happened and second,
why your client is not. For example, big business at its intolerant and unimaginative
worst; on the other hand, no one is perfect; there is a limit to the care and foresight
which the ordinary man like your client cannot be expected to possess, etc.7
Frequently, the theme is announced as the headline at the beginning of the
opening statement. For example, counsel might begin her opening statement in
Sargent v. Southern Accident Co. (above, page 28) with the assertion: “This is a story
about a heartless insurance company that chose to prolong the agony of grieving
parents by refusing to pay the amount due under the policy for which they had paid
until they proved the obvious – that their son is dead.”
Sometimes a theme may be expressed in a sentence or phrase that is used repeat-
edly for emphasis. For example, in Simpson one of the prosecutors challenged OJS
to put on the bloody glove that had allegedly been worn by the murderer and found
behind his house. It did not ﬁt. Throughout his closing, defense counsel sounded
the theme, “If it doesn’t ﬁt, you must acquit,” every time he identiﬁed items of the
prosecution’s evidence that could plausibly be interpreted as not supporting OJS’s
guilt.
The same barrister described the relationship between analysis and the develop-
ment of theory and theme and emphasized their importance as follows:
A primary task in any litigation is to develop a cohesive theory and theme of the case.
The theory should be that explanation of the facts which shows logic requires your side
to win and the theme should be that explanation of the facts which shows the moral
force is on your side. This strategy should provide a framework for assimilating the
facts in a manner which is most advantageous to your client. Since there are generally
some harmful facts in any litigation, you should choose a strategy which does not rely
on these facts and which makes such facts irrelevant . . .

strategy, the most exhaustive preparation, the most cogent argument, and the most
sympathetic case will be unavailing. While a cohesive theory cannot take the place of

thorough preparation and a favorable set of facts, it is the glue which holds together
the other elements required for successful litigation.8
The selection of the best theory of the case and its conversion into a compelling
narrative account, however, require more than logical analysis from the standpoints
of the proponent and opponent. It requires an understanding of the human and
physical material available as witnesses and other autoptic proferences and of the
signiﬁcant generalizations likely to inﬂuence a jury in a case of this kind. These are
the materials by which the story of the case as a whole must be presented and from
which the necessary themes can be established.
A story is a narrative account of a succession of events, ordinarily presented in
the chronological order in which they occurred, presented as a meaningful whole.9
Three elements are essential to the usage adopted here – a story is a narration of
events arranged in a time sequence; the narrated events are abstracted from their
disposition in the evidence presented at trial; and they are presented as a meaningful
totality.
In this usage, the “story of a case” would be the advocate’s narration of events
abstracted from the evidence and arranged in a sequence to persuade the fact-ﬁnder
that the story told is the most plausible account of what “really happened” that can
be constructed from the evidence that has been or will be presented. In advocacy,
the story must not include elements that are logically inconsistent with the theory of
the case and must be a plausible account, the main elements of which ﬁnd support
in the evidence.
It should be clear that construction of stories from the available evidential data
may be useful at any stage of the analysis. The master chronology and the narrative
are independently useful analytic devices. Both can reveal gaps in the evidence at a
time when further investigation or discovery might enable the advocate to ﬁll them
before trial. More, however, is required of a story in the context of a trial. It must
be a story the fact-ﬁnder, judge, or jury will ﬁnd compelling. Typically the story is
ﬁrst told as part of the opening statement, and is retold and urged as the only or
most probable account in closing argument.
Situation: We shall use the term “situation” where what is being described or
depicted is a state of affairs at a given moment of time as contrasted with a sequence
of events. A description of a situation is like a still photograph; a story is like a
moving picture. Both may be included in a narrative account. In this connection,
we have deliberately avoided using “scene,” because it tends to be used ambiguously
in lawyers’ talk. A “scene” may refer to a place (as in “the scene of the crime”) or to an
8 Id. at 1–2.
9 Two deﬁnitions offered by literary theorists are useful in the present context. In one view, a story
is a narrative of particular events arranged in a time sequence and forming a meaningful totality.
Adapted from P. Ricoeur (1981) 278–79. In another, the notion of story is limited to “the narrated
events, abstracted from their disposition in the text and reconstructed in their chronological order,
together with the participants in the event[s].” S. Rimmon-Kenan (1983) 3. See Rethinking, Ch. 7,
“Lawyers’ Stories” (for a fuller discussion of the role of story in advocacy and adjudication).

Analysis of Evidence
episode or part of a story (as in a scene in a play) or to a static situation (as in “he set
the scene before outlining the plot”). Although when used with precision “scene”
is often a useful term, loose usage glosses over distinctions that are important for
purposes of analysis.
In using situation sense, the advocate or judge categorizes the facts of the present
case as a type of situation and describes it at a level of generality and using language
that makes it ﬁt some recognizable general rule or principle that will justify the
desired outcome in this case.10 Consider, for example, the persuasive force of this
famous passage from a judgment of Lord Denning:
Did the accountants owe a duty of care to the plaintiff? . . . They were professional
accountants who prepared and put before him these accounts, knowing that he was
going to be guided by them in making an investment in the company. On the faith of
these accounts he did make the investment whereas if the accounts had been carefully
prepared, he would not have made the investment at all. The result is that he has lost
his money.11
Similarly, an advocate, in presenting her client’s story in a case involving disputed
issues of fact, might seek to characterize it as creating a situation in which the theory
and themes come together in a pattern that compels the result sought. For example,
an advocate might characterize the situation as one involving a professional advising
a non-professional and that professional expecting the advice to be relied upon.
The relationship between constructing theories, telling stories, and describing
situations, on the one hand, and constructing and analyzing arguments about evi-
dence, on the other, raises an important issue concerning the relationship between
story telling and atomistic analysis. Many trial lawyers and decision theorists believe
that juries (and other fact-ﬁnders) make “holistic” judgments – that they are per-
suaded by stories. In this view, juries choose between the two stories presented
by the contending lawyers (or adopt a variant of their own) and decide the case
accordingly. We largely agree with this view.12
In our view atomistic analysis is fundamental to story construction in the adver-
sarial system because:
In principle, the adversarial system is designed to assure generally sound processing of
information and resolution of questions of fact because it assigns primary responsibil-
ity for atomistic analysis and evaluation to the contending lawyers and appropriately
restricts the amount of information and the manner of its presentation to the ultimate
decision maker, be it judge or jury.13
10 Situation in this usage is often similar to Karl Llewellyn’s notion of “situation sense,” which he
developed in the context of appellate arguments about disputed questions of law. K. Llewellyn
(1960) 121–32, 268–74 . Note that “situation” in this context is not necessarily conﬁned to static
states of affairs.

Thepointtoberecognizedisthatthecommonlawadversarialmodelofadjudica-
tion allocates roles and functions in an appropriate fashion. The primary responsi-
bility for analysis is among the responsibilities assigned to the lawyers. It is they who
analyze the data; construct and critique hypotheses and arguments; and develop
what they see as the strongest theory of the case on each side.
They marshal the evidence and arguments that best support (or confound) the
contending theories. On the basis of that analysis, they construct the stories that
they will urge the ultimate decision-maker to adopt and identify points on which
the opposing side’s best story is likely to be most vulnerable.
In this model, using stories as the basis for decision is efﬁcient. In the common
law model the trial is a separate and isolated event. The lawyers for the contending
adversaries present the evidence that they have culled from the universe of available
and potentially relevant data and present the contending theories, arguments, and
storiesthattheyhaveselectedanddeveloped.Thecontendingstoriesandthelawyers’
argumentsattackinganddefendingeachstoryprovide,inprinciple,asoundmethod
of processing information to aid the judge or jury in resolving, efﬁciently, ﬁnally,
and accurately, the factual issues necessary to a fair judgment. So long as the analysts
have done their jobs well, it is hard to see why we would want a system that would
require the ultimate decision maker to replicate, rather than assess, their work as a
basis for resolving disputed questions of fact necessary to reach a judgment on the
case as a whole.14
Theprocessbywhichjuriesorotherfact-ﬁnderschoosebetweenstoriesislogical.
The evidence is rarely conclusive. If there are genuine factual disputes, the fact-
ﬁnder must form a belief by testing the available stories against a recollection of
the evidence and an assessment of the likelihood that a particular story is the most
plausible version of what really took place in light of their commonly held beliefs
or other generalizations. The nature of closing argument is to reassure the fact-
ﬁnder that the evidence “logically” makes one story the most plausible and to focus
its attention on the inconsistencies and logical fallacies in the opponent’s story in
relation to the central legal principles laid down by the judge. Of necessity (because
of such factors as time and audience attention span), the lawyers must strike for
the jugular: Normally, only the weakest links in the opposition’s chain of inferences
and only those that cut against belief in its story-as-a-whole can be attacked; there
is neither time nor purpose for attack on secondary detail. The making of such a
focused argument, however, must be preceded by logical, atomistic analysis and be
combined with judgment.
Atomistic analysis remains a central tool for identifying the plausible story possi-
bilities, for checking them for consistency and coherence, and for choosing among
them. It remains necessary, even though all must concede it is not sufﬁcient. In
that light, the contribution of the story-theorists is to focus attention upon the

of decision-making).

relationships between the logical theory of a case, the dramatic themes by which
the theory may be developed most plausibly in trial, and the story-as-a-whole.
State v. Archer (IV): the exercise concludes
The facts remain as developed through State v. Archer (III) (above, page 143). The
prosecutor has learned that Archer hosted the party on Saturday, the day preceding
the murder, and that Boswell and Carl had drinks at Archer’s house on the Tuesday
after the murder. Through Detective Paul’s interviews and investigations, she has
also learned that the termination of the partnership between Boswell and Vern was
initiated by Vern and left Boswell embittered and that Carl believed that Vern’s
refusal to marry his sister had caused her to commit suicide.
1. The prosecution standpoint
a
Theory of the case. Based upon the available data, state the theory of the case that you
now think a competent prosecutor should seek to develop. The statement should
compel the conclusion that Archer is guilty, if the facts assumed are accepted as true.
It should rely, however, only on those facts that are most likely to be accepted in light
of the evidence available to the prosecution and the defense. The statement should
take no more than a paragraph or two.
b
Story of the case. On the basis of the theory developed, construct the story that you
could argue is the only plausible story of what happened. Assuming that further
investigation did not undermine your provisional theory, this would be the story of
the evidence that you could recommend that the prosecution develop in her opening
statement. Again, compress the essential account into a couple of paragraphs.
c
Themes for the case. Identify and state the one or, at most, two best themes the
prosecutor might rely upon in presenting the case, if the provisional theory and story
withstand further investigation.
2. The defense standpoint
Assume the standpoint of counsel for the defendant. Through further interviews,
counselforthedefensehasalsolearnedthatBoswellwasbitteroverwhatheperceived
as Vern’s wrongful termination of their partnership and that Carl blamed Vern for
his only sister’s death. In appraising the case for the defense, you would have made
an assessment of the prosecution’s case similar to that developed in response to
item one of this exercise. Now repeat the exercise for the defense (a) stating the
provisional theory of the case for the defense in narrative form, (b) constructing
the most plausible story for the defense at this stage, and (c) identifying the one or
two most promising themes defense counsel might choose to develop.

Analyzing the decided case: anatomy
of a cause c´el`ebre
A. Introduction
Rex v. Bywaters and Thompson is one of England’s most famous causes c´el`ebres.
On January 9, 1923, Frederick Bywaters and Edith Thompson were hanged for the
murder of Edith’s husband Percy, just three months and six days after his death. The
case is an example of rough as well as speedy “justice.” Public opinion at the time
and subsequent commentators have been divided on the question whether Edith
was guilty as charged and on a number of subsidiary issues.
In our experience, Bywaters and Thompson is a particularly good vehicle for
classroom consideration of modiﬁed Wigmorean analysis for several reasons:
a It is interesting in itself;
b It is a good test of macroscopic analysis not only because it involves a complex mixed
mass of evidence, but also because uncertainties about the law relating to aiding and
abetting, conspiring and incitement, raise challenging questions about precisely what
it was that the prosecution had to prove in order to establish a case that was sufﬁcient
to support a conviction in respect of Edith;
c There were several possible theories of the case available to each side;
d Several key phases of the evidence, including some passages in Edith’s letters, invite
careful microscopic analysis; and
e Some of the key evidentiary issues relate to what Jerome Frank called “wild facts,” that
is to say issues relating to such elusive matters as motive, intent, the characters and
relationships of the main actors, and the language of lovers. Edith’s letters in
particular provide an excellent test of the uses and limitations of careful analysis. As
one student put it: “If you can analyze Edith’s prose, you can analyze anything.”
The materials presented here are a selection from the trial record of the proceed-
ings as published in the Notable British Trials Series (F. Young, 2nd edn., 1951).
This is only some of the evidence in the case, but it is sufﬁcient for present purposes.
We recommend that students read through the materials as a whole to orient them-
selves and to form a general impression and then work systematically through the
record using the questions at pages 220–23 as a guide. The main disputed issue at
the trial was and has remained: Was Edith guilty as charged in the ﬁrst indictment?
The prosecution did not proceed with the second indictment, but it raises some
interesting issues and provides some clues to the prosecution’s strategy at trial.

Analysis of Evidence
There is an extensive secondary literature on the case.1 We recommend, however,
that you work through the material before considering secondary literature, which
might serve as a diversion from the enterprise of applying modiﬁed Wigmorean
analysis to a particularly complex and elusive body of evidence and of appraising
the method in the context of analyzing a decided case.
OurexperiencehasbeenthatRexv.BywatersandThompson isaparticularlygood

at the end of this chapter are designed to follow the seven step protocol for the chart
method (Chapter 5, above). The case also provides useful illustrations of several
points about standpoint, theory and theme, “jugulars,” stories and generalizations
(see below, Chapter 10), and much else besides. However, many other trial records,
some rather less complex, are suitable for the purpose. So too are hypothetical
trial problems such as Wainwright and Weller (below, pages 326–9, 343–78). In
our experience, the following cases also work well either for discussion in class or
for written exercises. They are backed up by relevant literature, including the full
trial record: Sacco and Vanzetti; Leo Frank; Roger Tichborne; New Jersey v. Hauptman
(the Lindbergh Baby case); Louise Woodward (the Boston nanny case), the Lockerbie
bombing or O. J. Simpson.2

materials is vast. Based on our experience of teaching we recommend the following guidelines
for selection: (1) Primary materials (e.g. trial records) are preferable to secondary sources; (2)
The case should be sufﬁciently complex to illustrate the value of macroscopic analysis as a tool of
fact management; (3) There should be a historical doubt about the outcome. This is important to

to death. She now appeals against conviction. The charge against her was in point
of law that she was what is called a principal in the second degree; that is to say, that
she was a person present at the commission of the offence who aided and abetted
the commission of the offence, and, to put it in a slightly different way, the point
of the charge against this woman was that she incited and aided and abetted the
commission of this crime upon the night of the 3rd day of October. Now, before I
come to deal with the argument that has been presented on behalf of the appellant
by Sir Henry Curtis Bennett, it is necessary, as shortly as possible, to review some of
the facts of this essentially commonplace and unedifying case. The appellant, Edith
Jessie Thompson, is twenty-nine years of age. She is the daughter of a Mr. Graydon,
and seven years ago she married Mr. Percy Thompson, the man now dead, the only
person who in this case excites any sympathy.
At the time of his death he was thirty-two years of age. They lived in a part
of a house at Ilford, called No. 41 Kensington Gardens; and the evidence was
that the appellant and her husband were not on good terms with each other. She
was employed as manageress of a ﬁrm of milliners in Aldersgate Street, where she
received a salary of £6 a week in addition to a bonus. Some time ago, a considerable
time ago, the appellant made the acquaintance of Bywaters, a young steward on a
liner, whose case was dealt with this morning. He had stayed with them elsewhere
and in their own house, and it is quite obvious from many portions of the evidence
that the terms upon which she and Bywaters had come to be, long before the 3rd
October of this year, were terms of the most culpable intimacy. Bywaters was from
time to time absent on his ship. It is not necessary even for the sake of clearness to
examine closely the chronology in the case; but there were periods when he was at
home and there were periods when he was away, and the periods when he was away
are to a great extent covered by a remarkable and deplorable correspondence, full
of the most mischievous and perilous stuff. In August of last year Bywaters, accord-
ing to the evidence, made a statement to his mother about the unhappy life of
Mrs. Thompson, and the evidence showed, if the jury accepted it, as they appar-
ently did, that on more than one occasion Bywaters had called at the warehouse
where Mrs. Thompson was employed, that he had kept up this protracted corre-
spondence with her. The letters which are actually made exhibits began with the
11th of August, 1921, and they continue right down to the 2nd October, 1922 – that
is to say, the day before the commission of the crime – and the evidence further was
that after an absence of some weeks, Bywaters began a new period of leave on the
29th September last. There was evidence that he was with the appellant at a neigh-
bouring teashop upon that day; and again upon Tuesday, the 3rd day of October.
That was the day upon which the crime was committed. On that Tuesday, the 3rd
October, the appellant and her husband went to a theatre with the husband’s uncle,
Mr. Laxton. Upon that same evening Bywaters went to the house of the appellant’s
father; and it appears to have been mentioned at that house that the Thompsons had
gone to the theatre. Bywaters left about ten o’clock or a little after ten. Somewhat
later the appellant and her husband, with Mr. Laxton, went to the Piccadilly Tube

Analysis of Evidence
station, about a quarter to eleven. There, it was said, they were apparently on
good terms, and it is clear from what followed that they made their way home by
train to Ilford. Shortly before midnight a Miss Pittard was walking with Mr. and
Mrs. Clevely from Ilford station, and their way took them through a road called
Belgrave Road, and when they were between De Vere Gardens and Endsleigh
Gardens, both places not far from Kensington Gardens, where the Thompsons’
own house was, Mrs. Thompson came running to him. She was agitated and inco-
herent. She said – “Oh, my God, will you help me, my husband is ill; he is bleeding.”
And she said he was on the pavement and asked those persons to go or take her
and get a doctor. They took her to the house of a doctor, Dr. Maudsley, and then
Mrs. Thompson ran back. A witness was called named Webber, who lived about 30
or 40 yards away from that place, and he said that as he was going to bed he heard a
woman’s voice, a voice which he now recognised as Mrs. Thompson’s voice, calling
in piteous tones, “Oh, don’t, don’t.” He went outside, and three or four minutes
later he saw three persons coming from Dr. Maudsley’s house. Mrs. Thompson
was in front running and sobbing. He followed, and found Mrs. Thompson and
Mr. Thompson. He asked her if he could help, and she said, “Don’t touch him, don’t
touch him; a lady and a gentleman have gone off for a doctor.” Miss Pittard and
Mr. Clevely then came up, and they found the appellant kneeling down by
Mr. Thompson, who was lying upon the footpath in Belgrave Road with his back
propped against the wall. The place was dark. Mr. Clevely struck a match, and Miss
PittardaskedMrs.Thompsonwhathadhappened;andtheappellantanswered,“Oh,
do not ask me; I do not know. Somebody ﬂew past, and when I turned to speak
to him blood was pouring out of his mouth.” A few minutes later Dr. Maudsley
arrived, and he found that Mr. Thompson was dead. He thought he had been dead
then about ten minutes. Mrs. Thompson was standing by his side, and he described
her as being confused, hysterical, and agitated. He asked her if Mr. Thompson
had been ill coming home, and she said “No.” He told her that Mr. Thompson was
dead, and she said, “Why did not you come sooner and save him?” The doctor made
no examination then. He saw the blood. He did not see any wound, but he sent for
thepolice.Apolice sergeant took the appellant to herhouse,andonthewayshesaid,

body to the mortuary and undressed it, and it was examined; and a great number of
wounds were found upon it. The most serious wounds were three stabs, apparently
inﬂicted from behind, one of which penetrated down to and opened the gullet.
Mr. Thompson’s brother was sent for, and shortly before two o’clock in the
morning he arrived at Mrs. Thompson’s house. She told her brother-in-law that
Mr. Thompson was walking along and suddenly came over queer and said “Oh!”
and that on the way from the station he had complained of pains in his legs, and
that she had met a lady and gentleman and had gone for a doctor, and when they
got back he was dead.

At three o’clock in the morning two police sergeants went to Mrs. Thompson’s
house and saw her. She was asked if she could explain what had happened on the
road, and she said, “I do not know, I cannot say; I only know that my husband
suddenly dropped down and screamed out ‘Oh!’ I then rushed across the road and
saw a lady and gentleman, and asked them if they would help me, and they went
with me for the doctor.” She was asked whether she could account for the cuts on
her husband’s neck, and she said, “No. We were walking along, and my husband
said ‘Oh,’ and I said ‘Bear up,’ thinking he had one of his attacks.” He then fell on
her, and walked a little further. He then fell up against the wall and then on the
ground. She was asked if her husband carried a knife, and she said “No.” She was
asked if she was carrying a knife in her handbag, and she said “No.” She was also
asked if she or her husband saw or spoke to any person in Belgrave Road, and she
said, “No; I did not notice any one.” About eleven o’clock in the morning of the
4th October Inspector Hall saw Mrs. Thompson at her house, and she told him:
“We were coming along Belgrave Road and just passed the corner of Endsleigh
Gardens when I heard him call out, ‘Oh, er,’ and he fell up against me. I put out my
arms to save him, and found blood which I thought was coming from his mouth.
I tried to hold him up. He staggered for several yards towards Kensington Gardens
and then fell against the wall and slid down. He did not speak to me; I cannot
say if I spoke to him. I felt him, and found his clothing wet with blood. He never
moved after he fell. We had no quarrel on the way; we were quite happy together.
Immediately I saw blood I ran across the road to a doctor’s. I appealed to a lady
and gentleman who were passing, and the gentleman also went to the doctor’s. The
doctor came and told me my husband was dead. Just before he fell down I was
walking on his right hand side on the inside of the pavement nearest the wall. We
were side by side. I did not see anybody about at the time. My husband and I were
talkingaboutgoingtoadance.”ThateveningMrs.Thompsonwastakentothepolice
station, and on the 5th October she made a statement which became exhibit No. 3 at
the trial. I shall not read it all; but it is to be observed that in that statement made
when she went to the police station she says this: “I have always been on affectionate
terms with my husband. I remember Tuesday, the 3rd October, we both went to
our respective businesses that day; I met my husband by appointment at a quarter
to six in Aldersgate Street.” She then describes how they went to the theatre and
how they came home; and then she describes or purports to describe what took
place, and she says, amongst other things, this – “I cannot remember whether I
saw any one else there or not. I know there was no one there when he staggered
up against me.” She went on to speak of Bywaters and her knowledge of Bywaters.
She said, “I am not in possession of any letters he wrote to me. I have destroyed
them all, as is customary with me with all my correspondence. When he was at
home in England we were in the habit of going out occasionally together without
my husband’s knowledge.” According to that statement she had not seen Bywaters
that night; she did not associate Bywaters with what had taken place, and she was on
good terms with Mr. Thompson, her husband. Now it happened that at the police

Analysis of Evidence
station she saw Bywaters, who had been taken to the police station, and was in the
library as she passed, and she then said, “Oh God, oh God, what can I do? Why
did he do it? I did not want him to do it. I must tell the truth.” And then she made
a further statement, which is exhibit No. 4. In that short statement she said this –
“When we got near Endsleigh Gardens a man rushed out from the Gardens and
knocked me and pushed me away from my husband. I was dazed for a moment.
When I recovered I saw my husband scufﬂing with a man. The man who I know as
Freddie Bywaters was running away. He was wearing a blue overcoat and a grey hat.
I knew it was him although I did not see his face.” The two were afterwards charged
together. The knife with which these wounds had been inﬂicted was found in a
neighbouring drain, and I do not think I need dwell upon the rest of the evidence.
Dr. Spilsbury said that all the wounds except the one on the arm of Mr. Thompson
were stabs.
The appellant Bywaters gave evidence ﬁrst, and Mrs. Thompson gave evidence,
and I shall have to refer in a moment to the denials she made. She said, among
other things, that she ﬁrst fell in love with Bywaters in September, 1921, and that
she had told her husband that she had given him cause for divorce. The jury, having
heard the whole of the evidence, both that which I have summarised and much else,
came to the conclusion that the appellant was guilty of wilful murder.
Now, what are the pleas that are put forward on behalf of the appellant in this
appeal? Sir Henry Curtis Bennett at the outset stated, and very frankly stated, that
before he came into Court this morning he had decided to abandon that ground of
appeal which rested upon the allegation that this appellant and Bywaters ought to
have been tried separately, but were in fact tried together. That ground of appeal is
not persisted in. But Sir Henry says – he puts it in more than one way, but it is really
the same contention illustrated and sought to be enforced from different points of
view – that in order that this appellant might properly be convicted of this crime
there ought to be evidence showing not merely that as between her and Bywaters
there was a community of purpose in this matter, but that that community of
purpose continued right up to the crucial moment when the crime was committed;
and in regard to that complaint Sir Henry relies especially upon two matters. He
relies ﬁrst upon the letters and the use to which they were put or not put; and
secondly, he relies upon certain portions in the summing up, where he says the
learned judge not only misdirected the jury in the sense of inviting them to ﬁnd
what they could not ﬁnd, but also omitted to direct the jury in the sense that
he did not adequately put before the jury what the defence of the appellant was.
With regard to the letters, in the opinion of this Court there was more than one
ground upon which the use of these letters could be justiﬁed. It is enough for the
present purpose to say that they could be justiﬁed upon this ground – that by
means of them the prosecution were seeking to show that continuously over a long
period, beginning before and culminating in the time immediately antecedent to
the commission of the crime, Mrs. Thompson was, with every sort of ingenuity, by

precept and by example, actual or simulated, endeavouring to incite Bywaters to
the commission of this crime. I am not going to read those letters. There is a great
mass of them. Many of them were read at the trial. They begin in the summer of
1921, and they continue until the 2nd October, 1922; that is to say, they continue
until the day before the day upon which this crime was committed. Now, what is it
that those letters may reasonably be regarded as showing? First of all, they show a
passionate and, in the circumstances, a wicked affection between Mrs. Thompson
and Bywaters. Secondly, they contain what purport to be accounts of efforts which
have been made, sometimes without the assistance of Bywaters, sometimes with the
assistance of Bywaters, to get Mr. Thompson out of the way. Thirdly – and this is
a thread that runs through the whole skein of these letters – there is the continual
entreaty and hope that that which they both desire will somehow be accomplished.
Now, in the opinion of the Court, the theory that these letters, so far as they purport
to describe attempts made upon the life of Mr. Thompson, are mere nonsense –
“Vapour,” as Bywaters calls them – “Melodramatic nonsense,” as learned counsel
has thought ﬁt to call them – is a theory which cannot be accepted. But however that
may be, if the question is, as I think it was, whether these letters were evidence of a
protracted, continuous incitement to Bywaters to commit the crime which he did in
the end commit, it really is of comparatively little importance whether the appellant
was truly reporting something which she had done, or falsely reporting something
which she merely pretended to do. I am not going to read them; it is not necessary;
but reference may, perhaps, be made to one of them, which is the last. By this time
Bywaters was back in this country. The appellant and Bywaters were meeting. They
had ample opportunity of conversation and arrangement of any plan in which they
might be interested; and upon the 2nd of October the appellant wrote to him – “I
tried so hard to ﬁnd a way out of to-night, darlingest, but he was suspicious and still
is. . . . We ought to be able to use great big things for great big love like ours.” And
again – “Darlint, it is funds that are our stumbling block – until we have those, we
can do nothing.” That is not the only passage in the later correspondence in which
the appellant refers to the importance of money. Then she goes on – “Darlint do
something to-morrow night will you? something to make you forget. I’ll be hurt I
know, but I want you to hurt me – I do really – the bargain now seems so one-sided –
so unfair – but how can I alter it.” And ﬁnally, the last passage – “Don’t forget what
we talked in the tearoom. I’ll still risk and try if you will – we only have 33/4 years left

Taking that long summing up as a whole, and reading one part with the rest of
what the learned judge says, in the opinion of this Court it is not possible to found
upon it any unfavourable criticism. The case was clearly put before the jury. There
was simple evidence, partly direct evidence, partly evidence from which inference
might properly be drawn; and upon that evidence, in a case which exhibits from
beginning to end no redeeming feature, the members of the jury have convicted

conviction, and this appeal must be dismissed.

Examination of John Hancock
John Hancock, examined by Mr. Travers Humphreys – I am a detective
constable. I received a number of letters from Inspector Hall, which I examined
and had copied. There were also a number of newspaper cuttings in some of the
letters. On 9th October I found a knife (exhibit No. 1) in a drain on the north side
of Seymour Gardens, Ilford, about 250 yards from Kensington Gardens, Ilford. I
handed it to Inspector Hall. I did not ﬁnd any sheath. It is an English knife. I received
three letters from the witness Miss Jacobs (exhibits 14, 30, and 51). These letters are
signed by Bywaters. I searched the house at 41 Kensington Gardens, and I found a
bottle (exhibit 61) in a small drawer in Mr. and Mrs. Thompson’s bedroom. It has a
label, “Aromatic tincture of opium.” I handed the bottle to Mr. Webster, the analyst.
Cross-examined by Sir H. Curtis Bennett – Altogether I found 62 letters,
including telegrams, and of these 32 have been put in as exhibits in this case. In the
different letters there were some 50 enclosures, cuttings from newspapers, referring
to a variety of subjects. Of those cuttings about ten referred to cases which were
more or less in the public eye at the time. I have with me a list of the names of the
cuttings. It includes the following: –

Thelittlebottlewhichhasbeenproduced,containingaromatictinctureofopium,
was found by me in the small drawer in the chest of drawers in the bedroom which
was occupied by both Mr. and Mrs. Thompson. I did not see any of Mr. Thompson’s
collars and ties in that drawer. It contained envelopes, notepaper, photographs, and
gloves. I could not say whether it was his drawer or her drawer.
Examination of Richard Sellars
Richard Sellars, examined by Mr. Travers Humphreys – I am a divi-
sional detective inspector of police, K. Division. At 11 a.m. on 4th October I saw
Mrs. Thompson at her house, 41 Kensington Gardens, Ilford. I said to her, “I am an
inspector of police. I understand you were with your husband early this morning
in Belgrave Road. I am satisﬁed he was assaulted and stabbed several times.” She
said, “We were coming along Belgrave Road, and just past the corner of Endsleigh
Gardens, when I heard him call out, ‘Oh-er,’ and he fell up against me. I put out
my arms to save him, and found blood, which I thought was coming from his
mouth. I tried to help him up. He staggered for several yards towards Kensington
Gardens, and then fell against the wall and slid down; he did not speak to me. I
cannot say if I spoke to him. I felt him, and found his clothing wet with blood.
He never moved after he fell. We had no quarrel on the way; we were quite happy
together. Immediately I saw blood I ran across the road to a doctor’s. I appealed
to a lady and gentleman who were passing, and the gentleman also went to the
doctor’s. The doctor came, and told me my husband was dead. Just before he fell
down I was walking on his right hand side, on the inside of the pavement, nearest
the wall. We were side by side. I did not see anybody about at the time. My husband
and I were talking about going to a dance.” At that time Mrs. Thompson was in an
agitated condition. About 7 p.m. on the same day I saw the prisoner Bywaters at
the Ilford police station, and took possession of the overcoat he was wearing, which
is the one now produced. I saw Mrs. Thompson again a little later in the same
evening, after she had made her ﬁrst statement to me, and I afterwards took her
to the Ilford police station. I spoke to her again on the next day, 5th October, and
asked her if she would give me any further information regarding her husband’s
assailant. She said, “I will tell you if I possibly can,” and she made a voluntary state-
ment which was typewritten, read, and signed (exhibit No. 3). That statement is as
follows: –

Analysis of Evidence
Statement of Edith Jessie Thompson
Edith Jessie Thompson, 41 Kensington Gardens, Ilford, age 28, married,
states –
My husband’s name is Percy Thompson. He is a shipping clerk employed by
Messrs. O. J. Parker & Co., Peel House, Eastcheap, E. C.
I am employed by Carlton & Prior, millinery manufacturers, 168 Aldersgate
Street, E.C., as a book-keeper. We have been married six years and have no family.
We were married in the beginning of the year 1916. In that year my husband
joined the London Scottish Regiment, he was discharged as medically unﬁt a few
months later and did no foreign service. I have always been on affectionate terms
with my husband. I remember Tuesday, 3rd October 1922. We both went to our
respective businesses that day. I met my husband by appointment at a quarter to
six, in Aldersgate Street, that day, we went to the Criterion Theatre, we there met
my uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. J. Laxton, we left the Theatre about 11 p.m., we
all four went to the Piccadilly Circus Tube, we there separated, my husband and I
went to Liverpool Street, and we caught the 11.30 train to Ilford, we arrived at Ilford
about 12 o’clock, we then proceeded along York Road, Belgrave Road and when we
got between De Vere and Endsleigh Gardens, (we were walking on the right hand
side) my husband suddenly went into the roadway, I went after him, and he fell
up against me, and called out “oo-er.” He was staggering, he was bleeding, and I
thought that the blood was coming from his mouth. I cannot remember whether
I saw anyone else there or not. I know there was none there when he staggered up
against me. I got hold of my husband with both hands and assisted him to get up
against the wall. He stood there for about a minute or two and then slid down on to
the footway, he never spoke, I fell on the ground with him. I cannot remember if I
shouted out or not. I got up off the ground and ran along to Courtland Avenue, with
the intention of calling Dr. Maudsley, but on the way I met a lady and a gentleman
and I said to them something to this effect, “Can I get a doctor or help me, my
husband is ill.” The gentleman said, “I will go for the doctor.” Dr. Maudsley arrived
shortly after, although it seemed a long time. The doctor examined my husband
and said that he was dead. An ambulance was sent for and the body was removed.
I was accompanied to my home by two Police Ofﬁcers.
I know Freddie Bywaters, I have known him for several years; we were at school
together, at least I wasn’t but my two brothers were. He is residing with his widowed
mother at 11 Westow St., Norwood. He is a ship’s writer and periodically goes away
to sea. He has been for a very long time on visiting terms with my family. In June,
1921, Bywaters came to reside with my husband and myself at No. 41 Kensington
Gardens. He came as a paying guest. I think he paid 25s. or 27s. 6d. per week. He
was with us up to the beginning of August, 1921. I remember August Bank Holiday,
1921. My husband and I quarrelled about something, he struck me. I knocked a
chair over. Freddie came in and interfered on my behalf. I left the room and I do
not know what transpired between them. As far as my recollection goes, Freddie
left on the following Friday, but before he left my husband and he were friends

again. We have been in the habit of corresponding with one another. His letters to
me and mine to him were couched in affectionate terms. I am not in possession of
any letters he writes to me. I have destroyed all as is customary with me with all
my correspondence. The letters shown to me by Inspector Hall and addressed to
Mr. F. Bywaters are some of the letters that I wrote to Freddie, and were written to
him without my husband’s consent. When he was at home in England, we were in
the habit of going out occasionally together without my husband’s knowledge.
This statement has been read over to me. It is voluntary and it is true.
(Sgd.) Edith Thompson
Examination of Richard Sellars, Continued
After making that statement, Mrs. Thompson and I left the room; I took her to the
matron’s room. In doing so we passed the library, where Bywaters was detained.
She saw him as she passed, and she said, “Oh, God; oh, God, what can I do? Why
did he do it? I did not want him to do it.” She further said almost immediately
after, “I must tell the truth.” She was hysterical, and I said, “You realise what you
are saying; what you might say may be used in evidence.” She then proceeded to
make a statement, which again was written down and signed (exhibit No. 4). It is as
follows: –
Statement of Edith Thompson
When we got near Endsleigh Gardens a man rushed out from the Gardens and
knockedmeawayandpushedmeawayfrommyhusband.Iwasdazedforamoment.
When I recovered I saw my husband scufﬂing with a man. The man whom I know
as Freddie Bywaters was running away. He was wearing a blue overcoat and a grey
hat. I knew it was him although I did not see his face.
Examination of Richard Sellars, Continued
After taking Bywaters’ coat from him, it was examined by Dr. Drought, and after he
had examined it I said to Bywaters, “We shall detain you and retain possession of
your overcoat.” He said, “Why, I know nothing about it.” He commenced to speak
further, and I said, “If you wish to make a statement, it will be better to put it in
writing.” I cautioned him, and he made a statement which he signed in my presence
(exhibit No. 5).
Statement of Frederick Edward Francis Bywaters
4th October, 1922.
Frederick Edward Francis Bywaters, 11 Westow Street, Upper
Norwood, aged 20, Laundry Steward, states –
I have known Mr. Percy Thompson for about four years and his wife, Edith, for
about 7 years. Mr. Thompson is a shipping clerk; his wife is in a millinery business,
and they reside at 41 Kensington Gardens, Ilford. I stayed with them from June
18th, 1921, to the 1st August, 1921. The ﬁrst week that I was there, I was there as

Analysis of Evidence
their guest and the remaining weeks I paid 25s. per week. The cause of my leaving
was that Mr. Thompson quarrelled with Mrs. Thompson and threw her across the
room. I thought it was a very unmanly thing to do and I interfered. We had a quarrel
and he asked me to leave, and I left. I had always been exceedingly good friends with
Mrs. Thompson. I was also on visiting terms with the mother of Mrs. Thompson,
a Mrs. Graydon, who resides with her husband and family at 231 Shakespeare
Crescent, Manor Park. After I left Mrs. Thompson I went back to reside with my
mother at my present address. On the 7th September, 1921, I got a position as writer
on board the s.s. “Morea.” I sailed on the 9th September and returned to England
the end of the following month. Shortly after I came back from the voyage I called on
Mr.andMrs.Thompsonattheiraddress.Mrs.Thompsonreceivedmequitefriendly,
Mr. Thompson a little coldly, but we parted as friends. The same evening I called
on Mrs. Graydon and I there again saw Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, who were visiting
her. I have never called upon Mr. and Mrs. Thompson since that time. I have met
them once or twice at Mrs. Graydon’s since, the last time being in June last. Since
that date I have never seen Mr. Thompson. I have met Mrs. Thompson on several
occasions since and always by appointment. They were verbal appointments. On
MondaylastImetherbyappointmentat12.30atAldersgateStreet.Wewenttolunch
at the Queen Anne’s Restaurant, Cheapside. After lunch she returned to business
and I have not seen her since. Mr. Thompson was not aware of all our meetings, but
some of them he was. I have known for a very long time past that she had led a very
unhappy life with him. This is also known to members of Mrs. Thompson’s family. I
have written to her on two occasions. I signed the letters Freddie and I addressed her
as “Dear Edie.” On the evening of Monday, 2nd October, I called on Mrs. Graydon
and stayed there till about 10 o’clock. I never mentioned the fact that I had lunched
with Mrs. Thompson that day, and as far as I know Mr. Thompson was not aware
of it. I left my home yesterday morning about a quarter to twelve. I was dressed
in the same clothes that I am now wearing. I went up West and remained there
until the evening. I was alone and never met anyone that I knew. I then went to
Mrs. Graydon’s, arriving there about 7. I left about 11 o’clock, my impression is that
it had gone 11. Before leaving I remember Mrs. Graydon’s daughter Avis saying that
Percy (Mr. Thompson) had ‘phoned her up, and I gathered from the observations
she made that he was taking his wife to a theatre that night and that there was
other members of the family going. When I left the house I went through Browning
Road, into Sibley Grove, to East Ham Railway Station. I booked to Victoria which
is my usual custom. I caught a train at 11.30 p.m. and I arrived at Victoria about
12.30 a.m. I then discovered that the last train to Gypsy Hill had gone; it leaves at
12.10 a.m. I had a few pounds in money with me but I decided to walk. I went by
way of Vauxhall Road, and Vauxhall Bridge, Kensington, Brixton, turning to the
left into Dulwich, and then on to the Crystal Palace, and from there to my address
at Upper Norwood, arriving there about 3 a.m. I never noticed either ’bus or tram
going in my direction. On arriving home I let myself in with a latchkey and went
straight to my bedroom. My mother called out to me. She said. “Is that you, Mick?”

I replied, “Yes,” and then went to bed. I got up about 9 a.m. and about 12 I left
home with my mother. I left my mother in Paternoster Row about half past two. I
stayed in the City till about 5. I then went by train from Mark Lane to East Ham,
and from there went on to Mrs. Graydon’s, arriving there about six. The ﬁrst time
that I learned that Mr. Thompson had been killed was when I bought a newspaper
in Mark Lane before I got into the train to go to East Ham. I am never in the habit of
carrying a knife. In fact I have never had one. I never met a single person that I knew
from the time that I left Mrs. Graydon’s house until I arrived home. Mrs. Thompson
has written to me two or three times. I might have received one letter from her at
home. The others I have received on board ship. I have destroyed these letters. She
used to address me as “Dear Freddie,” and signed herself “Peidi.” I occupy the back
bedroom on the top ﬂoor at my address, and that is where I keep all my clothing.
When I said that I was dressed in precisely the same clothing yesterday as I am
to-day, I meant it to include my undergarments, with the exception of my collar
and handkerchief, which are at home.
This statement has been read over to me, is voluntary and is true.
(Sgd.) Frederick E. F. Bywaters
Examination of Richard Sellars, Continued
Having made some further inquiries, I again saw Bywaters on the evening of 5th
October, and said to him, “I am going to charge you and Mrs. Thompson with the
wilful murder of Percy Thompson.” He said, “Why her? Mrs. Thompson was not
aware of my movements.” I said, “If you wish to say anything, I will take it down
in writing.” I again cautioned him. He made a statement, which I read to him, and
which he signed. It is exhibit No. 6, and it is dated 5th October –
Statement of Frederick Bywaters
Frederick Bywaters states –
I wish to make a voluntary statement. Mrs. Edith Thompson was not aware of
my movements on Tuesday night, 3rd October. I left Manor Park at 11 p.m. and
proceeded to Ilford. I waited for Mrs. Thompson and her husband. When near
Endsleigh Gardens I pushed her to one side, also pushing him further up the street.
I said to him, “You have got to separate from your wife.” He said, “No.” I said,
“You will have to.” We struggled. I took my knife from my pocket and we fought
and he got the worst of it. Mrs. Thompson must have been spellbound for I saw
nothing of her during the ﬁght. I ran away through Endsleigh Gardens, through
Wanstead, Leytonstone, Stratford; got a taxi at Stratford to Aldgate, walked from
there to Fenchurch Street, got another taxi to Thornton Heath. Then walked to
Upper Norwood, arriving home about 3 a.m. The reason I fought with Thompson
was because he never acted like a man to his wife. He always seemed several degrees
lower than a snake. I loved her and I could not go on seeing her leading that life. I
did not intend to kill him. I only meant to injure him. I gave him an opportunity
of standing up to me as a man but he wouldn’t. I have had the knife some time; it

was a sheath knife. I threw it down a drain when I was running through Endsleigh
Gardens.
Examination of Richard Sellars, Continued
Later the two prisoners were charged with the murder of Percy Thompson. When
the charge was made Thompson made no reply, while Bywaters said, “It is wrong,
it is wrong.” On 12th October I received a ditty box (exhibit No. 8), from Sergeant
James.TheprisonerBywatersgavemethekeywhichopenedthebox.Ireceivedfrom
Inspector Page, of New Scotland Yard, and also from Sergeant Hancock a number
of letters. Inspector Hall also handed to me three letters written by Bywaters. I have
seen Bywaters write, and to the best of my belief exhibits Nos. 14, 30, and 31 are in
his handwriting.
Cross-examined by Mr. Cecil Whiteley – Bywaters was taken to the Ilford
police station on the evening of 4th October.
Were you in sole charge of this case, or was there any other ofﬁcer concerned? –
Superintendent Wensley came down, but I was practically in sole charge of it. He
was not present with me at every interview I had with Bywaters. He was present
with me when Bywaters gave the long statement (exhibit No. 5). He was not present
when I took the statement No. 6. When Bywaters was brought to the station in the
evening of the 4th Superintendent Wensley and I were there, and we both saw him.
We were in the company of Bywaters that evening for about an hour and a half.
Practically the whole of that period was occupied by the taking of the statement.
There was a typist present in the room.
You do not suggest that this was a statement dictated by Bywaters? – Practically.
He wished to make a statement, and I said we would take it down in writing.
No questions asked? – Yes.
Is it not clear from the statement itself that questions were put to him and
his answers are incorporated in that statement? – Not wholly, practically. Both
Superintendent Wensley and I asked the questions. We left Bywaters about nine
o’clock. I do not think either of us saw him again that evening; I do not remember
seeinghim.Ibelievehesleptinthelibrarythatevening.Onthenextday,5thOctober,
about 3 p.m., I took a statement from Mrs. Thompson (exhibit No. 3). The second
statement of Mrs. Thompson (exhibit No. 4) was taken about half-past four or
quarter to ﬁve.
Was it before those two statements that Mrs. Thompson saw Bywaters and said,
“Why did he do it; I did not want him to do it”? – Yes, after she was returning from
the room where she was taken. Superintendent Wensley was not present when she
said that. No steps were taken by the police to prevent Mrs. Thompson and Bywaters
seeing each other.
It was after Mrs. Thompson had seen Bywaters, and after she had made the
statement (exhibit No. 4) that you went back into Bywaters’ room and the statement
(exhibit No. 6) was taken? – Yes. I wrote it down myself. Before that statement was
taken I told him that I was going to charge him and Mrs. Thompson with this crime.

By Mr. Justice Shearman – Did you know by that time that he had seen
that she was there too? – Yes.
You told us that she caught sight of him, but nobody has told us that he caught
sight of her. Do you know if he did? – I could not say, because my attention was
centred on her.
Cross-examination continued – I certainly think that Bywaters did see Mrs.
Thompson, but I cannot say positively.
No doubt they had seen one another, and the very ﬁrst thing he said, directly you
said that both of them were going to be charged, was, “Why her? Mrs. Thompson
was not aware of my movements”? – Yes.
And when you charged them both together that evening Bywaters said, “It is
wrong; it is wrong”? – Yes.
Cross-examined by Sir H. Curtis Bennett – I ﬁrst of all saw Mrs. Thompson
at11a.m.on4thOctober,themorningthatMr.Thompsondied,andatthattimeshe
madeastatementwhichInotedinmynotebook.Atthattimeshehadnoknowledge,
as far as I know, that any inquiries were being made as regards Bywaters. She did not
say anything about anybody having knocked her or pushed her aside. After making
that statement I asked her to come to the police ofﬁce, and she was kept there from
twelve o’clock on the 4th until the afternoon of the 5th, when I took from her the
long statement (exhibit No. 3).
At that time, as far as you know, she had no knowledge that Bywaters was at the
station? – I could not say, but I should not think so.
Nobody had told her as far as you know? – No, but I gleaned that she did on
account of the letters.
What? – I gleaned that she did on account of the letters. The letters were on
the table where we took the statement, and she must have known on account of
Bywaters’s letters.
By Mr. Justice Shearman – She identiﬁed her own letters to Bywaters.
Cross-examination continued – She identiﬁed them in the statement (exhibit
No. 3). That statement took about an hour and a half. After the statement was taken
she had to pass the room where Bywaters was being detained in order to get to the
matron’s room.
Directly she saw Bywaters there she said this, “Oh, God, oh, God, what can I
do? Why did he do it? I did not want him to do it”; and then almost immediately
afterwards, “I must tell the truth”? – Yes.
And then it was that, having said “I must tell the truth,” you cautioned her,
and then she said, “When we got near Endsleigh Gardens a man rushed out from
the gardens and knocked me away, pushed me away, from my husband. When I
recovered I saw my husband scufﬂing with a man. The man, who I knew as Freddie
Bywaters, was running away. He was wearing a blue overcoat and a grey hat. I knew
it was him, although I did not see his face.” That is right? – Correct.
So that directly she had in fact seen Bywaters was at the station she made this
second statement? – Yes.

Analysis of Evidence
Examination of Leonard Williams
Leonard Williams, examined by Mr. Roland Oliver – I am a detective of
K Division. On 6th October I took the prisoner Bywaters and certain property from
Ilford to Stratford Police Court. When at the Court he said, pointing to the property,
“Have you a knife there?” I said, “No.” He said, “Have they found it?” I said, “I do
not think so.” He said, “I told them I ran up Endsleigh Gardens, but coming to
think of it after I did it I ran forward along Belgrave Road towards Wanstead Park,
turning up a road to the right. I am not sure whether it was Kensington Gardens
where they lived or the next road. I then crossed over to the left side of the road, and
just before I got to the top of Cranbrook Road end I put the knife down a drain; it
should be easily found.”
Concluding Remarks
The Solicitor General – That will be the case for the Crown.
[The letters, exhibits Nos. 49, 12, 62, 27, 13, 15, 16, 20, 50, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 51,
23, 66, 67, 68, 24, 53, 25, 69, 26, 52, 63, 54, 28, 55, 47, 48, 58, 59, 9, 60, 10, 64, 14,
30, 31, were read.]
Sir H. Curtis Bennett – The jury, of course, will understand that in addition
to those letters there are 33 other ones on which the prosecution do not rely and
which are not put in.
[At the conclusion of the case for the Crown, a selection of Edith Thompson’s
letters to Bywaters and three letters from him to Thompson were read out in open
court by Travers Humphreys, one of the junior counsel for the Crown. It is said that
his reading of the letters was “not unsympathetic.”]

Darlingest, – Will you please take these letters back now? I have nowhere to keep
them, except a small cash box, I have just bought and I want that for my own letters

only and I feel scared to death in case anybody else should read them. All the wishes
I can possibly send for the very best of luck to-day,
From Peidi.

Envelope – Unaddressed.
Have told you before I put 10/- eh way on ‘Welsh Woman’ for the M’chester Cup,
just because you liked it. I expect you know the result. The favourite won and it (the
favourite) was the only horse I really fancied, but as it was only 5 to 2 starting price,
I didn’t think it was worth the risk and then the dashed thing won.
Darlint, its a good job you are winning some money at cards, for I can’t win any
at horses.
I have won 14/9 on one race since you have been gone, I’ve forgotten which one
it was.
I’ve enclosed you several cuttings, please read them darlint, and tell me what you
think of them. The one I’ve marked with a cross I think very true indeed, but I’d
like to know what you think about it.
The part about ‘a man to lean on’ is especially true. Darlint, it was that about you
that ﬁrst made me think of you, in the way I do now. I feel always that were I in any
difﬁculty, I could rely and lean on you. I like to feel that I have you to lean on, of
courseIdontwanttoreallybutitsnicetoknowIcan,ifIwantto.Doyouunderstand?
Note the part, ‘always think of her ﬁrst, always be patient and kind, always help her
in every way he can, he will have gone a long way to making her love him.’
Such things as wiping up, getting pins for me etc, all counted, darlint. Do you
remember the pin incident, on Aug. 1, darlint and the subsequent remark from
him ‘You like to have someone always tacked on to you to run all your little errands
and obey all your little requests.’ That was it, darlint, that counted, obeying little
requests – such as getting a pin, it was a novelty – he’d never done that . . .
‘It is the man who has no right, who generally comforts the woman who has
wrongs.’ This is also right darlint isn’t it? as things are, but darlint, its not always
going to be is it? You will have the right soon wont you? Say Yes. . .
The last 2 Fridays I have been to the Waldorf and on the ﬁrst occasion it was
very foggy – all the trains were late, so had a taxi right to the avenue and got to
Mother’s at 10.20. He wasnt coming for me so I didnt matter much – but I expect
they wonder what I do. I have promised to go to the ‘Cafe Marguerite’ to dinner
tonight. Can you guess with whom? God knows why I said Id go, I dont want to a bit
especially with him, but it will help to pass some time away, it goes slowly enough
in all conscience – I dont seem to care who spends the money, as long as it helps me
to dance through the hours. I had the wrong Porridge today, but I dont suppose it
will matter, I dont seem to care much either way. You’ll probably say I’m careless
and I admit I am, but I dont care – do you? I gave way this week (to him I mean,) its
the ﬁrst time since you have been gone. Why do I tell you this? I dont really know
myself, I didnt when you were away before, but it seems different this time, then

I was looking forward – but now well I can only go from day to day and week to
week until Jan. 7th – then thoughts and all things stop. How have you got on with
‘The Guarded Flame.’ I expect by now you have it interesting –. I have persevered
with ‘Felix’ and have nearly ﬁnished it. Its weird – horrible and ﬁlthy – yet I am
very interested. You’ll have to read it after I have ﬁnished. I believe if I read this
letter through before I sealed it you’d not receive it darlint, I feel that Id tear it up,
it doesn’t seem to me that Ive been talking to you at all – just writing to you, but I
feel like that today, and I know its rotten because you get this letter for Xmas and it
wont be a very nice present will it darlint, but its the best I can do. Perhaps I’ll leave
this letter open and see how I feel by Wednesday, the last day for posting it.
Darlint, Monday – I recd greetings from you and a note ‘I cant write to you’ and
Ive been expecting to talk to you for a long time I wanted to I wanted you to cheer
me up – I feel awful – but I know darlint if you cant well you cant – that’s all to be
said about it, but I always feel I cant talk to you when I start, but I just say to myself
he’s here with me, looking at me and listening to what I am saying and it seems to
help darlint, couldnt you try and do this, I feel awfully sad and lonely and think how
much you would be cheering me up but perhaps you’ll think I’m selﬁsh about it all
and I suppose I am, but remember when you are thinking badly or hardly of me
your letters are the only thing I have in the world and darlint, I havnt even all those.
We had – was it a row – anyway a very heated argument again last night (Sunday).
It started through the usual source, I resisted – and he wanted to know why since
you went in August I was different – ‘had I transferred my affections from him
to you.’ Darlint it’s a great temptation to say ‘Yes’ but I did not. He said we were
cunning, the pair of us and lots of other things that I forget, also that I told lies
about not knowing you were coming on that Sat. He said ‘Has he written to you
since he has been away,’ and when I said ‘No’ he said ‘That’s another lie.’ Of course
he cant know for certain, but he surmises you do and Im afraid he’ll ring up and ask
them to stop anything that comes for me so I must get Jim on my side. You know
darlint I am beginning to think I have gone wrong in the way I manage this affair.
I think perhaps it would have been better had I acquiesced in everything he said
and did or wanted to do. At least it would have disarmed any suspicion he might
have and that would have been better if we have to use drastic measures darlint –
understand? Anyway so much for him. I’ll talk about someone else . . .
Goodbye for now darlint, I’ll try and be more cheerful when I write to Marseilles.
You say ‘Dont worry’– just dance – If I only could.
PEIDI.

slating you all this trip for not talking to me and I get all those letters from Marseilles

Analysis of Evidence
darlint, I love them and don’t take any notice of me, I know I am selﬁsh – and you
ought to know by now, I told you haven’t I ? heaps of times. Now what have I got
to talk to you about, heaps of things I believe – but the most important thing is,
that I love you and am feeling so happy that you are coming back to England, even
tho perhaps I am not going to see you – you know best about that darlint, and I am
going to leave everything to you – only I would like to help you, can’t I. Of course
he knows you are due in on the 7th and will be very suspicious of me from then,
so I suppose I won’t be able to see you – will I? You know darlint, don’t have the
slightest worrying thoughts about letters as “to be careful I’ve been cruel” to myself
I mean.
Immediately I have received a second letter, I have destroyed the ﬁrst and when I
got the third I destroyed the second and so on, now the only one I have is the “Dear
Edie” one written to 41, which I am going to keep. It may be useful, who knows?
By the way I had a New Year’s card, addressed to me only from “Osborne House,
Shanklin.”
About the 15th darlint, which will be the 14th as that is the Sat: I am going – as
far as I know, I have to book the seats this week.
Darlint, I’ve surrendered to him unconditionally now – do you understand me?
I think it the best way to disarm any suspicion, in fact he has several times asked me
if I am happy now and I’ve said “Yes quite” but you know that’s not the truth, dont
you.
About the photos darlint, I have not seen them, so I don’t understand about
“waiting for you” please destroy all you don’t want and when you come to England,
show me what I look like, will you yes, I was glad you promised for me, darlint,
as I most certainly should have refused myself and I should have hated myself for
refusing all the time. Darlint, I never want to refuse you anything, its lovely for me
to feel like that about you, I think by this you can understand how much I love you.
The French phrase darlint, if I can remember rightly was “I cant wait so long, I
want time to go faster.”
You used iron and I used my heel and its such a long time ago, or seems so, since
I asked a question, to which your “I did that” is the answer, that, I have forgotten
what my question was. Yes, darlint I did wonder about you and the “Cale” and was
nursing all to myself quite an aggrieved feeling against you for not telling me, but
your letter explained. I feel glad you didn’t transfer, darlint Ive got no special reason
for feeling glad – but I am. About the fortune teller – you have never mentioned
“March” before darlint, you’ve said “Early in the New Year,” are you gradually sliding
up the year to keep my spirits up? darlint, I hope not I’d sooner be sad for ever and
know the truth, than have that expectant feeling of buoyancy for a myth.
Darlint I’ll do and say all and everything you tell me to, about friend, only
remember not to do anything that will leave me behind by myself.
About the Stewardess, Im glad you went to the cabin with her, what is it I feel and
thinkaboutyou?Ihavesomeone toleanon–ifIneedanyone,andshehadtoodarlint,
hadn’t she? someone to lean on and help her, even against her own inclinations.

I know I am right? Darlint, I didnt think it fair about the ﬁght altho most
people are disgusted with boxing (women I mean) I always tried to look upon it as
something strong and big and when you told me about that I thought. If amateurs
even do that sort of thing, then professionals must and I felt disappointed.
Thanking you for those greetings darlint, but you wont always be “The man with
no right” will you – tell me you wont – shout at me – make me hear and believe
darlint, about that “Do you” I believe I felt about the worst I have ever felt when that
happened I think when I noticed what I had done I had a conscience prick and felt
“I dont care what happens and I dont suppose he does really” but you would care
wouldnt you darlint? tell me yes, if I really thought you wouldnt darlint I shouldnt
want to die, I just want to go mad.
Why have you never told me what you thought of your own photos darlint, you
are a bad bad correspondent really darlint I absolutely refuse to talk to you at all
next trip, if you dont mend your ways. Darlint, are you frightened at this – just
laugh at me. . .

Exhibit 15:
Envelope – Mr. F. Bywaters, P. & O. R.M.S. “Morea,” Aden.
[Postmark – London, 10th Feb. 22, 2.30 p.m.]
Darlint – You must do something this time – I’m not really impatient – but oppor-
tunities come and go by – they have to – because I’m helpless and I think and think
and think – perhaps – it will never come again.
I want to tell you about this. On Wednesday we had words – in bed – Oh you
know darlint – over that same old subject and he said – it was all through you I’d
altered.
I told him if he ever again blamed you to me for any difference there might be
in me, I’d leave the house that minute and this is not an idle threat.
He said lots of other things and I bit my lip – so that I shouldn’t answer –
eventually went to sleep. About 2 A.M. he woke me up and asked for water as he
felt ill. I got it for him and asked him what the matter was and this is what he told
me – whether its the truth I dont know or whether he did it to frighten me, anyway
it didnt. He said – someone he knows in town (not the man I previously told you
about) had given him a prescription for a draught for insomnia and he’d had it
made up and taken it and it made him ill. He certainly looked ill and his eyes were
glassy. I’ve hunted for the said prescription everywhere and cant ﬁnd it and asked
him what he had done with it and he said the chemist kept it.
I told Avis about the incident only I told her as if it frightened and worried me as
I thought perhaps it might be useful at some future time that I had told somebody.
What do you think, darlint. His sister Maggie came in last night and he told her,
so now there are two witnesses, altho’ I wish he hadn’t told her – but left me to do it.
It would be so easy darlint – if I had things – I do hope I shall.
How about cigarettes?

Analysis of Evidence
Have enclosed cuttings of Dr. Wallis’s case. It might prove interesting darlint, I
want to have you only I love you so much try and help me PEIDI.
Exhibit 15a:
Extract from Daily Sketch, 9th February, 1922, page 2, column 1.
With headnote: –
“Curate’s Household of Three.
“Mystery of his Death still unsolved.
“Wife and Doctor.
“Woman asked to leave the Court during man’s evidence.”
“Death from hyoscine poisoning, but how it was administered there is not suf-
ﬁcient evidence to show.”
This was the verdict last night at an inquest at Lingﬁeld after remarkable evidence
and searching cross-examination.
The three principal ﬁgures in the case are –
TheRev.HoraceGeorgeBolding(39),curateofLingﬁeld(Surrey)ParishChurch,
found dead on his bed in his dressing-gown on January 4. Described by parishioners
as “Happy, jovial, one of the best of good fellows, and a regular sport.”
Mrs. Bolding, about 35, the widow, who was in London with the only child, a
boy, at the time of her husband’s death.
Dr. Preston Wallis, a ship’s surgeon, who, separated from his wife, had stayed
some time with the Boldings, and who was called to the bedroom and found the
curate dead.
On page 15, column 3, the report is concluded with the following headnote: –
“Helping the Doctor.
“Why Curate’s wife often went about in his Chair.
“Practice that dwindled.”

I think I’ll tell you about the holidays darlint – just what I did – do you want to
know? or will you say its all ordinary common place talk – I suppose it is – but after I
have discussed the ordinary things, I may be able to really talk to you. On Thursday
we left at 1 and I went to the Waldorf to lunch and stayed on until the dance tea – I
only danced once – a fox trot – I don’t feel a bit like dancing darlint – I think I must
be waiting for you. We left the Waldorf at 6.20 and met Avis at 6.30 and went with
her to buy a costume – getting home about 9.
On Friday I worked hard all day starting that “Good Old fashioned English
housewife’s occupation of spring cleaning,” not because I liked doing it – or believe

in it, but because I had nothing else to do and it helped to pass the time away. I
started about 9.30 and went to wash and dress about 20 to 6 – .
Dad took us to the E.H. Palace to the Sunday League Concert in the evening and
we stopped the night at 231.
In return for this I booked for us all at Ilford Hippodrome on Saturday. The
show was good and a girl – in nurses uniform appearing with Tom Edwards sang
“He makes me all fussed up.”
Of course Avis remarked about you and the song also Molly was sitting behind
us with another girl and a boy – is she affected in her conversation? She was very
much on Saturday and I wondered if it was put on for my special beneﬁt.
Avis came back to stay the rest of the holiday with us. Bye the way, we, (she and
I) had a cup of tea in bed on Sunday – we always do when she is stopping with us.
Mother and Dad came over to me to dinner – I had plenty to do. On Monday Mr.
and Mrs. Birnage came to tea and we all went to the Hippodrome in the evening.
Bye the way – what is “Aromatic Tincture of Opium” – Avis drew my attention to a
bottle of this sealed in the medicine chest in your room.4
I took possession of it and when he missed it and asked me for it – I refused to
give it him – he refuses to tell me where he got it and for what reason he wants it –
so I shall keep it till I hear from you.
I used the “light bulb” three times but the third time – he found a piece – so I’ve
given it up – until you come home.
Do you remember asking me to get a duplicate of something – . I have done so
now.
On Sunday we were arguing about the price of “Cuticura.” Avis is quite certain
when she bought it, not for herself, (her owns words) it was 10 1/2. Mother said
when she bought it for you it was 1/- and I said the same.
The remark was passed – “you all in turn seemed to have bought it for him.”. . .

Darlingest Boy I know,
If you were to hear me talk now you would laugh, I’m quite positive and I should
be angry – I’ve got practically no voice at all – just a little very high up, squeak.
It started with a very sore throat and then my voice went – it doesn’t hurt now –
the throat is better but it sounds so funny. I feel like laughing myself but altho you’d
laugh darlint you’d be very kind wouldn’t you? and just take care of me. I know you
would without asking or you answering – but you can answer because I like to hear
you say it.
About those fainting ﬁts darlint, I don’t really know what to say to you.

Analysis of Evidence
I’m beginning to think it’s the same as before – they always happen 1st thing in
the morning – when I’m getting up and I wasn’t ill as I should have been last time,
altho’ I was a little – but not as usual.
What shall I do about it darlint, if it is the same this month – please write and
tell me I want to do just what you would like.
I still have the herbs.
“I like her she doesn’t swear.”
This is what you write – do you like her because she doesn’t swear or was that
bit an afterthought. I’m wondering what you really think of a girl – any girl – even
me who says – damn and a few stronger words sometimes – or don’t these words
constitute swearing as you hear it.
Of course I was glad you did as you did with her. I should never be glad at any
other way darlint, whatever the object or the end in view.
Talking about “Felix” darlint can’t say I was disappointed in the end because I
didn’t expect very much of him. You say you expected him to do a lot for Valevia –
I didn’t – he was too ordinary – too prosaic to do anything sensational – he’d do
anything in the world for her if it hadn’t caused comment but when it did – he
ﬁnished. Do you remember the railway station scene when her husband appeared,
and took command of the proceedings. Felix was nowhere and he allowed himself
not only to go home, but to be ordered to go home by Mr. Ismay. What were your
feelings for Mr. Ismay – did you like him? About the word you starred – I can’t say
I actually know the meaning of the word only of course I guess but you can tell me
darlint I certainly shan’t ask anyone else.
Darlint isn’t this a mistake “Je suis gache, ma pauvre petite amie.” This is how
you wrote it.
I was glad you think and feel the same way as I do about the “New Forest.” I
don’t think we’re failures in other things and we musn’t be in this. We musn’t give
up as we said. No, we shall have to wait if we fail again. Darlint, Fate can’t always
turn against us and if it is we must ﬁght it – You and I are strong now We must be
stronger. We must learn to be patient. We must have each other darlint. Its meant
to be I know I feel it is because I love you such a lot – such a love was not meant to
be in vain. It will come right I know one day, if not by our efforts some other way.
We’ll wait eh darlint, and you’ll try and get some money and then we can go away
and not worry about anybody or anything. You said it was enough for an elephant.
Perhaps it was. But you don’t allow for the taste making only a small quantity to be
taken. It sounded like a reproach was it meant to be?
Darlint I tried hard – you won’t know how hard – because you weren’t there
to see and I can’t tell you all – but I did – I do want you to believe I did for both
of us.
You will see by my last letter to you I havn’t forgotten the key and I didn’t want
reminding – I didn’t forget that – altho’ I did forget something last time didn’t I
altho it was only small.

We have changed our plans about Llandudno – it is too expensive we are going
to Bournemouth July 8th, and while Avis was over last night he asked her to come
with us. The suggestion was nothing to do with me – it was his entirely and altho’
I wouldn’t have suggested such a thing for the world – I’m glad – because if things
are still the same and we do go – a third party helps to make you forget that you
always lead the existence we do.
Au revoir for the week end darlint.
The mail was in this morning and I read your letter darlint, I cried – I couldn’t
help it – such a lot it sounded so sad I cried for you I could exactly feel how you
were feeling – I’ve felt like that so often and I know.
I was buoyed up with the hope of the “light bulb” and I used a lot – big pieces
too – not powdered – and it has no effect – I quite expected to be able to send that
cable – but no – nothing has happened from it and now your letter tells me about
the bitter taste again. Oh darlint, I do feel so down and unhappy.
Wouldn’t the stuff make small pills coated together with soap and dipped in
liquorice powder – like Beechams – try while you’re away. Our Boy had to have his
thumb operated on because he had a piece of glass in it that’s what made me try
that method again – but I suppose as you say he is not normal, I know I feel I shall
never get him to take a sufﬁcient quantity of anything bitter. No I haven’t forgotten
the key I told you before.
Darlint two heads are better than one is such a true saying. You tell me not to leave
ﬁnger marks on the box – do you know I did not think of the box but I did think of
the glass or cup whatever was used. I wish I wish oh I wish I could do something.
Darlint, think for me, do. I do want to help. If you only knew how helpless and
selﬁsh I feel letting you do such a lot for me and I doing nothing for you. If ever we
are lucky enough to be happy darling I’ll love you such a lot. I always show you how
much I love you for all you do for me. Its a terrible feeling darlint to want – really
want to give all and everything, and not be able to give a tiny little thing – just thro’
circumstances.
You asked me if Deborah described her feelings rightly when she was talking
about Kullett making love to her.
Darlingest, boy, I don’t think all the feelings can be put on paper because there
are not words to describe them. The feeling is one of repugnance, loathing not
only of the person but of yourself – and darlint when you think of a man and a
woman jointly wrote that book it’s not feasible that the words used would be bad
enough to express the feelings. The man Author wouldn’t allow the woman Author
to talk too badly of Kullett – do you think? I still think that nobody can express
the feelings – I’m sure I couldn’t – but they are there, deeply rooted and can never
be plucked out as circumstances now are unless they (the circumstances) change.
Did you notice any similarity in 2 girls names in two books that you recently read

and the utter dissimilarity in their natures (I don’t think I spelt that word rightly)
I didn’t know that you would be in London a month this time – altho I had a little
idea.
That month – I can’t bear to think of it a whole four weeks and things the same
as they are now. All those days to live thro for just one hour in each.
All that lying and scheming and subterfuge to obtain one little hour in each
day – when by right of nature and our love we should be together for all the 24 in
every day.
Darlint don’t let it be – I can’t bear it all this time – the pain gets too heavy to
bear – heavier each day – but if things were different what a grand life we should
start together. Perhaps we could have that one week I could be ill from shock – More
lies – but the last. Eh darlint.
Do experiment with the pills while you are away – please darlint.
No we two – two halves – have not yet come to the end of our tether.
Don’t let us.
I’m sorry I’ve had to use this piece of paper but the pad was empty – I sent the
boy for a fresh one and they will have none in until tomorrow.
We have started on the 5th week of your absence now – each week seems longer
than the last and each day the length of two.
Do you know darlint that the Saturday I usually have off when you are home is
Whit Saturday and I shan’t be able to see you nor on the Monday following.
Three whole days – and you so near and yet so far – it musn’t be darlint – we
musn’t let it somehow.
Good bye now darlint I can’t write any more. You said you have a lump – so have
I in fact its more than a lump now.
Good bye until Marseilles next week. I do always love you and think of you.
PEIDI.

About the Marconigram – do you mean one saying Yes or No, because I shant
send it darlint I’m not going to try any more until you come back.
I made up my mind about this last Thursday.
He was telling his Mother etc. the circumstances of my “Sunday morning
escapade” and he puts great stress on the fact of the tea tasting bitter “as if something
had been put in it” he says. Now I think whatever else I try it in again will still taste
bitter – he will recognise it and be more suspicious still and if the quantity is still
not successful – it will injure any chance I may have of trying when you come home.
Do you understand?
I thought a lot about what you said of Dan.

Darlint, don’t trust him – I don’t mean don’t tell him anything because I know
you never would – What I mean is don’t let him be suspicious of you regarding
that – because if we were successful in the action – darlint circumstances may

Darlingest Boy,
I’m trying very hard – very very hard to B.B. I know my pal wants me to.
On Thursday – he was on the ottoman at the foot of the bed and said he was
dying and wanted to – he had another heart attack – thro me.
Darlint I had to laugh at this because I knew it couldn’t be a heart attack.
When he saw this had no effect on me – he got up and stormed – I said exactly
what you told me to and he replied that he knew thats what I wanted and he wasnt
going to give it to me – it would make things far too easy for both of you (meaning
you and me) especially for you he said.
He said hed been to 231 and been told you had said you were taking a pal out
and it was all a planned affair so was the last Thursday you were home and also
Tuesday of last week at Fenchurch Street – he told them at 231 a pal of his saw us
and by the description he gave of the man I was with it was you.

Analysis of Evidence
That’s an awful lie darlint because I told him I went to F St. for Mr. Carlton and
saw Booth and spoke to him and I asked him the next day if Booth mentioned me
and he said no – nothing at all.
We’re both liars he says and you are making me worse and he’s going to put a
stop to all or any correspondence coming for me at 168. He said “It’s useless for
you to deny he writes to you – because I know he does” – hence my wire to you
regarding G.P.O.
He also says I told him I wrote to you asking you not to see me this time – he
knows very well I said last time – but I think he has really persuaded himself I said
this time.
I rang Avis yesterday and she said he came down there in a rage and told Dad
everything – about all the rows we have had over you – but she did not mention
he said anything about the ﬁrst real one on August 1st – so I suppose he kept that
back to suit his own ends Dad said it was a disgraceful thing that you should come
between husband and wife and I ought to be ashamed. Darlint I told you this is how
they would look at it – they don’t understand and they never will any of them.
Dad was going to talk to me Avis said – but I went down and nothing whatever
was said by any of them. I told Avis I shd tell them off if they said anything to me I
didn’t go whining to my people when he did things I didn’t approve of and I didnt
expect him to – but however nothing was said at all.
Dad said to them “What a scandal if it should get in the papers” so evidently he
suggested drastic measures to them.
On Friday night I said I was going to sleep in the little room – we had a scufﬂe –
he succeeded in getting into the little room and on to the bed – so I went into the
bathroom and stopped there for 1/2 an hr – he went downstairs then and I went into
the little room quickly – locked the door and stopped there all night – I shd have
continued to do so – but even a little thing like that Fate was against us – because
Dad was over on Sat. and asked me if he could stay the night – suggested he should
sleep with him in the big bed – but Dad would not hear of it – so sooner than make
another fuss – I gave in.
On Saturday he told me he was going to break me in somehow – I have always
had too much of my own way and he was a model husband – and in future on
Thursdays the bedroom was to be cleaned out.
He also told me he was going to be master and I was to be his mistress and not
half a dozen mens (his words) I dont exactly know how to take this – Darlint, do
you know Avis said to me – Miss M’Donald saw you with Freddy last week – of
course I denied it – but she described my frock – anyhow it turned out to be on
Wed. – so of course it was all right – but you see – we are seen and by people who
know us and cant hold their tongues Avis said she was upset because you had gone
for good – she said she could hardly realise it. She also said that he said at 231 “I
thought he was keen on you (Avis) – but now I can see it was a blind to cover his
infatuation for Edie.”
Darlint its not an infatuation is it? Tell me it isn’t.

I don’t think theres anything else heaps of little things were said that I cant
remember but you can judge what they were – because you know me and him.
Im writing a letter to Marseilles darlint – this is only a summary of events.

Darlint Pal,
[First paragraphs omitted.]
I wonder how my own pal is feeling – I’m feeling very blue myself – an inactive
sort of drifting feeling, that can’t be described – I suppose its really reaction – I
longing to hear from you next Monday – I hope its a lot.
On our birthday you will be left Aden on your way to Bombay – you’ll be thinking
of a girl whose best pal you are in England wont you – I’ll think of you – all day
every little minute – and keep on wishing you success as I cant be – Perhaps you
can and as you say you are still hoping darlint – so shall I. Time hangs so dreadfully
and just because I want to work it away we are not busy this week and are leaving at
ﬁve. I suppose we shall thro the Summer now. Darlint, how can you get ptomaine
poisoning from a tin of salmon? One of our boys Mother has died with it after being
ill only three days.
One year ago today we went for that memorable ride round the island in the
char-a-bancdoyouremember?LastnightwhenIwenttobedIkissedyougoodnight
in my mind because that was the ﬁrst time you kissed me.
Darlint this month and next are full of remembrances – arnt they?
I went to 49 last night and sat and listened to ailments for about 2 hours – its
awfully exhilarating especially when you feel blue. I also had a small row with them.
He asked why Graham never came to see us and I said “Why do you ask for him to
come round when you know he’s not allowed to.”
This led to words of course and I was told that neither his mother nor his Father
would tell him not to speak to me – my retort was that I knew his Father would not
but It would take more than any of them to convince me his mother would not, and
I wish to God I didnt have to go there – I feel really bad tempered when I come away.
I was taken faint in the train this morning – I didnt quite go off though – On
Saturday I’m going to see a Doctor, I think it is best that I should – I dont like doing
these silly things in public places – I’ve got my costume home – it looks very nice –
Im ever so pleased with it – but I dont want to wear it – I wish you would see me in
it – what would you like me to do? Next week I’ll be writing to the other end of the
world to you darlint – I wish you didnt ever have to leave England, even if I didnt
see you I should feel happier and safe because you would be near – but the sea and
Australia sounds years and years apart, I do so much want my pal to talk to and
conﬁde in and my own man to lean upon sometimes . . .
always,
PEIDI.

Darlingest Boy I know,
This time last year I had won the sweep stake for the Gold Cup, this year I have
lost £1: 10/- eh way Kings Idler and the result is Golden Myth at 7 to 1, Flamboyant
20 to 1, and Ballyheron 8 to 1. I’m not going to bet any more – even in horse racing
the fates are against me.
You get into Marseilles tonight I wonder how you’re feeling darlint, very blue –
or not feeling anything at all – just drifting – its hard either way isn’t it?
I wish you had taken me with you darlint – I don’t think I will be able to stay on
here all alone – there seems so much to contend with – so long to “dance” when
you’d rather die and all for no deﬁnite purpose. Oh I’ll pack up now, I can’t talk
cheerfully – so I shan’t talk at all goodnight darlint.
It’s Friday now, darlint nearly time to go, I am wondering if you remember what
your answer was to me in reply to my “What’s the matter” tonight of last year.
I remember quite well – “You know what’s the matter, I love you” . . . but you
didn’t then darlint, because you do now and its different now, isn’t it? From then
onwards everything has gone wrong with our lives – I don’t mean to say it was right
before – at least mine wasn’t right – but I was quite indifferent to it being either
right or wrong and you darlint – you hadn’t any of the troubles – or the worries
you have now – you were quite free in mind and body – and now through me you
are not – darlint I am sorry I shouldn’t mind if I could feel that some day I should
be able to make up to you for all the unhappiness I have caused in your life – but I
can’t feel that darlint – I keep on saying to myself that “it will – it shall come right” –
but there is no conviction behind it – why can’t we see into the future?
When you are not near darlint I wish we had taken the easiest way – I suppose it
is because I can’t see you – can’t have you to hold me and talk to me – because when
you are in England I always want to go on trying and trying and not to give up –
to see and feel you holding me – is to hope on, and when I can’t have that I feel a
coward. The days pass – no they don’t pass, they just drag on and on and the end of
all this misery and unhappiness is no nearer in sight – is anything worth living for?
There are 2 halves in this world who want nothing on earth but to be joined
together and circumstances persistently keep them apart – nothing is fair – nothing
is just – we can’t even live for ourselves – can we?
I suppose the week end will pass somehow – the only thought that helps is that
you will talk to me on Monday.
Goodbye darlingest boy – I do wish you were here.
Its Monday now darlint, that day you came up and took me to lunch at the Kings
Hall do you remember?

Things are very quiet here and Mr. Carlton has taken 2 or 3 days off this week.
He told me he would come up about Thursday – to ﬁx up the outing on Saturday –
that was the day last year that you and Avis came to an understanding – I wonder
if that’s the right way to put it.
Nothing happened over the week end darlint except that Dad came up on
Saturday and did not go home in the evening. It’s becoming a regular thing now –
I wonder why?
When you are in Australia – darlint you will tell me all you do and where you
go – everything – I want to know.
I shall be in Bournemouth when you’re in Australia think about me darlingest
boy – it won’t be the holiday I anticipated will it? I certainly shant learn to swim
neither shall I be playing tennis it won’t be nice at all – because I shan’t even be
able to escape things and beings by going up to town each day – but it’s one of
those things that have to be gone thro in this life I lead and all the railings against
it won’t alter a tiny bit of it – so I must dance thro somehow. Are you going to see
Harold? if you do, try and knock a bit of sense into him please darlint pour moi and
write and tell me what he is doing, – how is he getting on – everything – he writes
such nonsense that you can’t tell from a letter what he really is doing. He’s written
to Doris Grafton and tells her, he is sending over her passage money and she is to
come out and marry him – and a lot more of rot like that – darlint I’m sure he’s not
normal sometimes.
See what my pal can do for me, please.
Won’t you have a long time to wait for a letter from me this time, Darlint? I have
been looking at the mail card and see you do not arrive in Australia until July 22nd –
I’m so sorry – I wish I could afford to cable you a long long letter to somewhere
before Sydney, or better still, to be able to phone to you and hear you say “Is that
Peidi?”
I went to see a doctor on Saturday he asked me lots of questions – could he
examine me etc – I said no – then he said are you enciente? to which I replied “No,
I think not,” but explained to him how I felt. Eventually he came to the conclusion
that I have “chronic anaemia” – which will probably turn to pernicious anaemia if
I am not careful.
I asked him exactly what this was and he said, “all your blood every drop turns
to water.”
I also asked him if it was a usual thing for any one to have and he said “No” only
much older people suffer with it; as a rule – only younger people, when they have
had an accident and lost a lot of blood, have you had one? he said.
I said “No” – because it wasn’t really an accident and I didn’t want to tell him
everything – he might have wanted to see my husband.
But I expect thats what has really caused this anaemia – because I lost an awful
lot of blood.

Analysis of Evidence
The doctor says I must drink Burgundy with every meal – 4 glasses a day – I don’t
know how I am going to do that – I hate the stuff.
He has given me some medicine as well and a box of pills to be taken until I am ill.
Darlint are you disappointed it is only that? tell me please.
I’ve just come back from getting the Marseilles Mail at the G.P.O.
What an utterly absurd thing to say to me “Don’t be too disappointed.”
You can’t possibly know what it feels like to want and wait each day – every little
hour – for something – something that means “life” to you and then not to get it.
You told me from Dover that you were going to talk to me for a long time at
Marseilles and now you put it off to Port Said.
You force me to conclude that the life you lead away from England – is all
absorbing that you havn’t time nor inclination to remember England or anything
England holds.
There were at least 5 days you could have talked to me about – if you only spared
me 5 minutes out of each day. But what is the use of me saying all this – it’s the
same always – I’m never meant to have anything I expect or want. If I am unjust – I
am sorry – but I can’t feel anything at present – only just as if I have had a blow on
the head and I am stunned – the disappointment – no, more than that – the utter
despair is too much to bear – I would sooner go under today than anything.
All I can hope is, that you will never never feel like I do today – it’s so easy to write
“try to be brave” its so much harder to be so, nobody knows – but those who try to
be – against such heavy odds.
It’s more to me than anything on this earth – to read what you say to me – you
know this darlint, why do you fail me? What encouragement is it to go on living
and waiting and waiting.
Perhaps I ought not to have written this – perhaps I ought to have ignored having
a scrap only, altogether – but how I feel and what I think I must tell you always.
Darlint I hope you will never never never feel as miserable as
PEIDI.

Darlingest Boy
First of all last Sunday week a lady I don’t know her name – we all call her “2
jam pots high” asked after – “that nice curly headed boy.” We met her in Ilford in
the evening – I said when I last saw you – you were quite well. I wasn’t by myself
Darlint – he was with me.
I felt quite jealous that she should remember you all this time. Then last Wednes-
day I met your mother and she cut me. I wasn’t prepared for it either – I saw her
coming towards me and thought “as she spoke to me last time we met that there is
no reason why she shouldn’t this time.” And as she came up I just smiled, bowed,
said “How do you do” – she just took no notice whatever and walked on. I can’t
explain how I felt – I think I wanted to hit her more than anything – things get
worse and worse – instead of just a tiny bit better each day.
On Thursday afternoon I went to the G.P.O. for the Port Said Mail and encoun-
tered the ﬁrst man that I saw before – he handed me a registered envelope from
you (which contained the garters – thank you very much darlint) and told me
if I had an address in London I couldn’t have letters addressed to the G.P.O. – I
told him I hadn’t – but I don’t think he believed me anyway he didnt give me
your Port Said letter and I hadnt the patience to overcome (or try to) his bad
temper.
I went again on Monday and got it a different man was on duty – when I read
it – I didnt feel very satisﬁed darlint it didnt seem worth waiting all that time
for – 24 days – however I wont talk about it – you ought to know by now how I feel
about those things.
In one part of it you say you are going to still write to me because it will help, in
another part you say – “Perhaps I shant write to you from some ports – because I
want to help you.” I dont understand – I try to – but I cant – really I cant darling –
my head aches – aches with thinking sometimes.
Last Friday last year – we went to see “Romance” – then we were pals and this
year we seem no further advanced.
Why arnt you sending me something – I wanted you to – you never do what
I ask you darlint – you still have your own way always – If I don’t mind the risk
why should you? whatever happens cant be any more than this existence – looking
forward to nothing and gaining only ashes and dust and bitterness.
I’m not going to ask dad about you at all – I not going to say anything to
anybody – they can all think the worst of me that is possible – I am quite indifferent.
Miss Prior is on holiday and the only person in this world that is nice to me is Mr.
Carlton – I have had 2 half days off and am having another to-morrow afternoon –
all this time off makes me think of last year – when you were with me – rushing
home to see you.

I’ve had a brandy and soda some mornings – about 11-30 and a half bottle of
champagne between us – other mornings and I learn such a lot of things that are
interesting too.
This morning on the station I saw Molly – talking and laughing with Mr. Derry –
in case you dont remember the name – it’s the little man in the “White Horse.”
I’ve never seen her talk to him before altho she has passed me on the platform
talkingtohimseveraltimes(metalkingtohimImean)Ibowed–saidgoodmorning
to him as I passed and have since been wondering if they have told each other what
they know about me.

Darlingest boy – you worry me so much – what do you mean you say “I want to be
in England to look after you.” I can understand that and I want you to be here also –
but you then say “I want you to look after me too”. . . Whats the matter darlint, are
you ill? is anything the matter that I could help you in at all. I do believe youve been
ill – oh darlint why are you such miles away – why arent we together – so that I
could help you. Would you like a pillow? the pillow that only Peidie can give you –
Id love to have you here now so that I could give it you. Do tell me whats the matter
darlingest boy – I shall worry and worry all the time until you write and tell me. Its
Thursday and Ive just come from the G.P.O. with the Aden mail. Isnt it late this time
darlint it’s usually in on a Monday or at latest Tuesday. However Ive got it and thats
all that really matters Darlingest boy didnt I say a long time ago “Dont trust Dan.”
Of course I didnt mean that in the sense you have told me he couldnt be trusted in
but my instinct was right wasnt it? You will be careful wont you darlint pour moi?
I dont want to ever know or think that my own boy is in any predicament of that
sort – because Ill be too far away to help wont I? The thought of anything like that
makes my blood cold – Ill be always worrying. Im writing this letter rather early to
Colombo – because Im going away tomorrow and I shant have an opportunity of
writing to you again for a fortnight. Perhaps I could manage a letter card tho anyway
you’ll understand wont you darlint pal? I dont mind a bit pencil as long as its words

different – a good man like Nigel would have altered her darlint – she never knew
what it was to be denied anything – she never knew “goodness” as you and I know
it – she was never interested in a good man – or any man unless he could appease
her sensual nature. I don’t think she could have been happy with nothing – except
Baroudi on a desert island she liked – no loved and lived for his money or what it
could give her – the luxury of his yacht the secrecy with which he acted all bought
with his money – that’s what she liked.
Yes she was clever – I admire the cleverness – but she was cunning there is a
difference darlint, I don’t admire that – I certainly don’t think she would ever have
killed Nigel with her hands – she would have been found out – she didn’t like that
did she? being found out – it was that secret cunning in Baroudi that she admired
so much – the cunning that matched her own.
If she had loved Baroudi enough she could have gone to him – but she liked the
security of being Nigel’s wife – for the monetary assets it held.
She doesn’t seem a woman to me – she seems abnormal – a monster utterly
selﬁsh and self living.
Darlint this is where we differ about women.
Iusuallystandupforthem against youandinthiscaseitsthereversebuthonestly
darlint I dont call her a woman – she is absolutely unnatural in every sense.
You do say silly things to me – ‘try a little bit every day not to think about me –
doesn’t that ‘trying’ ever make it worse – it does for me always.
About the ‘age’ passages in ‘The Fruitful Vine’ – I marked them because as I read
they struck me as concerning you and I.
Darlint I didn’t do it with malice every passage in any book I read that strikes me
as concerning 2 pals I mark – it doesn’t matter what they are about.
I hadn’t mentioned the subject any more had I?
My veriest own lover I always think about the ‘difference’ when I’m with you
and when I’m away sometimes when I’m happy for a little while I forget – but I
always remember very soon – perhaps some little thing that you might say or do
when we’re together reminds me. Sometimes I think and think until my brain goes
round and round. ‘Shall I always be able to keep you.’ 8 years is such a long time –
it’s not now – it’s later – when I’m ‘Joan’ and you’re not grown old enough to be
‘Darby.’ When you’ve got something that you’ve never had before and something
that you’re so happy to have found – you’re always afraid of it ﬂying away – that’s
how I feel about your love.
Don’t ever take your love away from me darlint – I never want to lose it and live.
If it gets less and gradually fades away – don’t let me live to feel without it. It feels
a bigger fuller greater love that I have for my own and only lover now.
PEIDI.

Darlingest boy, today is the 27th and its on a Sunday, so I am writing this in the
bathroom, I always like to send you greetings on the day – not the day before or the
day after.
Fourteen whole months have gone by now, darlint, its so terribly long. Neither
you nor I thought we should have to wait all that long time did we? although I
said I would wait 5 years – and I will darlint – its only 3 years and ten months
now.
Many happy returns and good luck darlingest boy – I cant wish you any more
can I? every day I say ‘Good luck to my Pal’ to myself.

[Postmark – London, E.C., Sept. 12, 1922, 5.30 p.m.]
Darlint Pal,
I’ve got nothing to talk to you about – I can’t think about anything at all –
I can’t even look forward to seeing you. Now you are nearing England – I keep
contrasting this home coming with the previous ones. I have been buoyed up
with hope, bubbling with excitement Just existing with an intense strung up feel-
ing of seeing you and feeling you holding me in your two arms so tightly that it
hurts but this time everything seems different. I don’t hear from you much you
don’t talk to me by letter and help me and I don’t even know if I am going to see
you.
Darlint, I’m an awful little beast I know – I don’t want to be either – but I feel so
hopeless – just drifting – but if you say ‘No I won’t see you’ then it shall be so, I’m
quite reconciled to whatever verdict you send forth and shall say to myself ‘It is for
the best it must be so.’
Darlint you do love me still tho’ don’t you? and you will go on loving me even
if we don’t meet. Things here are going smoothly with me – I am giving all – and
accepting everything and I think am looked upon as ‘The Dutiful Wife’ whose spirit
is at last bent to the will of her husband.’
This isn’t sarcasm or cynicism its exactly how I feel. I had a little letter from
you – by what you said it was written on the 28th of July Ive had nothing – further
there are heaps and heaps of questions in my letters to you.
I wonder if you will answer them, or are they already dismissed? On Saturday I
was so ill. I had to stop away – its not very often I give in so much as stopping away
from business but on Saturday I really had to I’m quite alright now tho’ darlint.
I don’t think I told you I bought a fur coat – at least part of it. It was 27 gns. and
I had £13 saved up – so I borrowed £15 from the account and am paying it back
at £1 per week – the debt is only £10 now.

Also I’ve had to fall back on wearing lace shoes – no don’t make a face darlint,
they are rather nice ones – I wanted grey and could get nothing at all in my usual
style – only with one or two straps across – and I don’t like these – even if they hid
my foot I shouldn’t – they look loud, so I bought lace ones, only to wear with cloth
clothes tho’ darlint – not with silk.
Yesterday you were at Suez – I suppose you got my Port Said letters there and on
Friday or Saturday, you will get these – I think the mail facilities favour you more
than me darlint.
Darlingest pal – do let me hear an awful lot from you next week – I’m just existing
now – I shall live then.
Darlingest, only lover of mine – try to cheer me up.

Darlingest lover of mine, thank you, thank you, oh thank you a thousand times for
Friday – it was lovely – its always lovely to go out with you.
AndthenSaturday–yesIdidfeelhappy–Ididn’tthinkateenybitaboutanything
in this world, except being with you – and all Saturday evening I was thinking about
you – I was just with you in a big arm chair in front of a great big ﬁre feeling all the
time how much I had won – cos I have darlint, won such a lot – it feels such a great
big thing to me sometimes-that I can’t breathe.
When you are away and I see girls with men walking along together – perhaps
they are acknowledged sweethearts – they look so ordinary then I feel proud – so
proud to think and feel that you are my lover and even tho’ not acknowledged I can
still hold you – just with a tiny ‘hope.’
Darlint, we’ve said we’ll always be Pals haven’t we, shall we say we’ll always be
lovers – even tho’ secret ones, or is it (this great big love) a thing we can’t control –
dare we say that – I think I will dare. Yes I will ‘I’ll always love you’ – if you are dead –
if you have left me even if you don’t still love me, I always shall you.
Your love to me is new, it is something different, it is my life and if things should
go badly with us, I shall always have this past year to look back upon and feel that
‘Then I lived’ I never did before and I never shall again.
Darlingest lover, what happened last night? I don’t know myself I only know how
I felt – no not really how I felt but how I could feel – if time and circumstances were
different.
It seems like a great welling up of love – of feeling – of inertia, just as if I am wax
in your hands – to do with as you will and I feel that if you do as you wish I shall
be happy, its physical purely and I can’t really describe it – but you will understand
darlint wont you? You said you knew it would be like this one day – if it hadn’t
would you have been disappointed. Darlingest when you are rough, I go dead – try
not to be please.
The book is lovely – it’s going to be sad darlint tho’, why can’t life go on happy
always?

I like Clarie – she is so natural so unworldly.
Why ar’nt you an artist and I as she is – I feel when I am reading frightfully
jealous of her – its a picture darlint, just how I did once picture that little ﬂat in
Chelsea – why can’t he go on loving her always – why are men different – I am right
when I say that love to a man is a thing apart from his life – but to a woman it is her
whole existence.
I tried so hard to ﬁnd a way out of tonight darlingest but he was suspicious and still
is – I suppose we must make a study of this deceit for some time longer. I hate it. I
hate every lie I have to tell to see you – because lies seem such small mean things to
attain such an object as ours. We ought to be able to use great big things for great big
love like ours. I’d love to be able to say ‘I’m going to see my lover tonight.’ If I did he
would prevent me – there would be scenes and he would come to 168 and interfere
and I couldn’t bear that – I could be beaten all over at home and still be deﬁant –
but at 168 it’s different. It’s my living – you wouldn’t let me live on him would you
and I shouldn’t want to – darlint its funds that are our stumbling block – until we
have those we can do nothing. Darlingest ﬁnd me a job abroad. I’ll go tomorrow
and not say I was going to a soul and not have one little regret. I said I wouldn’t
think – that I’d try to forget – circumstances – Pal, help me to forget again – I have
succeeded up to now – but its thinking of tonight and tomorrow when I can’t see
you and feel you holding me.
Darlint – do something tomorrow night will you? something to make you forget.
I’ll be hurt I know, but I want you to hurt me – I do really – the bargain now, seems
so one sided – so unfair – but how can I alter it?
About the watch – I didn’t think you thought more of that – how can I explain what
I did feel? I felt that we had parted – you weren’t going to see me – I had given you
something to remind you of me and I had purposely retained it. If I said “come for
it” you would – but only the once and it would be as a pal, because you would want
me so badly at times – that the watch would help you not to feel so badly and if you
hadn’t got it – the feeling would be so great – it would conquer you against your
will.
Darlint do I ﬂatter myself when I think you think more of the watch than of
anything else. That wasn’t a present – that was something you asked me to give
you – when we decided to be pals a sort of sealing of the compact. I couldn’t afford
it then, but immediately I could I did. Do you remember when and where we were
when you asked me for it? If you do tell me, if you don’t, forget I asked.
How I thought you would feel about the watch, I would feel about something I
have.
It isn’t mine, but it belongs to us and unless we were differently situated than we
are now, I would follow you everywhere – until you gave it to me back.

Darlingest boy, thank you –
I know what you say is really true, but darlint it does feel sometimes that we are

Yes, we are both going to ﬁght until we win – darlint, ﬁght hard, in real earnest –

and I’m wondering – I can’t help it darlint if I’ve done right in asking you to take me
out. And apart from this feeling that I have, there is that ever present question of
money – darlint you’ve never told me this time once about money – what you had
and what you spent and I felt hurt – horribly darlint, especially about the suit – last
time you told me about the coat – but not this time – why the difference darlint?
And as I haven’t any money to give you, at least not much and perhaps you havn’t
any I wish you weren’t going to take me out darlint and even now its not too late – if
you’d only tell me, be quite frank about it darlint, I’ll understand – surely you know
I will. I didn’t intend to mention this darlint, but neither you nor I must harbour
thoughts that each other doesn’t know, must we, we must be one in thoughts and
wishes and actions always darlint, so I have. Please understand how I feel and know
I love you.

4. Evidence from the trial: the Defence
a. Extracts from cross-examination of Bywaters
Did you then tell him that you were in love with his wife? – No.
Did you suggest any grounds upon which either she or he was to obtain a
divorce? – No.
Was divorce mentioned? – Divorce or separation was mentioned.
Were you not at this time attempting to keep back from him all suspicion as to
your relations with Mrs. Thompson? – No, I was not attempting to keep it back.
Did you ever tell him up to that time? – No.
Had you and Mrs. Thompson at that time spoken about suicide? – Yes.
Do you remember when that proposal was abandoned? – Abandoned?
Yes. Was it abandoned? – Yes, the pact of suicide was abandoned.
It is referred to in exhibit No. 62, the letter of 18th November, 1921 –
All I could think about last night was that compact we made. Shall we have to carry it
thro’?
Was that pact of suicide abandoned after that letter? – I never really considered it
seriously.
May we take it from that time forward there was no more thought of the suicide
pact? – Oh yes, there was; it was mentioned.
But not really entertained by you? – No.
Do you say from that time forward the only idea in your mind or hers was divorce
or separation? – Or suicide on her part.
But the suicide, I put to you, after that letter was not seriously entertained? – Not
by me, but by her it was.
Except for the suicide on her part you say that you or she only contemplated
separation or divorce? – That is true, or me to take her away.

Analysis of Evidence
Was the removal of her husband ever mentioned by her to you? – No.
Never? – Never.
Did it ever occur to you that that was a way in which you and she might come
together? – No.
Did her letters suggest it to you? – No.
Did you tell your learned counsel that you read her letters as melodrama? – Some.
What was it you understand as melodrama? – She had a vivid way of declaring
herself; she would read a book and imagine herself as the character in the book.
Do you mean that you read her references to poison as melodrama? – Some as
melodrama; some as general knowledge.
General knowledge? – Yes.
I don’t understand that. What did you understand when she mentioned a par-
ticular poison? – To what are you referring?
Are you aware, or do you remember, that she mentioned several times a poison
in her letters? – Yes.
Did that suggest to you a dose of poison might kill her husband? – No.
It did not occur to you? – No.
Did you not read those letters as meaning that the idea was in her mind? – No.
Did she ever make an actual proposal to you that you and she might go off
together? – Yes.
When did she ﬁrst make it? – I suppose it was about the November when I came
home.
Did you agree to the proposal or did you reject it? – I said, “Wait and see what
happens.”
What were you going to wait for? – To see if she could get a separation or divorce.
And how long were you going to wait? – A period of ﬁve years.
Did you ever mean to do anything to make a divorce possible? – No.
You had no intention of taking any action? – No.
Will you turn to the letter of 1st April, exhibit No. 17. “I thought a lot about what
you said of Dan”? – I had told Mrs. Thompson about a friend of mine named Dan.
That is all you had told her? – I told her of some of his business that he had told
me. I had not told him anything about myself and Mrs. Thompson.
Then will you follow while I read –
Darlint, don’t trust him – I don’t mean don’t tell him anything because I know you never
would – what I mean is don’t let him be suspicious of you regarding that – because if
we were successful in the action – darlint circumstances may afterwards make us want
many friends – or helpers and we must have no enemies – or even people that know a
little too much. Remember the saying “A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.”
What was “the action” that she there refers to? – Suicide, as far as I remember.
But, Bywaters, read it again. What does “the action” mean? – Mrs. Thompson
had proposed to me that she did not want to make my life as unhappy as hers. She
said she would sooner kill herself.

205
Do you really suggest that “the action” means suicide? – As far as I remember,
yes,it means suicide.
Are you quite clear it does not mean crime? – I am positive of that.
I am coming back to that letter. Look now at exhibit No. 50. This is written before
31st March and you had been home for about a fortnight at the end of January and
again for a few days at the end of March? – Yes
Read what Mrs. Thompson says in that letter –
This time really will be the last time you will go away – like things are, won’t it? We
said it before darlint I know and we failed – but there will be no failure this next time
darlint, there mustn’t be.
Had there been a failure? – Yes.
What had you tried that had failed? – Separation or divorce.
Does it occur to you what was the best way to get a divorce if that was all you
wanted? – Yes, I know the best way of getting a divorce.
What was the best way of getting a divorce for Mrs. Thompson from her
husband? – To provide Mr. Thompson with the information he needed.
Why did you not try? – Because he would not accept.
Did you provide him with the information? – She had.
Had she provided him with the information to enable him to get a divorce? –
She said she would provide him with the information to get a divorce.
Had she tried to give him the information to get a divorce? – She said she would
do it.
My question was had she tried to get a divorce from her husband? – She had sug-
gestedtohimshewantedadivorce,andshewouldprovidehimwiththeinformation
he required if he would come to terms.
I suggest to you that “failure” there refers to the same thing as “action” in the
other letter – that Mrs. Thompson had tried to poison her husband and had failed? –
And I say that that is not true.
What you say is that it refers to information or a statement she had thought of
making to her husband to make him divorce her? – Yes, or separation.
Were you and she really anxious that he should know that you and Mrs.
Thompson were lovers? – He did know.
From what time did he know? – I do not know he exactly knew we were lovers.
He knew we were fond of each other.
Did you not do your best to keep it from him from start to ﬁnish? – Oh no.
Will you turn to the letter of 3rd January, 1922, exhibit No. 13 –
Immediately I have received a second letter, I have destroyed the ﬁrst and when I got
the third I destroyed the second and so on, now the only one I have is the “Dear Edie”
one written to 41, which I’m going to keep. It may be useful, who knows?
Was that the letter of 1st December, exhibit 14, beginning “Dear Edie” and signed
“Yours very sincerely, Freddy”? – Yes.

Analysis of Evidence
Was that the customary way in which you wrote to Mrs. Thompson at that
time? – No.
Was that letter written in that form in order to disarm suspicion? – No.
Did you understand from the passage I have just read from the letter of 3rd
January that she was going to use that letter to disarm suspicion? – No.
Did you understand what was meant when she said “It may be useful – who
knows”? – I do not know.
Would the letter be any use to get a divorce or separation? – I think that she is
referring to the latter.
I take it you would agree with me the letter would not be useful for that
purpose? – I do not agree with you. I never said that.
You do not follow me. You agree with me that that letter which says “Dear Edie,”
and ﬁnishes “Yours very sincerely” would be of no use to enable either her or you
to get a divorce? – That letter was not meant to be a means of getting a divorce. It
was a letter conveying Christmas greetings.
Did you understand what she meant when she said “This letter may be useful;
I will keep it?” – She may have kept this to show to her sister Avis; that was one of
the reasons that I wrote it.
Then you did write it to blind somebody? – Oh yes.
Did the subject of poisons ever occur in your conversations with her when you
were at home? – Sometimes.
In what connection? – General conversation; knowledge.
Who mentioned poisons? – If she had been reading anything and poison was
mentioned, and any matter that she would not understand, she would ask me what
it meant.
Did you know anything about poison? – I did not know very much.
Did she appear to be interested in poison? – No, not particularly.
Did it ever strike you it occupied a prominent place in her mind? – No more
than other things.
Did you take an interest in poison? – I was fond of chemistry when I was at
school.
But chemistry and poison are two different things? – Poisons deal with chemistry.
Poisons come in chemistry.
Did you take any interest in poisons as poisons? – No.
Did you keep up your interest which you say you had in chemistry? – No, I did
not. She knew of that interest, though; her brother used to join me.
Do you suggest then that the mention of poison in your conversation and in your
letters was due to the fact that she knew you were interested in chemistry? Is that
your explanation? – No, my explanation is this: if she had been reading something
and it occurred to her, if I had been in her presence she would have asked me what
it was. If I was not there, she put it in writing.
Do you remember a document which you wrote out containing the troy weights,
exhibit 57? “60 milligrams= 1 grain, 18 grains= 1 gramme, 30 grammes= 1 oz.” Is
that your handwriting? – Yes.

207
When did you write it? – I could not say.
Why did you keep it? – Because it is useful in general knowledge.
Had that any connection with the request she made to you to experiment with
pills? – Oh no.
Turn back to the letter of 1st April, exhibit No. 17, and listen to this paragraph –
He was telling his Mother etc. the circumstances of my ‘Sunday morning escapade’ and
he puts great stress on the fact of the tea tasting bitter ‘as if something had been put
in it’ he says. Now I think whatever else I try it in again will still taste bitter – he will
recognise it and be more suspicious still and if the quantity is still not successful it will
injure any chance I may have of trying when you come home. Do you understand?
What did you understand about that passage? – That she had taken the quinine and
it tasted bitter.
Look at it again –
He puts great stress on the fact of the tea tasting bitter ‘as if something had been put in
it’ he says.
To whom did it taste bitter? – Mrs. Thompson.
Do you suggest that, Bywaters? – I do.
Do you suggest that is how you understood the letter when you received it? – I
do.
Now I think whatever else I try it in again will still taste bitter – he will recognise it and
be more suspicious still.
Do you still adhere to what you say, that she is speaking of her taste? – Yes.
What did you understand him to be suspicious of? – That she was attempting to
commit suicide.
Did you understand her to mean that she would tell him that her tea tasted bitter
and she was about to commit suicide? – Possibly she would.
Is that your understanding of that passage? – That is.
Look at the letter of 1st May (exhibit 19) –
I don’t think we’re failures in other things and we mustn’t be in this.
Did you understand what that referred to? – Yes.
What? – Well, if you read further, “We mustn’t give up as we said.”
What was that? – Give up trying for a separation or divorce.
We must learn to be patient. We must have each other darlint. It’s meant to be I know
I feel it is because I love you such a lot – such a love was not meant to be in vain. It
will come right I know one day, if not by our efforts some other way. We’ll wait eh
darlint, and you’ll try and get some money and then we can go away and not worry
about anybody or anything. You said it was enough for an elephant.
Do you remember saying that? – Yes.
Did you say that in writing or in speech? – In speech.

Analysis of Evidence
Are you clear about that? Did you say it in a letter or in a conversation when you
were at home? – I really do not remember whether it was in conversation or in a
letter.
And what was it you said was enough for an elephant? – The quinine I had given
Mrs. Thompson.
For what had you given her quinine? – She had been wanting me to get her
something with which to commit suicide, as she did not want to make my life as
unhappy as hers. To satisfy her craving I said I would get her something, and I gave
her quinine.
It is your suggestion that in May, 1922, you were lending your assistance to her
desire to commit suicide? – Her suggestion.
You say you gave her this quinine because she wanted something with which to
commit suicide. Is that right? – Yes, that is so.
Did you give her quinine with that object? – I did.
Were you therefore willing to help her to commit suicide? – No, I knew she could
not hurt herself with quinine.
You were playing with her ideas? – I was pulling her leg.
You said it was enough for an elephant. Perhaps it was. But you don’t allow for the taste
making only a small quantity to be taken. It sounded like a reproach was it meant to
be?
That is your explanation, that you were playing a joke upon her? – That is so.
She goes on –
Darlint I tried hard – you won’t know how hard – because you weren’t there to see and
I can’t tell you all – but I did – I do want you to believe I did for both of us . . . I was
buoyed up with the hope of the ‘light bulb’ and I used a lot.
Did you understand that as referring to a dose she herself took of broken glass? –
Possibly, yes. She was trying to persuade me to give her something with which to
commit suicide, and I refrained. I gave her this quinine so that she would not take
anything herself.
But in the next passage that I have called your attention to she refers to another
speciﬁc –
I was buoyed up, with the hope of the ‘light bulb’ and I used a lot – big pieces too.
Did you understand that to mean that she had taken glass? – I understood that to
be a lie from her to me.
You understood, even if it was a lie, that what it was a lie about was what she had
taken herself? – Oh, yes.
ByMr.Justice Shearman –Lookatit.Wasshelyingaboutwhatherhusband
had taken or what she had taken herself? – I say she was lying about what she had
taken herself.

b. Further extracts from the cross-examination of Bywaters
Look at the letter written on 1st October (exhibit No. 60) at the end –
Don’t forget what we talked in the Tea Room, I’ll still risk and try if you will – we only
have 3 3
4 years left darlingest.
What did you understand the risk was that she was prepared to run? – The risk of
being knocked about when she was asking for separation or divorce.
What was the risk that you were to run, “I will still risk and try if you will”? – “If
you will let me.”
How was she going to run the risk of being knocked about by telling her husband
she was going with you? – No, by asking for a divorce or separation.
Then you did in fact meet her and never went near her husband? – I kept away;
I did not want further trouble.
You met her at Fullers in the afternoon of 3rd October? – Yes.
Did you have any conversation about her husband? – No.
Did you not refer to him? – Only that she was going to the theatre.
She did tell you that she was going to the theatre? – Yes.
And she told you which theatre? – Yes.
After you left her I understand you went straight to the Graydons? – Yes.
Were you carrying your knife when you went there? – I was.
Did you carry that knife everywhere while in England? – Yes.
Did you ever use it for anything? – Cutting string or cutting things handy.
Is that the purpose for which you carried it? – I bought that – it may be handy at
any time.
A knife of that size and character? – Yes, handy at sea.
Handy at sea, but was it handy at home? – Yes.
c. Extracts from the examination of Thompson
The next letter I want you to look at is the one dated 20th August, 1921 (exhibit
12) –
Come and see me Monday lunch time, please darlint. He suspects.
What did you mean by “he suspects”? – I meant that my husband suspected I had
seen Bywaters; I think it was on the Friday previous to that date. I usually saw him
on Fridays, and I continued to see him until he sailed on 9th September. He came
back in the end of October, and remained in this country until 11th November.
After he sailed I corresponded with him, and among other letters I wrote exhibit
62, which is undated.
All I could think about last night was that compact we made. Shall we have to carry it
thro’? Don’t let us darlint. I’d like to live and be happy – not for a little while, but for all
the while you still love me. Death seemed horrible last night – when you think about

Analysis of Evidence
it darlint, it does seem a horrible thing to die, when you have never been happy really
happy for one little minute.
What compact were you referring to in that letter to Bywaters? – The compact of
suicide. We had discussed the question of suicide some time previous to the writing
of this letter; I cannot state when.
What was said about it? – That nothing was worth living for, and that it would
be far easier to be dead.
Had you discussed any particular means of committing suicide? – I believe we
had.
After Bywaters had sailed on that voyage did you send him from time to time
cuttingsoutofthepapers?–Idid.Theyweregenerallycuttingsofsensationalmatters
appearing at the time. Amongst the cuttings that I sent there was an account of an
inquest upon a girl, Freda Kempton, who had died through taking an overdose of
cocaine.
In your letter of 14th March, 1922 (exhibit 20), you say –
Enclosed are some cuttings that may be interesting. I think the ‘red hair’ one is true in
parts – you tell me which parts darlint. The Kempton cutting may be interesting if it’s
to be the same method.
What were you referring to there? – Our compact of suicide.
Look at the letter (exhibit 27) where you say –
I had the wrong Porridge to-day, but I don’t suppose it will matter, I don’t seem to care
much either way. You’ll probably say I’m careless and I admit I am, but I don’t care –
do you?
What were you referring to? – I really cannot explain.
The suggestion here is that you had from time to time put things into your
husband’s porridge, glass, for instance? – I had not done so.
Can you give us any explanation of what you had in your mind when you said
you had the wrong porridge? – Except we had suggested or talked about that sort
of thing and I had previously said, “Oh yes, I will give him something one of these
days.”
ByMr.Justice Shearman –Doyoumeanthatyouhadtalkedaboutpoison?–
I did not mean anything in particular.
Examination continued – We had talked about making my husband ill.
How had you come to talk about making your husband ill? – We were discussing
my unhappiness.
Did that include your husband’s treatment of you? – Yes.
Now you say you probably said that you would give him something? – I did.
Did you ever give him anything? – Nothing whatever. My husband took porridge
in the mornings. It was always prepared by Mrs. Lester, and never by me.
Further on in that same letter (exhibit 27), you say –

You know darlint I am beginning to think I have gone wrong in the way I manage this
affair. I think perhaps it would have been better had I acquiesced in everything he said
and did or wanted to do. At least it would have disarmed any suspicion he might have
and that would have been better if we have to use drastic measures.
What were you meaning by the “drastic measures” you might have to use? – Leaving
England with Bywaters.
Look now at the letter of 3rd January, 1922 (exhibit 13), where you say –
Immediately I have received a second letter, I have destroyed the ﬁrst and when I got
the third I destroyed the second and so on, now the only one I have is the “Dear Edie”
one written to 41, which I am going to keep. It may be useful, who knows?
Why were you keeping that letter? – I wanted to show it to my people if I were asked
if I had heard from Mr. Bywaters for Christmas. It was a letter wishing me all good
wishes for Christmas and my people were certain to ask if I had heard from him.
Otherwise I did not keep Bywaters’ letters, it being a habit of mine to destroy letters
that I had received.
d. Further extracts from the examination of Thompson
Turn now to your letter of 28th August (exhibit 63) –
Darlingest boy, to-day is the 27th and it’s on a Sunday, so I am writing this in the
bathroom, I always like to send you greetings on the day – not the day before or
the day after. Fourteen whole months have gone by now, darlint, it’s so terribly long.
Neither you nor I thought we should have to wait all that long time did we? altho’
I said I would wait 5 years – and I will darlint – it’s only 3 years and ten months
now.
What did you mean by that – it is only three years and ten months to what? – To
wait.
For what? – To live with Mr. Bywaters or go away with him, or be with him only.
Had you made arrangement with Bywaters to wait for ﬁve years? – Yes.
What was to happen at the end of ﬁve years? – If he was not in a successful
position to take me away or had not in the meantime found me something to go
to – well, we should part.
Mr. Justice Shearman – The other witness’s story was that they wanted
to commit suicide, and he said, “Put it off ﬁve years,” which seems to be the one
sensible thing I have heard.
(To Witness) – Was that discussed when you wanted to commit suicide together,
that you should put it off and wait ﬁve years to see how he was getting on? – We
might have discussed that, but I do not remember about it.
Examination continued – I was quite prepared to wait ﬁve years.
Will you turn to exhibit 28, where you say –

Analysis of Evidence
Yes, darlint, you are jealous of him – but I want you to be – he has the right by law to
all that you have the right to by nature and love – yes darlint be jealous, so much that
you will do something desperate.
What do you mean by doing something desperate? – To take me away at any cost,
to do anything to get me away from England.
Look at exhibit 60. Do you remember the day on which you wrote that letter? – I
think it was probably on the Monday, 2nd October. I saw Bywaters on the Monday,
but I could not be certain whether it was before or after the writing of the letter. On
the Saturday I had told him of my engagement to go to the theatre on the Tuesday.
It is quite probable that that engagement was made a fortnight before.
In that letter you say –
Darlint – do something tomorrow night will you?something to make you forget. I’ll
be hurt I know, but I want you to hurt me – I do really – the bargain now seems so
one-sided – so unfair – but how can I alter it.
“To-morrow night” was the night you were going to the theatre. What had Bywaters
to forget? – That I was going somewhere with my husband.
What was he to do to make him forget that? – I wanted him to take my sister Avis
out.
You say, “I will be hurt, I know.” What did that mean? – I should have been hurt
by Bywaters being with a lady other than myself.
In that letter you also say –
Darlingest ﬁnd me a job abroad. I’ll go tomorrow and not say I was going to a soul and
not have one little regret.
Did that really represent your feelings at that time, that you were prepared to go
abroad with him at once? – Yes. We had discussed it on the Saturday.
Look at the end of that letter –
Don’t forget what we talked in the Tea Room, I’ll still risk and try if you will.
What had you discussed in the tearoom? – My freedom.
Had you at any time from the month of June, 1921, to the month of October of
this year any desire for Bywaters to commit any injury on your husband? – None
whatever. Bywaters returned from his last voyage on 23rd September, but I did not
see him until Monday, the 25th. I saw him again during that week and at nine o’clock
on Saturday, the 30th. I left him to do some shopping, and then I rejoined him, and
was with him until mid-day. We spent the morning in Wanstead Park. I did not see
him again on the Saturday or the Sunday. I saw him on Monday, 2nd October, I
think at 2.15, outside 168 Aldersgate Street, and we lunched together. After lunch I
returned to business. I saw him again in Fullers about ﬁve o’clock that afternoon,
and I believe I had a coffee with him. I stayed with him until about quarter to seven,
when I returned home. I did not see him again that night.

213
During the time you were with Bywaters on the Saturday and the Monday, apart
from discussing a separation, did you discuss your husband at all? – No, I did not.
Was there any mention or any indication of a possible assault being committed
on him? – None whatever. On Tuesday, 3rd October, I went to business as usual,
and I saw Bywaters about 12.30, when we lunched together. I saw him again about
quarter-past ﬁve, and was with him for about quarter of an hour. After leaving
him I met my husband in Aldersgate Street, and we went straight west – about
quarter to six I think it was. We had a slight meal together before going to the
theatre.
Did you anticipate, or had you any reason to think, that you would see Bywaters
again that day or not? – None whatever. I had made arrangements to see him on
the following day at lunch time at 168 Aldersgate Street.
e. Extracts from cross-examination of Thompson
Had you any doubt when you were asked by the police about it that it was Bywaters
who was there and was the man? – No, I had not.
May I take it that when you made the long statement (exhibit 3) you left out
Bywaters’ name in order to shield him? – I did so.
Did you also say this in the statement: “I have always been on affectionate terms
with my husband”? – I cannot say that I actually said that. The statement was made
as question and answer.
I think it was read over to you and you signed it? – It might have been, yes.
At any rate, is the statement true or untrue? – It is untrue.
If you left Bywaters out of that statement in order to shield him, were you afraid
that if you brought his name into it he would be suspected? – I was not afraid of
anything. I left it out entirely.
Why? What were you afraid of if you did not know your husband had been
stabbed? – I was not afraid of anything.
What were you going to shield him from? – To have his name brought into it.
Were you not going to shield him from a charge of having murdered your hus-
band? – I did not know my husband was murdered.
Did you not know that your husband had been assaulted and murdered? – The
inspector told me, but I did not realise even at that time that he was dead.
Inspector Hall had told you then that your husband was dead? – He had.
When you told those untruths and left out Bywaters, were you not attempting to
shield him from a charge of having murdered your husband? – I did not even know
my husband had been murdered. When I say that I did not know, I mean that I did
not realise it.
I will ask you again, what were you attempting to shield Bywaters from? – From
being connected with me – his name being brought into anything.
Now, Mrs. Thompson, is it not the fact that you knew that Bywaters was going to
do something on this evening and that these two false statements were an attempt
to prevent the police getting wind of it? – That is not so.

Analysis of Evidence
Now I will go back to the early stages of your relationship with Bywaters. Do you
agree with me that it was in June of 1921 that you ﬁrst fell in love with Bywaters? –
No, I did not.
Do you put it in November? – September, I said.
Look at your letter of 28th August, 1922 (exhibit 63), where you say –
Fourteen whole months have gone by now, darlint, it’s so terribly long. Neither you nor
I thought we should have to wait all that long time.
Does that not satisfy you that you and Bywaters declared love to each other in June,
1921? – Not at all.
You deny that? – Yes.
When did you ﬁrst begin to address him as your lover? – It is just what you mean
by “your lover.”
The terms in which a woman does not write to any man except her husband? –
I cannot remember.
Did you from the ﬁrst time you realised you were in love with Bywaters take an
aversion to your husband? – For the ﬁrst time, did you say?
Did you ever take an aversion to your husband? – I did.
Can you tell me the date? – I think it was in 1918.
Then both before and after you and Bywaters fell in love with each other you
hated – is that too strong a word – your husband? – It is too strong.
Did your aversion to him become greater when you fell in love with Bywaters? –
I think not.
Were you happy with him after you fell in love with Bywaters? – I never was
happy with him.
Did you behave to him as if you were happy? – On occasions, yes.
Did your husband repeatedly ask you if you were happy? – He did.
And did you tell him you were happy? – I did.
Was that to deceive him? – It was to satisfy him more than to deceive him.
Did you seriously at that time intend to leave your husband or to give him cause
for divorce? – I did.
Did you ever tell him you had given him cause for divorce? – I did.
When, for the ﬁrst time? – I cannot remember.
Were you afraid your husband would ﬁnd out anything between you and
Bywaters? – What do you mean by “anything”?
Were you frightened that your husband would ﬁnd out anything between you
and Bywaters? – Except that we were meeting and he might come and prevent us
meeting.
But if you had told your husband that you had given him ground for divorce,
what were you afraid of beyond that? – I was afraid of my husband coming to my
place of business and making scenes as he had threatened.
You had told your husband that you had been unfaithful to him, or would be
unfaithful to him, and given him grounds for divorce? – I did.

Had he made scenes at your business when you told him that? – No, he did not,
but he had threatened to do so.
Whatwastheriskyouwererunning,theriskyousooftenmentionedtoBywaters?
Look at your letter of 4th July (exhibit 26) –
Why arnt you sending me something – I wanted you to – you never do what I ask you
darlint – you still have your own way always – If I don’t mind the risk why should you?
What risk? – That was the risk of Mr. Bywaters sending me something instead of
bringing something.
Why was that a risk? – Well, it would be a risk for me to receive anything.
Not a risk to receive a letter? – I did not say a letter.
What was it? – Whatever Mr. Bywaters suggested.
Why should you think there was a risk in his sending you something? – I did not
know that I should personally receive it.
Why should there be a risk in a friend or even a lover sending you a letter or a
present? – I did not say it was a letter.
What was it? – Something Mr. Bywaters suggested.
Did he suggest it was a dangerous thing? – No.
Why did you think it was a dangerous thing? – I did not think it was a dangerous
thing.
Why did you think there was a risk? – There was a risk to anything he sent me
that did not come into my hands ﬁrst.
Did you think it was because somebody would think there was a liaison going
on between you and him? – No, only you would not like anything private being
opened by somebody previous to yourself.
You were afraid somebody might have thought there were improper relations
between you and him. Is that what you are referring to? – No.
I understand you did not mind your husband knowing you and Mr. Bywaters
were lovers? – We wanted him to realise it.
The more it came to the knowledge of your husband the more likely you were to
achieve your design of divorce or separation; is that the fact? – No, that is not so.
The more it came to his knowledge the more he would refuse to give it me; he had
told me that.
In the passage I have read you were asking Bywaters to send something which he
had said, according to you, he was going to bring? – That is so.
What was it? – I have no idea.
Have you no idea? – Except what he told me.
What did he tell you? – He would bring me something.
Did he not say what the something was? – No, he did not mention anything.
What did he lead you to think it was? – That it was something for me to give my
husband.
With a view to poisoning your husband? – That was not the idea, that was not
what I expected.

Analysis of Evidence
Something to give your husband that would hurt him? – To make him ill.
And it was a risk for your lover to send, and for you to receive, something of that
sort? – It was a risk for him to send me anything he did not know came to my hands
ﬁrst.
Andaspecialrisktosendyousomethingtomakeyourhusbandill.Youappreciate
that? – Yes, I suppose it was.
You were urging Bywaters to send it instead of bringing it? – That is so.
Was that in order that it might be used more quickly? – I wrote that in order
to make him think I was willing to do anything he might suggest, to enable me to
retain his affections.
Mrs. Thompson, is that quite a frank explanation of this urging him to send
instead of bring? – It is, absolutely. I wanted him to think I was eager to help him.
By Mr. Justice Shearman – Eager to do what? – Eager to help him in doing
anything he suggested.
That does not answer the question, you know.
Cross-examination continued – He suggested giving your husband something to
hurt him? – He had given me something.
Given you something to give your husband? – That is so.
Did the suggestion then come from Bywaters? – It did.
Did the suggestion come in a letter or in a conversation? – I cannot remember.
Did you welcome it when it came? – I read it. What? – I read it and I studied it.
Didyouwelcome the suggestion that something shouldbegiventoyourhusband
to make him ill? – I did not.
Did you object to it? – I was astonished about it.
Did you object to it? – I did, at the time.
And although you objected to it you urged Bywaters to send it more quickly than
he intended? – I objected at the time. Afterwards I acquiesced.
From the time you acquiesced did you do all you could to assist Bywaters to ﬁnd
something which would make your husband ill? – I did not.
Did you try to prevent him from ﬁnding something to make your husband ill? –
I could not prevent him; he was not in England.
Did you try? – I do not see how I could have tried. Did you discourage him? – I
did, at ﬁrst.
And afterwards did you encourage him? – No.
Lookatyourletterof1stApril(exhibit17).Whatisthemeaningoftheinjunction
in that letter, “Don’t keep this piece”? – I cannot remember now.
Shall I help you to remember, if you read the next passage? – It may not have
referred to that piece.
Look at the original letter. You see that that injunction is written on the top of a
new page? – Yes.
Did you intend Bywaters not to keep that piece of paper? – No.
“Don’t keep this piece”? – I think you will see there has been something attached
to that piece of paper. There are distinctly two pin marks there.

You dispute my suggestion to you that “Don’t keep this paper” refers to the piece
on which the following is written? – I do.
Look at the next paragraph. It is about giving your husband something bitter. I
think you told your learned counsel that was an imaginary incident? – Yes.
Do you mean that you imagined it, or that your husband did? – I imagined it.
Do you mean you invented the incident altogether for Bywaters’ information? –
I did.
Can you tell me what the object of that was? – Still to make him think I had done
what he suggested.
By Mr. Justice Shearman – Had done what? Given your husband some-
thing? – Yes.
Cross-examination continued – Was it with the same object that you wrote the
paragraph lower down, “Don’t tell Dan.” You say –
What I mean is don’t let him be suspicious of you regarding that – because if we were
successful in the action –
Does that refer to the proposal that Bywaters had made, that you should make your
husband ill? – I think not.
What do you think it refers to? – The action of my going away to live with him
unmarried.
I’m going to try the glass again occasionally – when it is safe. I’ve got an electric light
globe this time.
When was it likely to be safe? – There was no question of it being safe; I was not
going to try it.
Why did you tell Bywaters you were going to try it when it was safe? – Still to let
him think I was willing to do what he wanted.
You are representing that this young man was seriously suggesting to you that
you should poison and kill your husband? – I did not suggest it.
I thought that was the suggestion? – I did not suggest that.
What was your suggestion? – He said he would give him something.
By Mr. Justice Shearman – Give him something in his food; you answered
my question a little while ago that it was to give him something to make him ill? –
That is what I surmised, that I should give him something so that when he had a
heart attack he would not be able to resist it.
You are suggesting now that it was Bywaters who was suggesting that to you? –
Yes.
And you did not do it? – No, never.
Cross-examination continued – Why were you urging Bywaters to do something
if the suggestion really came from him? In your letter of 10th February (exhibit 15)
your ﬁrst sentence is, “You must do something this time”? – I was not referring to
that at all. I was referring to him getting me something to do, a position of some
sort abroad.

Analysis of Evidence
Let us see what the rest of the letter was. The fourth paragraph is the one that
relates to the incident of your husband waking up and asking you for water as he
was feeling ill. Was that a true incident? – Absolutely true.
Why did you hunt for the prescription? Was that to prevent a similar incident? –
Probably. I did not think it was wise for him to do those things.
Was your anxiety so that you should get hold of the prescription and avert the
catastrophe of taking an overdose? – Yes.
Do you mean you were really frightened about your husband’s overdose? – I was.
Then can you explain to me the meaning of the next sentence –
I told Avis about the incident only I told her as if it frightened and worried me as I
thought perhaps it might be useful at some future time that I had told somebody.
Was it true that you were frightened and worried, or was it acting? – No, that was
true.
You were frightened and worried? – I was.
WhydidyoutakespecialpainstotellAvisasifyouwerefrightenedandworried?–
I was worried and frightened and told my sister.
Why was it likely to be useful to pretend that you were frightened and worried? –
If anything had happened to my husband it would have been much better for
somebody else to know besides myself.
And you thought it would have been much better for you, if you poisoned your
husband, if you professed anxiety to Avis previously? – I had no intention of ever
poisoning my husband.
Look at the next paragraph –
What do you think, darlint. His sister Maggie came in last night and he told her [I
suppose “he” is your husband] so now there are two witnesses, although I wish he
hadn’t told her – but left me to do it.
Now,thatistosayyouwantedagaintocreatetheimpressionthatyouwerefrightened
byyourhusband’sattacks?–Ididnotwanttocreatetheimpression.Iwasfrightened.
It would be so easy darlint – if I had things – I do hope I shall.
What would be easy? – I was asking or saying it would be better if I had things as
Mr. Bywaters suggested I should have.
What would be easy? – To administer them as he suggested.
“I do hope I shall.” Was that acting or was that real? – That was acting for him.
You were acting to Bywaters that you wished to destroy your husband’s life? – I
was.
By Mr. Justice Shearman – One moment, I do not want to be mistaken.
Did I take you down rightly as saying, “I wanted him to think I was willing to take
my husband’s life”? – I wanted him to think I was willing to do what he suggested.
That is to take your husband’s life? – Not necessarily.

Cross-examination continued – To injure your husband at any rate? – To make
him ill.
What was the object of making him ill? – I had not discussed the special
object.
What was in your heart the object of making him ill? So that he should not
recover from his heart attacks? – Yes, that was certainly the impression, yes.
The Court adjourned.
C. Comments
Arguments about the degree of Edith Thompson’s guilt or innocence can never now
be ﬁnally settled. One thing is incontrovertible, i.e. the aura of sexual prejudice (as
palpable as anti-Semitism, apartheid, or any other form of paranoia), which pervaded
the court when she was tried. Even her co-defendant Bywaters may have been an
indirect victim of it. He was presented as the helpless prey of an evil woman and in
that role attracted some sympathy; but if murder had been done his was undoubt-
edly the hand that committed it. Thus the people who were determined that Edith
should swing for it could not have got her without getting him too. (Elaine Morgan
(1979))
Age is eternally jealous of youth; impotence is jealous of passion; law is jealous of
liberty; those who have found happiness within the pale are apt to look with suspicion
and misgiving on those who dare to seek and ﬁnd happiness without the pale. Intellect
affects to despise emotion; yet a real and deep emotion, however wayward, is a more
vital thing than are the sterile and negative barriers within which, necessarily, but in
vain, the social state tries to conﬁne it. That is why we have Courts of law, for a world
ruled only by emotion would be a dreadful place. The lesson of it all surely is never to
let emotion escape from its own sphere, to wander into the dreadful wilderness that
ends in the Court and the prison house. Mr. Justice Shearman frequently referred to
Bywaters as “the adulterer,” apparently quite unconscious of the fact that to people
of Bywaters’s generation, educated in the ethics of dear labour and cheap pleasure, of
commercial sport and the dancing hall, adultery is merely a quaint ecclesiastical term
for what seems to them the great romantic adventure of their lives. Adultery to such
people may or may not be “sporting,” but its wrongness is not a matter that would
trouble them for a moment. Sinai, for them, is wrapped in impenetrable cloud. And if
we are not prepared to adapt the laws of Sinai to the principles of the night club and
the th´e dansant, I see no other alternative but to educate again our young in the eternal
verities on which the law is based. (Filson Young (1951))
No one can say
That the trial was not fair. The trial was fair, Painfully fair by every rule of law,
And that it was made not the slightest difference. The law’s our yardstick, and it
measures well.
Or well enough when there are yards to measure. Measure a wave with it, measure
a ﬁre, Cut sorrow up in inches, weigh content. You can weigh John Brown’s body

(Who am I? At what stage(s) in what process am I? What am I trying to do?)
4
(a) Identify six signiﬁcantly different standpoints for a Wigmorean analysis of
Bywaters and Thompson.
(b) Before starting on the exercise, state what you would expect to be the main
differences in the analysis of the case from each of the six different standpoints.
(c) Which, if any, of the standpoints insures a whole-hearted commitment to truth?

decision to proceed on Indictment No. 1?
(b) From the standpoint of the defense, were there any additional questions of
substantive law that needed to be resolved in order to prepare the defense?
(c) From the standpoint of the historian, are there issues of substantive law on which
you would need advice in order to do a thorough analysis of the evidence in
relation to the question: Was Edith responsible for the death of Percy?

to prove (a) that Frederick Bywaters murdered Percy Thompson? (b) that the speciﬁc
attack was premeditated? Both?

(b) Identify two or three themes that would be suitable in presenting and supporting
each theory at the trial.
9 Outline the main hypotheses favoring the prosecution and those favoring the defense
that an historian might want to analyze in light of the evidence available in terms of
the concepts presented here. How might these differ from the theories of the case of
each side?
E. The chart method: application and appraisal
10 (a) Was it (i) necessary (ii) sufﬁcient with respect to the charge of murder for the
prosecution to prove attempted murder by poison or broken glass (Counts 4 and
5 of Indictment No. 2) on prior occasions? To what issue(s) in respect of the
charge of murder are such allegations relevant?
(b) Construct a key-list and chart of the prosecution’s main theories of the case.
(c) Construct a key-list and chart of the defense’s argument in relation to the
proposition: “Freddy’s attack on Percy was premeditated.” Is this an example of a
“jugular” argument?
11 What “aids” or techniques of textual interpretation are helpful in analyzing the letters
in Bywaters and Thompson?
12 Compile a key-list and chart of propositions in respect of the following passages:
(a) Exhibit 60: “Don’t forget what we talked in the Tea Room . . . Try and help.”
(b) Exhibit 15: “It would be so easy Darlint – if I had things – I do hope I shall. How
about cigarettes?”
(c) Exhibit 19: “I was buoyed up with the hope of the ‘light bulb’ and I used a
lot. . . . I wish oh I wish I could do something.”
(d) Exhibit 17. All the potentially signiﬁcant statements.
13 (a) In relation to Exhibit 17 (above, page 188) Ren´e Weis wrote:
That this piece of fantasy could ever be construed as part of a premeditated
murder plot deﬁes belief. Bywaters knew it was a ﬁction and that she had
herself tasted the quinine in the tea to be able to give an accurate account of
Percy’s complaint. In the court the jurors were told that “the passage is full of
crime”. Yes, as long as it is understood that “crime” means “imaginary crime”.
It is never easy to separate fact and ﬁction in Edith’s extensive and intense
correspondence, and though outside evidence is available to help distinguish
one from the other, the more intimately acquainted the reader becomes with
the correspondence, the more complex its rash interweaving of fact and ﬁction
is bound to appear. In most of our lives blurring is not uncommon. It is not
always harmless. But it is seldom the matter of life and death into which it
developed here. (Weis (2001: 105). Compare Rethinking at 316–18.)
Construct an argument to show that this letter is relevant evidence to support at
least one important probandum.
(b) A pin-hole has been noticed at the top of Exhibit 17, but no attachment has been
found. Has this any evidentiary potential?

H. Other dimensions
19 In the story of Bywaters and Thompson, viewed as a total process involving a ﬂow of
decisions and events, what in your view were crucial decisions, especially mistaken
decisions, made by each of the main protagonists?
20 A group of supporters of Edith Thompson is planning to petition the English
Criminal Cases Review Commission to reconsider her conviction. Leaving aside the
issue whether this case happened too long ago, an important element in such a
review would be whether there is signiﬁcant new evidence to render the conviction
unsafe. Use your imagination to identify what kinds of new evidence might be
helpful in this context, if it were available.
21 The Lord Chief Justice stated in regard to the route followed by the Thompsons on the
evening of October 3: “It was an indirect way from the station to the house.” (above,
page 166). There is nothing in the record of the trial to support this statement, which
is contradicted by contemporary maps and by the fact that the Thompsons were not
alone in taking this route. So this appears to be an invented “fact.” What is the
signiﬁcance, if any, of this point? Could this count as “new evidence”?
22 To what extent did prevailing attitudes toward women play an important part in the
story?
23 After observing her and talking with her over several weeks after her conviction, the
prison governor of Holloway was convinced of Edith Thompson’s innocence. Assess
the value of such evidence from the point of view (a) of an historian (b) of the Home
Secretary, considering clemency.

Evaluating evidence
A. Introduction
The preceding chapters focused upon the logic of proof and methods for analyzing
evidence in a variety of contexts – for example, analyzing the evidence in an ongoing
investigationorinadecidedcaseorinpreparingfortrial.Itshouldbeclear,however,
that developing the strongest theory of a case and determining how the evidence
can best be marshaled to support a probandum necessarily requires that the analyst
make evaluative judgments. So far, we have not directly addressed the problems
of or techniques for evaluating the probative value of evidence or the strength or
cogency of arguments about particular aspects of the evidence or about the evidence
in a case-as-a-whole. This chapter and the next focus upon those problems and
techniques.
A lawyer must confront the problems at every stage of a case. For instance, in a
civil case, from the initial interview onward, the lawyer must assess the weight and
force of the evidence that is available and that is likely to become available. Should
the case be taken? Filed? Pursued? Is the case ready for trial or is further investigation
or discovery justiﬁed or required? Given the available evidence and the operative
law, should the case be settled and, if so, on what basis? At trial, the questions
concern both the lawyers and the decision-makers. Does the particular evidence
proffered have such probative value that it should be admitted notwithstanding any
improper prejudicial effects that it may have? Is the evidence as a whole sufﬁcient
to warrant submission of the case to a jury? Does the evidence prove the claim to
the required standard? The lawyer must argue and the appropriate decision maker
must decide these questions based upon an assessment of the probative value or
force of the parts or the weight of the whole of the evidence.1 Similar questions arise
in criminal processes from the start of an investigation through trial, appeal, and
beyond.
1 The terms “probative value,” probative force,” and “weight” do not have generally accepted mean-
ings. In this book, “probative value” and “probative force” are used where the discussion focuses
on the value or force of particular items of evidence. “Weight” is used where the discussion focuses
on a mass of evidence.

Evaluating evidence

Questions such as these pose fundamental issues that are of concern to lawyers,
judges, and others interested in the processes by which disputed questions of fact are
adjudicated. A central issue may be stated thus: Do the standards of decision provide
meaningful guidance for those who must apply them in the process or for those
who would appraise the outcome of the process? For lawyers, the question is central
becausethestandardsestablishtheframeworkwithinwhichtheymustadviseclients,
make decisions, and frame arguments to courts and juries. For judges and juries,
the question is central because the standards deﬁne the range of their discretion
and purport to provide meaningful guidance for the exercise of that discretion. For
those concerned with adjudication as an aspect of the judicial system, the question
is central because the operation of the standards in some measure determines the
extent to which the system is or could be viewed as rational and fair.
Standpoint is central for lawyers addressing questions such as these. Lawyers are
the primary decision-makers with respect to questions of procedure and strategy.
The lawyer’s objective must be to decide how to construct arguments that will
persuadeotherdecision-makersthat,fromtheirrespectivestandpoints,thedecision
sought is the decision that they should make. Other decisions must be made or
approved by clients, by opposing counsel and their clients, by arbitrators, by judges,
or by juries. The lawyer’s role varies; it may be to advise or to persuade or negotiate.
Forthatreason,thekindsofquestionsthatalawyermustconsiderinconstructing
arguments to persuade others are extensive. To identify a few: Is the client risk-
adverse, risk-neutral, or risk-preferring? The decision to settle or accept a plea or
try a case is ultimately the client’s not the lawyer’s. In the United States, the lawyer
mustconsiderquestionssuchas:Doesthejudgehavetorunforre-election?Ifso,can
she reasonably be expected to rule against the prosecution and police on important
issues or on a regular basis? Is the judge a federal judge appointed for life who can
make unpopular decisions without worrying about her position or livelihood. If so,
does she have ambitions to be promoted to the court of appeal or to be appointed to
highofﬁceintheexecutivebranch?Whatgeneralizationsarethejurorsselectedlikely
to hold and which generalizations can the jury as a whole be persuaded to accept
in evaluating the evidence and the competing stories constructed by the lawyers?
In England the questions are less obvious, but the lawyer must still consider the
background of the decision-makers.
In this chapter, we establish a framework that lawyers (or others) might use in
addressing questions such as these at all stages of a case. In Part B, we describe
techniques for evaluating and constructing arguments about the weight or the
probative value of evidence. That part describes the traditional vocabularies that
lawyers and judges use in expressing their views on the probative value of particular
segments of the evidence or on the weight of the evidence as a whole. In Part C, we
examine standards for decision, standards for pretrial decisions that lawyers and
clients must make, and standards for decisions in adjudication. Those standards
provide the framework within which arguments about the probative value or weight
of the available evidence must be constructed and resolved. Those standards guide

Analysis of Evidence
lawyers in evaluating evidence and framing arguments to persuade others that the
available evidence measured by the applicable standard compels the decision the
lawyer seeks.
B. Evaluating the weight and probative force of evidence
1. No rules of weight
Until recently most legal scholars have accepted the view that evaluation of evi-
dence can rarely be governed by rules. That view can be traced to the earliest views
expressed by theorists of evidence through the present day. For example, if Jeremy
Bentham had had his way, there would have been no binding rules of evidence at
all:
To ﬁnd infallible rules for evidence, rules which insure a just decision, is, from the
nature of things, absolutely impossible; but the human mind is too apt to establish
rules which only increase the probabilities of a bad decision. All the service that an
impartial investigator of the truth can perform in this respect is to put legislators and
judges on their guard against such hasty rules.2 (J. Bentham (1825) 180)
Bentham’s views have not prevailed. But his “anti-nomian” thesis has been much
more successful than is generally acknowledged. With only a few exceptions, there
is an almost total absence of formal regulation in respect of evaluating evidence
or, to put it differently, the Anglo-American law of evidence has almost no rules
of weight. Thayer’s statement of the predominant view would be accepted by most
courts and scholars today:
The judicial ofﬁce is really one of administration . . . While these are some of the chief
characteristics of legal reasoning, it will be noticed that they are only, in the nature
of them, so many reasonable accommodations of the general process to particular
subject-matters and particular aims. Amidst them all the great characteristics of the
art of reasoning and the laws of thought still remain constant. As regards the main
methods in hand, they are still those untechnical ways of all sound reasoning, of the
logical process in its normal and ordinary manifestations; and the rules that govern
it here are the general rules that govern it everywhere, the ordinary rules of human
thought and human experience, to be sought in the ordinary sources, and not in law
books. (Thayer (1898) 274–75)
Wigmore was even more explicit on this issue:
The rules of Admissibility have nothing to say concerning the weight of evidence when
once admitted. The relative weight of circumstantial and testimonial evidence, there-
fore, does not present itself in this place. Indeed, it can be said that there are no rules,
2 The nearest he ever came to qualifying this view is in the following passage: “To take the business
out of the hands of instinct, to subject it to rules, is a task which, if it lies within the reach of human
faculties, must at any rate be reserved, I think, for the improved powers of some maturer age.”
(Bentham (1827) vol. 1, 44)

in our system of Evidence, prescribing for the jury the precise effect of any general or
special class of evidence. So far as logic and psychology assist us, their conclusions show
that it is out of the question to make a general assertion ascribing greater weight to one
class or the other. The probative effect of one or more pieces of either sort of evidence
depends upon considerations too complex. Science can only point out that each class
has its special dangers and its special advantages. (1 Wigmore on Evidence §26 (Tillers
Rev. 1983))
To say that there are no rules of weight means that the law does not prescribe
generalrulesconcerningtheweightorcogencyofparticulartypesofevidencesuchas
confessions, eyewitness identiﬁcation evidence, or ﬁngerprints. There are, however,
ways in which some limited control is exercised over evaluation of evidence. For
example, in many common law jurisdictions a judge has a duty to warn the trier
of fact about the potential unreliability of eyewitness identiﬁcation evidence.3 In
England directions to a jury may include advice on evaluation of certain phases
of the evidence and such guidance is sometimes included in specimen directions
prepared by the Judicial Studies Board. Judges may withdraw a case from a jury on
the grounds of insufﬁcient evidence (see below). Bentham drew a sharp distinction
between rules addressed to the will (binding) and instructions addressed to the
understanding (guidance). Almost without exception this distinction is maintained
by the law of evidence throughout the common law world.
2. Traditional modes of expressing weight and probative force
There is a useful analogy between grading examinations and evaluating evidence.
One obvious point of similarity has to do with the extent to which both modes of
decision-makingaresusceptibletorationalguidance,justiﬁcation,andcriticism.We
all hope that grading is not a completely arbitrary, irrational, hit-or-miss process;
but few would deny that there is an inescapable personal element at the point
of decision. So with the weighing of evidence. Less obvious is the point that, in
discussing what is involved in the conscientious marking of examinations and the
weighing of evidence, it is important to distinguish among a number of questions.
In examining, we distinguish between conventional modes of expressing marks or
grades (percentage; alphabetical grading; pass/fail); standards required for attaining
a particular result (e.g., the standards for the pass mark, for awarding a distinction
or credit); the criteria used in awarding marks or the reasons for making particular
evaluations(e.g.,marksgivenforaccuracy,originality,orgoodanalysisorsubtracted
for errors, omissions, or even illegibility); how to combine judgments about grades,
especially when they are based on multiple criteria; and the extent to which such
criteria can be embodied in rules.
In evaluating evidence, we need to make some similar distinctions. In partic-
ular we need to distinguish among the following questions, even though they are
intimately related in both theory and practice:

Analysis of Evidence
1 How can we express assessments of weight (the vocabulary of evaluation, analogous to
a marking scheme)?
2 What are the standards for decision of factual issues (cf. the pass mark)?
3 How can judgments of weight and probative force be combined?
4 What are the criteria for evaluating the probative force of individual items of evidence
or the weight of a “mass” of evidence in a given case (cf. reasons for awarding or
debiting marks or awarding a particular overall grade)?
5 To what extent could the law of evidence prescribe rules of weight or evaluation
(cf. marking rules)?
Whatever the possibility of developing principles of evaluation, there is an estab-
lished vocabulary by which degrees of persuasion and probative force are expressed
in forensic and other contexts. It is perhaps noteworthy how little the vocabulary
has changed over the past two centuries.
In the ﬁrst place, it has been observed by a very learned Man, that there are several
Degrees from perfect Certainty and Demonstration, quite down to Improbability and
Unlikeliness, even to the conﬁnes of Impossibility; and there are several Acts of the
Mind proportioned to these degrees of Evidence, which may be called the Degrees of
Assent, from full Assurance and Conﬁdence, quite down to Conjecture, Doubt, Distrust
and Disbelief. (J. Gilbert (1754) 1)
Certainty, absolute certainty, is a satisfaction which on every ground of inquiry we are
continually grasping at, but which the inexorable nature of things has placed forever out
of reach. Practical certainty, a degree of assurance sufﬁcient for practice, is a blessing,
the attainment of which, as often as it lies in our way to attain it, may be sufﬁcient
to console us under the want of any such superﬂuous and unattainable acquisitions.
(Bentham (1827) vol. 5: 351)
In talking about inferences, it is common to resort to metaphor: We talk of the
weight of the evidence, of prejudicial effect outweighing probative value, of the
persuasive force or the probative force of an argument, of the strength of support,
or of a weak case. Yet we do not normally seek to express differences or to measure
such matters in terms of grams or ohms or watts or volts or pounds per square inch
or other physical measures.
There is a variety of contexts in which judgments concerning evidence are com-
monly expressed as probability judgments, although not always identiﬁed as such.
For example, it is common to express probability judgments on a conventional
scale of 0 to 1. Similarly, the strength of a judgment may be expressed in terms of
percentages (e.g., it is 60 percent probable that X is the murderer); or of wagering
odds (e.g., I would bet three to one that X is the murderer). There are also standard
formulations by which beliefs are expressed in subjective (I am conﬁdent that X is
the murderer) or objective (the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that X is
the murderer) terms that connote a probabilistic judgment.
The conventions for marking examinations illustrate, in an analogous context,
some of the concerns that the use of the term “probability” raises. The adoption of a

convention that expresses marks or grades in terms of numbers or Roman or Greek
letters or some other mode of expression (e.g., Excellent – Worthless) tells us little
or nothing of the criteria used for making such judgments. In expressing judgments
about evidence or exam papers, however, using numbers makes it easier, and more
tempting, to add, subtract, multiply, or perform other mathematical calculations to
create an appearance of precision and objectivity; but whether a particular mode of
calculation or whether calculating at all is appropriate are separate questions. Some
of the central debates in the theory of evidence address such questions in respect
to weighing or assessing the probative force of evidence. These controversies are
introducedinChapter9.Inthischapter,weareconcernedwithonlythreequestions:
First,whataretheconventions forexpressingdecisionsorjudgmentsaboutprobative
forceorweight,independentlyofanyparticularcriteria forarrivingatsuchdecisions
or judgments? Second, what are the criteria or standards the decision-maker is to
use in making the required decisions and judgments? Third, what, if any, is the legal
signiﬁcance of the various criteria and standards?
In legal discourse, terms that connote an assessment of probability are com-
monly invoked. Lawyers, judges, and commentators also talk of the credibility of
evidence and of witnesses, of the plausibility of an argument, and of the likelihood
that an event occurred or will occur. In some contexts, such terms are used synony-
mously with probability.4 For purposes of the present chapter, we shall use the term
“probability” in its conventional sense as a general term for expressing judgments
about the probative force and effect of evidence without any necessary commit-
ment to any particular criteria for assessing the correctness of particular judgments
of probability; in short we shall use the term broadly to embrace both “objective”
and “subjective,” mathematical (“Pascalian”) and nonmathematical (“Baconian”),
theories of probability.
Againstthatbackground,onemightconstructa“probabilitytable,”whichgrades
both mathematical and nonmathematical probability judgments on a ten-point
scale.
For different purposes the number of gradations are sometimes increased or
reduced. For example, most English university law faculties express marks in per-
centages, but according to convention the normal range is on a 50-point scale, for
almost no one gets more than 80 percent and only disastrous performances rate
less than 30 percent. A standard alphabetical system of marking along the sequence
A++, A+, A . . . C++, . . . F has approximately 20 gradations, sometimes extended
by the craven insertion of queries (e.g., B-??, B+?+). Some examinations have two
grades: Pass/Fail. In the present context the moral is clear: The mode of expressing
4 For some people, however, the term “probability” is indissolubly associated with certain forms of
mathematical reasoning and calculation so that to them it seems paradoxical, even heretical, to
talk of “nonmathematical probabilities.” In this view, it may be perfectly acceptable to claim that
it is inappropriate to quantify the plausibility of an argument, the criminal standard of proof, the
credibility of a witness, or the likelihood of some claim being true (though this is, perhaps, more

of being expressed numerically. These views are discussed in Ch. 9.

judgments concerning degrees of probative force is usually a matter of convention,
in which there is no magic in the numbers.
The moral for lawyers and law students should be clear. Judges and juries must
in some way “grade” the evidence each time they are required to make an evaluative
decisionconcerningevidence,whetherthedecisiontakestheformofajudge’sdecid-
ing whether the improper prejudicial effect substantially outweighs the probative
value of proffered evidence or the jury’s deciding whether the evidence establishes
the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt or whether it shows that the plain-
tiff’s ultimate probandum is more probable than not. In practice, these judgments
are ordinarily expressed on a binary scale – evidence is admitted or not admitted,
objections are sustained or overruled, the jury’s verdict is guilty or not guilty, for
the plaintiff in a speciﬁc amount or for the defendant. Nonetheless, both judges
and juries are expected to weigh the evidence in terms of probabilistic assessments
of the probative force of the parts and of the whole. For that reason, lawyers must
know and be able to frame their arguments using the conventional vocabularies by
which such arguments and judgments are expressed.
C. Standards for decision
Traditional works on the law of evidence tend to focus on the contested jury trial and
the standards of proof that are applicable to adjudicative decisions at ﬁrst instance,
notably the civil standard (balance of probabilities, preponderance of evidence) and

the criminal standard (proof beyond reasonable doubt). These are, of course, very
important. However, if one adopts a total process model of litigation that involves a
variety of speciﬁc decisions by different participants pre-trial and post-trial, as well
as at trial, other standards for decision also need to be considered.
Adjudicative decisions are indeed a focal point of litigation, both because they are
important in themselves and because they “cast a long shadow” on other decisions
thatprecedeorcomeafterthem.Forexample,adecisiontoprosecuteortopleadnot
guilty must take into account the likelihood of a decision to acquit or convict by the
trier of fact. This in turn requires an assessment of the net persuasive effect that the
evidence would be likely to have on the trier of fact. Similarly, many post-conviction
decisions have to treat the decision of the trier of fact as given or, exceptionally, to
consider whether it should be overturned. Nevertheless, it is important to bear in
mind that both analysis and evaluation are typically involved in all these decisions
and that evaluation is typically governed by different standards with respect to the
different kinds of decisions that must be made.
In this context, there are three propositions that should be axiomatic. First,
there are accepted standards that are intended to provide guidance for almost every
decision that requires consideration of evidence in a legal context. Second, almost
all those decisions require not only that the evidence be analyzed so that potential
logical relationships may be identiﬁed, but also that it be evaluated to determine the
relative strength of the inferences for which it may logically be claimed to provide
some support. Third, however articulated, the standards for decision are usually
framed in terms intended to provide guidance in evaluation as well as analysis.
From the standpoint of the practitioner there is a further distinction that should
be equally axiomatic. The standards for decision can be usefully separated into two
categories. In one category are those standards that are prescribed to impose limits
on the decision-maker’s exercise of discretion; for instance, standards of review such
as whether the evidence was logically sufﬁcient to support the decision below. In
the other category are those standards intended to guide a decision-maker in the
exercise of assigned discretion, such as a standard that the jury must be satisﬁed
beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case. The axioms and the importance of
the distinctions are illustrated in the sections that follow.
1. Lawyering standards
The resolution of any legal dispute may require decisions by at least ﬁve kinds
of decision-makers: the parties (or clients), their lawyers (including prosecutors),
the trial judge, jurors, and appellate judges. There are standards established by
conventional wisdom, ethical norm, or legal rule for virtually every decision that
must be taken at any stage of the process. The purpose of this section is to illustrate
thispointbrieﬂywithreferencetoexamplesoflawyer-clientdecisionsandofpretrial
decisions that are ordinarily made by lawyers.

Analysis of Evidence
a. Standards for lawyer-client decisions
In the common law system of adjudication, clients and lawyers, as well as adjudica-
tors, are decision-makers. Ethical considerations, rules of professional conduct, and
practical realities dictate that there is a variety of decisions in which the lawyer and
the client must participate; these rules identify decisions on which the lawyer must
ordinarily defer to the client. Many of these decisions depend signiﬁcantly upon
an assessment of the state of the known evidence and its probable effect upon the
decision-maker, such as a defendant’s decision to accept a proposed plea bargain or
to waive or to seek or demand a trial by jury.
In civil cases, lawyers ordinarily apply some rather straightforward utilitarian
standards in making decisions about whether a claim should be pursued, settled,
or abandoned. Many of these decisions require that the available and potentially
available evidence be evaluated in order to assess the likelihood that one party will
prevail on liability questions and the probable value to that party of the damages or
other relief that would be awarded if liability is established. These determinations
must then be balanced against the potential risks and probable costs involved in
pursuing the claim.
Standards for deciding whether to undertake a case and whether and on what
basis to settle it may illustrate the point. Decision theorists and economists have
tried to develop utilitarian standards that they argue should serve to guide lawyers
and clients in evaluating and settling a legal dispute. A simpliﬁed approach might
be stated as follows:
Most cases should be settled, and the decision to take, prosecute, or settle a case can
be reduced to a simple set of formulae that should be commonplace among lawyers. In
almost every instance, there are only four variables that need be considered – the state
of the law, the state of the evidence, the amount or value of the possible recovery, and
the legal fees and costs likely to be incurred in achieving the result. At any time during a
case, the lawyer’s assessment of the probability that the court will apply a speciﬁc rule of
law and of the probability that the then available evidence will persuade the fact-ﬁnder
to impose liability upon the defendant under that rule provide a basis for calculating the
probability that liability, “PL,” will be imposed. The elements or heads of damages as a
matter of law and the evidence available to prove the amount of damages recoverable
in the particular case should sufﬁce to enable a competent lawyer similarly to assess the
probable amount of the anticipated damage award, “PD,” at any stage. What is left is for
the lawyer for each side to estimate the legal costs and fees, “CF,” likely to be required,
from that point forward, to litigate the matter to conclusion. This information should
sufﬁce to enable the lawyers for each side to make a reasoned assessment of the probable
value of the case, “PV,” at any stage.
In their simplest form, these decisions can be expressed for American litigation as
follows:
For plaintiff:
PV = (PL × PD) – CF
(as assessed by plaintiff and his or her
counsel)

Evaluating evidence
233
For defendant:
PV = (PL × PD) + CF
(as assessed by defendant and his or
her counsel)
Although mathematics provides tools of sufﬁcient sophistication to deal with more
variables and may provide greater sophistication in reaching decisions, basic principles
for evaluating the typical case can be simply devised and might be expressed as follows:
1. In ordinary circumstances, no lawyer should undertake a case for a potential plaintiff
unless PV > 0 by an amount sufﬁcient to compensate for the fact that the client will
lose the estimated amount of the costs and fees and for the costs and burdens
(economic and psychological) incidental to pursuing the claim.
2. In ordinary circumstances, cases should be settled whenever the sum of the future
costs and fees to both sides exceeds the difference between the probable values as
assessed by the clients and their respective lawyers, or whenever:
[PL × PD (plaintiff)] – [PL × PD (defendant)] ≤CF (pff) + CF (def)
If lawyers understood simple decision analysis, there might be fewer trials, wealthier
clients, and the economy would have eliminated substantial transaction costs.
Questions
1 The standards above are offered to guide lawyers (and clients) in the exercise of
discretion. What, if any, standards deﬁne the limits of that discretion?
2 Review Sargent v. Southern Accident Company (page 28).
a What factors should a lawyer have considered in deciding whether she should
undertake to represent the Sargent family? Should it have made a difference, from
her standpoint, whether she ordinarily charged an hourly rate or a contingent
(percentage of recovery) fee for her services? Assuming either arrangement was
permissible and was agreeable to the Sargent family, how should the lawyer have
decided which method of charging was preferable? Which of the factors that she
should have considered require an assessment of the evidence as it bore upon the
probable outcome of the case?
b From the standpoint of the Sargent family, what advice should they have required
from the lawyer before deciding whether to pursue the claim or to retain this
speciﬁc lawyer for the matter? Suppose the lawyer advised that her ﬁrm would
undertake the matter for actual costs (deposition transcripts, ﬁling fees, etc.) plus
either a standard hourly billing rate of $200 an hour or a contingent fee of thirty
percent (30%) of the amount recovered? If the Sargents liked the lawyer, how
should they have proceeded to decide upon the fee? What legal or ethical duties
would the lawyer have in advising the Sargents with respect to this decision?
c Assume (1) that the lawyers representing the Sargents had agreed to represent
them for a fee of $200 an hour plus any amounts expended for costs and the ﬁrm
representing the insurance company had agreed to represent it for a fee of $150 an
hour plus any amounts expended for costs; (2) that the Sargents have paid their
lawyers $20,000 in fees and $10,000 for costs to date and that the insurance

company paid their lawyers $15,000 in fees and $10,000 for costs to date; (3) (i) that
the lawyers for the Sargents have estimated that they will need to spend 60 more
hours to prepare and try the case and that the costs from this point through the end
of the trial will be about $8,000 and (ii) that the lawyers for the insurance company
have given similar estimates of the fees and costs to be incurred if the case is
tried.
i How should the claims supervisor have proceeded to decide upon the maximum
amount the company should offer to settle the case before trial? What strategy
would you have employed as counsel for the company to achieve a successful
settlement?
ii How should the Sargents have decided on the minimum amount they would
accept to settle the case? What strategy would you have employed as counsel for
the Sargents to achieve a successful settlement?
d How would the formulae for deciding to take or settle a case differ under a system
that requires the losing party to pay the winning party’s legal costs and fees (“the
costs follow the event”)? In view of this analysis, what policies are furthered by
each of the systems?
b. Standards for lawyers’ decisions
The signiﬁcance of lawyer decisions and the extent to which these decisions are
subject to standards are matters that are not frequently analyzed in books on evi-
dence or trial practice. Ordinarily it is the lawyers who effectively direct the course
of pre-trial pleading and discovery. By their discovery decisions, lawyers have the
power to impose burdens on or to frustrate the legitimate objectives of the adverse
party to the litigation. Similarly, lawyers have the power to impose signiﬁcant bur-
dens on the court as well as on the adverse party through their decisions concerning
which motions should be ﬁled and how vigorously each should be documented
and pursued. In the United States, there is substantial literature and other evidence
suggesting that lawyers involved in large cases use these powers for reasons that
may be largely unrelated to achieving a prompt and fair adjudication of a disputed
claim.5 Some examples should illustrate the point.
(i) The decision to ﬁle a complaint
The range of a lawyer’s discretion in ﬁling a complaint (or other pleading) in a civil
case has been the subject of extensive litigation in the United States. Lawyers are the
ofﬁcers of the court who make the ﬁnal decision to ﬁle a civil complaint. American
law prescribes standards (either directly or through the rules of the profession)
that they are required to apply in deciding whether to initiate a case and, if so, what
allegations may properly be made in an initial or subsequent pleading. For example,
Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Procedure in the United States provides:
5 See, e.g., John D. Shugrue, “Identifying and Combating Discovery Abuse,” 23 Litigation No. 2
(Fall 1997) 10 (for an illustration and description); see also Symposium Conference on Discovery,
39 Boston Coll. L. Rev. (1998) 517–840 (for a more comprehensive overview).

Rule 11 – Signing of Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers; Representations to Court;
Sanctions
(a) Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper shall be signed by at
least one attorney of record in the attorney’s individual name, or, if the party is not
represented by an attorney, shall be signed by the party. Each paper shall state the
signer’s address and telephone number, if any. Except when otherwise speciﬁcally
provided by rule or statute, pleadings need not be veriﬁed or accompanied by
afﬁdavit. An unsigned paper shall be stricken unless omission of the signature is
corrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or party.
(b) Representations to Court. By presenting to the court (whether by signing, ﬁl-
ing, submitting, or later advocating) a pleading, written motion, or other paper,
an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying that to the best of the person’s
knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the
circumstances, –
(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to
cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost;
(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by
existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modiﬁcation, or
reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law;
(3) the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
speciﬁcally so identiﬁed, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable
opportunity for further investigation or discovery; and
(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specif-
ically so identiﬁed, are reasonably based on a lack of information or belief.
(c) Sanctions. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court
determines that subdivision (b) has been violated, the court may, subject to the
conditions stated below, impose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law
ﬁrms,orpartiesthathaveviolatedsubdivision(b)orareresponsiblefortheviolation.
ii. The decision to prosecute
Section9-27.220.AoftheUnitedStatesJusticeDepartment’sUnitedStatesAttorneys’
Manual speciﬁes the standard that should be observed in deciding whether to
prosecute:
TheattorneyforthegovernmentshouldcommenceorrecommendFederalprosecution
if he/she believes that the person’s conduct constitutes a Federal offense and that the
admissible evidence will probably be sufﬁcient to obtain and sustain a conviction,
unless, in his/her judgment, prosecution should be declined because:
1. No substantial Federal interest would be served by prosecution;
2. The person is subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction; or
3. There exists an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution.
The standard in England and Wales is similar. Under The Code for Crown
Prosecutors,6 there are two tests which must be satisﬁed before a prosecution is

Analysis of Evidence
initiated – the evidential test and the public interest test. The two are summarized
in sections 5.1 and 6.2 of the Code.
5.1 Crown Prosecutors must be satisﬁed that there is enough evidence to provide a
‘realistic prospect of conviction’ against each defendant on each charge. They must
consider what the defence case may be, and how that is likely to affect the prosecution
case.
. . .
6.2 The public interest must be considered in each case where there is enough evidence
to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. A prosecution will usually take place unless
there are public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh
those tending in favour. Although there may be public interest factors against prose-
cution in a particular case, often the prosecution should go ahead and those factors
should be put to the court for consideration when sentence is being passed.
Both sets of standards are clearly written as guides to the exercise of discretion.
The legal limits of that discretion are unclear.
iii. Other pre-trial decisions
A further aspect of lawyers’ decisions should be considered. There is frequently a
tension between the lawyer’s duties to the client (e.g., to pursue the client’s objective
zealously within the bounds of the law) and the lawyer’s duties to the court and
to opposing counsel and their clients (e.g., not to assert claims or take actions
for purposes of delay). The duty to the client is likely to push the lawyer to ignore
standardsintendedtoguidediscretion,suchasthe“goodfaithbasisinfact”standard,
and to exercise discretion in favor of the client unless satisﬁed that the exercise
violates the standard establishing legal limits in a manner that is likely to be detected
and result in sanctions or other adverse consequences.
For example, in 1969, the United States and, later, several private parties ﬁled sep-
arate civil actions alleging that International Business Machines Company (“IBM”)
had violated various provisions of the antitrust laws. A few years later, IBM’s chair-
man is reported to have quipped that IBM’s Vice President for Legal Affairs had the
only ofﬁce with an unlimited budget, and that he had already over-spent it. IBM and
its law ﬁrm are reported to have assigned more than 20 lawyers to the case and to
have instructed them that every debatable issue was to be litigated to the maximum
extent permitted by law. Pre-trial motions and discovery took six years. The trial
on liability alone lasted more than six additional years. After 12 years and a change
in the administration, the Justice Department dropped its suit, stipulating it was
“without merit.” Most of the private plaintiffs were unable to pursue their claims
successfully. In one view, decisions by IBM and its lawyers to pursue every point to
the maximum and the resulting delays ultimately controlled the outcome.7 What
standards other than costs can or should be applied to limit lawyers’ discretion in
7 See Watson and Petre (1990) 376–89 (for a description from the client’s standpoint).

making decisions in litigation? This ethical tension is apparent in many decisions
lawyers must make.
Questions
1 Does Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure establish standards intended to
guide the lawyer in her exercise of discretion or standards designed to conﬁne the
limits of that discretion? Does the rule provide a clear standard governing a judge’s
decision to impose sanctions or merely standards designed to aid the judge in the
exercise of discretion?
2 The standards established to guide prosecutors in deciding whether a prosecution
should be initiated are, by their terms, intended as guides to the exercise of discretion.
What standards should deﬁne the limits of that discretion and who should have
authority to enforce them?
2. Standards for decisions in adjudication

the judge to resolve disputes concerning the admissibility of evidence. At the close of
the evidence, counsel will attempt to persuade the fact-ﬁnder that the evidence does
or does not satisfy the prescribed standard and requires a verdict favorable to his or
her client. Generally, the loser may appeal to a higher court claiming that errors by
the trial judge or jury in applying the standards for assessing the parts or the whole
of the evidence require outright reversal or at least a new trial. In this section, we
discuss the signiﬁcance of the standards governing adjudicative decisions such as
these.
a. Standards for decisions disposing of a case as a matter of law
Prior to trial the parties to a case may ask the court to dispose of the case as a
matter of law on the ground that there are no disputed facts the resolution of which
could affect the outcome. A defendant may move to dismiss the complaint on the
ground that the facts alleged, if true, do not state a claim for which the law provides
a remedy. In a civil case, either party may move for judgment on the pleadings on
the ground that the facts alleged or admitted in the pleadings, when viewed most
favorably to the opposing party, establish as a matter of law that the relief must be
or cannot properly be granted. At any time prior to a civil trial, with the additional
evidence obtained through discovery or presented by afﬁdavit, either party may ask
the court to grant summary judgment on the ground that the then existing state of
the record establishes that no fact material to a determination of the outcome as a
matter of law is subject to any genuine dispute.
Each of these motions asserts a claim that there is no factual dispute to be
resolvedandthatallfactsnecessarytoaﬁnalapplicationoftheproperlegalprinciple

Analysis of Evidence
are admitted or have been placed beyond reasonable challenge. The standard for
decision on such motions is whether the claimant is right: If there are no material
facts in dispute, the court should ﬁnally dispose of the case by applying the correct
principle of law.8
At various stages in a trial, the judge may be asked to terminate the proceedings
and rule in favor of one of the parties. When the prosecution or the plaintiff has
ﬁnished presenting evidence and has rested, the defendant may ask the trial court
to rule that the evidence is insufﬁcient to support a conviction or a judgment for
the plaintiff. When the defendant has rested, either the defendant or, in a civil case,
the plaintiff may ask the court to rule either that the evidence is insufﬁcient or that
it points so overwhelmingly in one party’s favor that there is no reason to proceed
further.
The standard that the trial judge is to apply again requires a determination
whether any fact material to the outcome is subject to genuine dispute. A motion
attackingthesufﬁciencyoftheevidenceasksthecourttodeterminethattheevidence
is so slight that no rational trier of fact could reach a favorable conclusion to the
degree of certainty required by the applicable standard of proof. A motion asking
for a directed verdict or an early judgment on other grounds asks the court to
determine that the evidence is so weak or, in a civil case, so overwhelming that
under the applicable standard of proof rational fact-ﬁnders could not disagree on
the correct result.
In theory, an appellate court applies the same standard and need not accord any
deference or special weight to the trial judge’s decision on such claims. The appellate
court, so the theory goes, is as capable as the trial court in identifying and applying
the correct legal principle, and as capable as the trial court in determining whether
the evidence left room for rational debate as to any fact necessary to the judgment
reached.9 The important points, for present purposes, are two. Logical analysis is
a necessary condition to effective argument. It is not, however, a sufﬁcient basis
either for argument or for predicting or explaining decisions.
b. Standards for decisions on admissibility
We address the relationship between the principles of proof and the law of evidence
in Chapter 11. It should be apparent, however, that many rules of evidence are
standards intended to guide the trial judge in exercising her discretion in deciding
whether evidence should be admitted or its use limited.
One of the basic principles underlying the rules and deﬁning the extent of the
judge’s discretion under those rules is that a judge should exclude evidence whose
8 In theory, this involves no discretion, and an appellate court applies the same standard in assessing
the trial court’s decision, but cases such as Robinson v. Diamond Housing Corp., 267 A.2d 833 (D.C.
Ct. App. 1970), and Robinson v. Diamond Housing Corp., 463 F.2d 853 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (reversing
the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals) make it clear that there is an element of
discretion involved even here.
9 As the Diamond decisions in the trial court and on appeal illustrate, the extent to which appellate
practice conforms to established theory is at least open to debate.

improper prejudicial effects substantially outweigh its legitimate probative value.
Precise analysis of the inferences that a particular item of evidence might support is
necessarytoidentifybothitsimproperprejudicialeffectsanditslegitimateprobative
value.
How should a Wigmorean lawyer approach the task of identifying and arguing
the probative value and prejudicial effects that the court should consider in deciding
whether particular evidence should be admitted or excluded? The ﬁrst step in the
equation requires identiﬁcation of the inferences that are claimed to give the evi-
dencelegitimateprobativevalue.Thesecondrequiresidentiﬁcationoftheimproper
prejudicial effects that the evidence may have. The results of this analysis establish
the framework for arguments about whether the improper prejudicial effects sub-
stantially outweigh the legitimate probative value of the evidence in the context of
this case.
Establishing probative value begins with analysis. To what fact of consequence
in the litigation is the proffered evidential data relevant? The kind of analysis and
its importance in this context may be illustrated by an example drawn from United
States v. Richard Able.10 Given the parties’ respective theories, the only penultimate
probanda open to dispute were:
5 At the time the 2003 return was ﬁled, RA knew that the 2003 return was false.
8 At the time the 2003 return was ﬁled, RA intended to defraud the government of the
taxes due and owing on $45,000.
The prosecution would seek to introduce as part of its evidence the cancelled
check for $25,000 issued by the law ﬁrm to Able with endorsements showing it was
cashed at a Citibank branch in Las Vegas. Its relevance is clear. The cancelled check
shows that Able received $25,000 on December 20, 2002, and that this amount
was income. That check combined with evidence showing the salary Able received
from the law school and the two other checks combine to support an inference that
Able received $170,000 income during 2002 ($125,000 salary, $25,000 from the Law
Firm, and $20,000 from other consulting work) – one of the penultimate probanda
the government must prove. This analysis, at least provisionally, also establishes
that the probative value of the evidence is high: Absent evidence of forgery or the
like, the cancelled check would appear to establish, and to be necessary to establish,
a central fact of consequence to something approaching a certainty.
The government would also claim that the endorsement made the check relevant
to motive. On its face, the claim is plausible. The number of the steps in the chain of
inferences necessary to demonstrate that relevance makes it clear that its probative
value with respect to motive is slight (page 129).
In the face of that analysis, what bases would be open to counsel for Able to object
topermittingthejurytoseetheendorsementonthecheck?Theanalysisnecessaryto

provide proper bases for arguments opposing the admission of particular evidence.
The key is identifying effects that the law identiﬁes as improper.11

for Able. The endorsement showing that Able cashed the check on December 20 in
Las Vegas supports a number of inferences:
Able cashed a large check in Las Vegas, therefore Able was a gambler, therefore Able is
a risk taker.
The amount of the check supports an inference that Able stayed at a fancy hotel and
gambling casino, therefore Able is a high liver.
Only ﬁve days before Christmas, Able cashed a check in a city built for gamblers and
in a state which has legalized prostitution, therefore Able is not the kind of person
who respects the traditional ways of celebrating an important family and Christian
holiday.
Depending upon the views represented in the jury, any or all of these inferences
could be damaging to Able. At the same time, an inference that Able was a gambler
and a high liver, in light of his income for the year, supports a chain of inferences
pointing toward motive and hence to knowledge and intent. Are these inferences
in any way improper?
The argument that they are unfairly prejudicial stems from the policies that
underlie the rules governing character evidence. Although casino gambling may be
legal in Las Vegas, it is likely to be viewed as a character defect in states where it
is illegal (including the hypothetical New State), supporting an inference that Able
is a bad person. So too, gambling may be regarded as establishing a propensity to
take risks, and the jury might infer that Able’s propensity to take risks made it likely
that he took the risk of ﬁling a false tax return to defraud the government. These
inferences have some logical force, but they conﬂict with the policies of individuated
justice that underlie the character evidence rule. Able is not on trial for gambling
or high living, and the jury’s deliberations may be unfairly prejudiced or the issues
confused if this evidence is admitted.
This analysis has identiﬁed some prejudicial effects that are improper. The stan-
dard formulation of the rule, however, would require that Able’s counsel persuade
11 It should be clear that any evidence that supports one side of a dispute should ordinarily have an

This is misleading because, absent other factors, there is nothing improper about these effects.

the trial judge that the danger created by improper prejudicial effects substantially
outweighs the legitimate probative value of the law ﬁrm’s check, which directly
supports, and is probably the strongest evidence with respect to, an element of the
offense – the amount of income Able received in 2002.
Assume that Linda Davis had died before the trial and that Able’s counsel agreed
to stipulate to the fact that Able received $25,000 from the law ﬁrm in 2002 and,
if desired, to stipulate to the admission of a copy of the front of the check with a
further stipulation that Able cashed it in December 2002. In that case, Able’s lawyer
couldpersuasivelyarguethattheidentiﬁedimproperprejudicialeffectssubstantially
outweigh any legitimate probative value of the endorsement with respect to motive,
and the argument would have considerable force.13
The example has isolated a piece of evidence and analyzed it apart from the case
as a whole. Assume that Linda Davis had not died and was available at trial. In
that situation, it should be apparent that an assessment of the arguments about the
endorsement would depend upon Linda Davis’s testimony. If Davis, for example,
testiﬁed that Able took her to Las Vegas for a gambling spree and that the two
did gamble heavily and lost and spent most of the balance of the $25,000 enjoying
Las Vegas’s other attractions, the prosecution’s argument for admission would be
far stronger. If, on the other hand, Davis proffers testimony consistent with Able’s
report of the events to his counsel, Able’s lawyer may have a strong argument to
exclude much of Davis’s testimony as well as the endorsement.14
Three points deserve emphasis. First, an assessment of the probative value of an
item of evidence requires a precise identiﬁcation and analysis of each of the inferen-
tial steps necessary to relate it to a fact of consequence. Second, an identiﬁcation and
appraisal of the possible improper prejudicial effects ordinarily requires a similar
analysis. Third, the analysis must examine the particular evidence in the context of
the case as a whole. A Wigmorean chart demonstrates at a minimum that the bits of
evidence in a case are so interconnected that decisions with respect to a particular
item of evidence may have a signiﬁcant effect on the whole. A blown fuse is going
to affect more than the socket that caused it to blow.
So far the analysis has focused upon arguments designed to persuade the trial
judgetosustainanobjectionclaimingthattheprejudicialeffectsoftheendorsement
substantially outweighed their probative value. Even with this rather detailed analy-
sis, would a decision by the trial judge overruling either or both objections be likely
to cause an appellate court to overrule the judgment were Able convicted? If the
13 Perhaps such force that a refusal by the trial court to accept to exclude the evidence would exceed
the limits of the broad discretion conferred upon her by Rule 403. See Old Chief v. United States,
519 U.S. 172 (1997).
14 If Able’s counsel succeeds in persuading the court to exclude the endorsement from evidence
during the prosecution’s case, the question could arise again if Able took the stand. If Able were to
testify to facts supporting an argument that he was a ﬁscally and socially conservative individual,
the prosecutor would likely re-offer the endorsement on rebuttal, arguing that Able’s testimony
had opened the door and placed his character in issue and had made the credibility of his assertions
facts of consequence in the litigation and that the re-offered evidence had thus obtained a probative
value that could no longer be successfully disputed.

trial judge were to sustain both objections, and if Able were found not guilty by
the jury, the prosecution could not appeal and thus could not even challenge the
decisions. The message is, if the lawyer does not win it at trial, it is highly unlikely
that she will ever win it.
The analysis also illustrates the distinction between standards for decisions that
serve as guides for the exercise of discretion and those, such as the standards of
review, that deﬁne the limits within which that discretion must be exercised. From
the standpoint of the lawyer, the former are useful primarily as articulations for
framing cogent arguments to persuade the trial judge how discretion should be
exercised; the latter are useful only where the lawyer can satisfy an appellate court
thatthetrialjudgeexceededthelimitsofthediscretionpermitted–arareoccurrence.
c. The case as a whole: burdens of proof and the civil and criminal standards
The distinction brought out by Gilbert between objective degrees of cogency and
subjective degrees of persuasion or belief15 is reﬂected in orthodox discourse about
standards of proof. Thus the ordinary civil standard of proof is typically articulated
in seemingly “objective” terms (“balance of probabilities,” “preponderance of evi-
dence”) while the criminal standard is almost universally expressed in terms of the
state of mind of the trier of fact (“proof beyond reasonable doubt” or “you must
feel sure of the prisoner’s guilt,” as Goddard L.C.J. put it in Regina v. Hepworth
and Fearnley [1955] Q.B. 600, 603).16 The purpose of this section is to raise some
questions about the meaning and role of these standards, how far they can be taken
at face value as clear guides to decisions, and whether the distinction between objec-
tive and subjective criteria is of any practical importance. Chapter 9 addresses the
question whether any or all of these standards can and should be treated as embody-
ing probabilistic notions that are susceptible, at least in theory, to mathematical
calculation.
There are common standards prescribed to guide the fact-ﬁnder in assessing the
evidence as a whole. Under the standard commonly prescribed for civil cases, the
fact-ﬁnder must determine whether the plaintiff has proved all the elements of the
ultimate probandum by a preponderance or on the greater weight of the evidence or
whether, on a balance of probabilities, the elements of the ultimate probandum are
more probably true than not. On the criminal side, the fact-ﬁnder must determine
whether the evidence establishes the elements of the offense and the defendant’s
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. These are the basic standards by which fact-ﬁnders
must evaluate the overall weight of the evidence.
There is an important preliminary question: Are standards of proof rules of
law? If not, what are they? Both English and American discussions, by judges and
commentators, abound with statements to the effect that it is impossible to give any
precise meaning to the civil and criminal standards of proof, that to attempt to do so

is otiose and may be dangerous and, as Sir Rupert Cross put it: “It is to be hoped
that such questions . . . will never be allowed to become the basis of prescribed rules”
(Cross (1979) 116). Yet, as we shall see, there is not only a very extensive theoretical
debate about the meaning and rationale of the various standards, but also, as Chief
Justice Burger acknowledged in Addington v. Texas, “even if the particular standard-
of-proof catch-words do not always make a great difference in a particular case,
adopting a ‘standard of proof’ is more than an empty semantic exercise” (441 U.S.
418, 423–25 (1979)).
Closely related to the above is the question: How many standards of proof are
there in ordinary litigation? Here there seems to be a divergence of views among
the authorities. In the United States it is now widely accepted that there are at least
three distinguishable standards: proof beyond reasonable doubt, proof on the pre-
ponderance of evidence, and an intermediate standard variously expressed as proof
by “clear and convincing,” “clear, cogent, and convincing,” or “clear, unequivocal,
and convincing” evidence.
In England, on the other hand, the predominant view is that there are only
two standards, but that there are different degrees of proof within each standard.
Denning, L.J., as he then was, stated the matter as follows:
The difference of opinion which has been evoked about the standard of proof in recent
cases may well turn out to be more a matter of words than anything else. It is of course
true that by our law a higher standard of proof is required in criminal cases than in civil
cases. But this is subject to the qualiﬁcation that there is no absolute standard in either
case. In criminal cases the charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, but there
may be degrees of proof within that standard. As Best, C.J., and many other great judges
have said, “in proportion as the crime is enormous, so ought the proof to be clear.”
So also in civil cases, the case may be proved by a preponderance of probability, but
there may be degrees of probability within that standard. The degree depends on the
subject-matter. A civil court, when considering a charge of fraud, will naturally require
for itself a higher degree of probability than that which it would require when asking
if negligence is established. It does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court, even
when it is considering a charge of a criminal nature; but still it does require a degree of
probability which is commensurate with the occasion.17
Is there any practical difference between the United States and English posi-
tions? It is commonly said that it would be unreasonable to expect the trier of fact
to demand the same level of proof for a minor trafﬁc violation as for a conviction
for murder and that in civil cases involving allegations of dishonesty or adultery
or illegitimacy, for example, a higher degree of probability is required than mere
preponderance of evidence. That some such deviations are and should be applied
is generally acknowledged, but there is a remarkable lack of clarity about the ratio-
nale(s) for such deviations and about the degree of deviation that is indicated in

each kind of case. Many judicial dicta suggest that the degree of probability may
depend on the seriousness of the consequences to the subject of the allegation (for
instance the stigma or likely harmful consequences of a judicial ﬁnding of adultery
or fraud or paternity). Are these views reconcilable?18
d. Appellate review: standards for limiting discretion
The limits of the fact-ﬁnder’s discretion here are of two types. First, the trial or the
appellate court may intervene if it is satisﬁed either that the evidence is insufﬁcient
to support a ﬁnding for a claimant or that the evidence eliminates all material
factual questions, either because it so overwhelmingly points to one conclusion
that reasonable persons could not differ as to the correct conclusion or because it
does not establish any genuine dispute with respect to a material issue of fact and
the question concerns only the identiﬁcation and application of the proper rule of
law.19 The prescribed standards for decisions of this type emphasize analysis, but
require evaluation as well. For example, sufﬁciency is typically couched in terms
of logical sufﬁciency, but it is clear that in most cases, the court is being asked to
evaluate the opposing evidence and to discount strength of the claimed inferences
to something approaching zero value. Second, if the evidence was logically sufﬁcient
and leaves questions of fact open for decision, the appellate court (or the trial judge
after a jury trial) may set aside the factual determination only if it can declare from
the evidence that the decision was clearly erroneous, against the manifest weight
of the evidence, or unsafe. However framed, the standards for legal intervention in
such circumstances are clearly designed to protect the fact-ﬁnder’s discretion and
to limit the occasions for intrusion.
Thestandardsofreviewmakeitclearthatthestandardsofproofare,fromthetrial
lawyer’s standpoint, merely guides to aid the fact-ﬁnder in exercising discretion. An
appellate court may not reverse a jury’s verdict unless it is satisﬁed that no rational
jury could have reached the verdict it did on the evidence before it under the
standard of proof applicable. Stated differently, so long as the evidence was logically
sufﬁcient to satisfy the standard and support the verdict, and not so overwhelmingly
one-sided as to eliminate all genuine issues of material fact, the jury’s discretion, in
theory, has no effective limits.20
Policies favoring ﬁnality and judicial efﬁciency have led the courts to mandate
similarlybroaddiscretionsfortrialjudgesasfact-ﬁnders.IntheUnitedStatesfederal
18 See the discussion in Roberts and Zuckerman (2004) 360–73.
19 Neither standard may be applied against the defendant in a criminal case, and it is generally agreed
that the jury has a discretion to acquit that cannot be effectively overruled. However, in England,
the Criminal Justice Act 2003, Part 10 authorizes the Court of Appeal to quash an acquittal for an
offence (which appears on a list of serious offences) if “new and compelling evidence” has later
come to light.
20 In England the standard for review in criminal appeals is now governed by section 2 of the Criminal
Appeal Act 1995, which states: “Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Court of Appeal (a) shall
allow an appeal against conviction if they think that the conviction is unsafe; and (b) shall dismiss
such an appeal in any other case.” On the debate leading up to this provision see Zander (2003)
658–75.

courts,forexample,acourtofappealsmaynotreverseadecisionevenwhenallthree
judges agree that they would have resolved the factual issues differently. Reversal
of a factual ﬁnding is permissible only when the reviewing court determines that
it is “clearly erroneous.”21 And a ﬁnding is only “‘clearly erroneous’ when . . . the
reviewing court on the entire record is left with the deﬁnite and ﬁrm conviction
that a mistake has been committed”(Icicle Seafoods Inc. v. Worthington, 475 U.S.
709 (1986)). Even then, the reviewing court may ordinarily not substitute its own
factual ﬁndings for those of the trial court.
The standards of review concerning admissibility decisions also leave broad dis-
cretion in the trial court. The standard of review for decisions involving balancing
tests is “abuse of discretion.” Even if the reviewing court is satisﬁed that the trial
judge exceeded the limits of the discretion allowed or otherwise erred in admitting
or excluding evidence, the counsel must still satisfy the court that the error affected a
substantial right of the appellant and had or may have had an effect on the outcome,
such that the error cannot be properly classiﬁed as harmless.
In one view, standards of review such as these are the only operative rules of law
regulating actual determinations. In that view, so long as the trial judge’s and jury’s
decisions fall within the broad range of discretion allowed by these rules of law,
these decisions are ﬁnal. That view, however, is subject to at least two further qual-
iﬁcations. First, most appellate judges are fully able to interpret rules and marshal
facts sufﬁciently to justify a reversal in any case in which they deem that appropriate.
This qualiﬁcation emphasizes the range of discretion and the power conferred upon
the appellate courts. Second, the view fails to acknowledge adequately the extent
to which judges and jurors take the standards seriously in attempting to exercise
discretion responsibly. Stated differently, deﬁning the range within which discretion
may be exercised under various standards does not deﬁne the range within which
discretion typically is exercised under those standards.
Theviewanditsqualiﬁcationsareimportantforthosewhowouldbetriallawyers.
The view emphasizes the range of discretion available and deﬁnes the framework
within which arguments may be constructed and made. It also emphasizes the
importance of analysis and argument in the trial court. The qualiﬁcations serve as
necessary cautions. The discretion at all levels is exercised by the men and women
who act as decision-makers. The advocate must frame her arguments in a manner
that takes account of the standpoint of the particular decision-makers to whom
they will be addressed and recognizes the psychological and other non-legal factors
that may be operative.

Probabilities, weight, and probative force
A. Introduction
There are no conclusions reached in legal disputes that can be stated with absolute
certainty.Consequently,theuseofprobabilisticconceptsisascommonininferences
in law as it is in inferences in other contexts. Probabilistic judgments concerning
various matters in law are usually made verbally. For example, forensic standards of
proof involve verbal probabilistic hedges such as “beyond reasonable doubt,” “clear
and convincing evidence,” and “probable cause.” In some contexts it is supposed
that probabilistic judgments will always be stated numerically either using numbers
on the conventional zero–one probability scale or in terms of odds. But in other
contexts, law for example, such numerical judgments are quite difﬁcult to make and
justify because the events of concern either happened or did not happen on exactly
one occasion. We cannot play the world over again a thousand times to determine
the frequency with which these events have happened in the past. On only rare
occasions in law can probabilities be determined by counting the frequency with
which some event has occurred in the past.
There are basically ﬁve reasons why, in any context including law, conclusions
based on evidence are necessarily probabilistic in nature. The ﬁrst is that our evi-
dence is always incomplete, we never have all of it. The second is that evidence is
commonly inconclusive. This means that the evidence may to some degree favor
more than one proposition at issue to some extent, or be consistent with the truth
of more than one proposition at issue. Evidence we have is often ambiguous; we can-
not decide what the evidence is telling us or what information it conveys. No better
examples of ambiguous evidence exist than are found in the letters Edith Thompson
wrote to Freddy Bywaters (see Chapter 7). Bodies of evidence are commonly disso-
nant; some of the evidence may favor one proposition while other evidence favors
another proposition. Finally, evidence comes to us from sources who/that have every
gradation of credibility shy of perfection. These ﬁve matters inﬂuence how the force
of evidence is assessed, and they also inﬂuence how forensic standards of proof are
stated.
There have been many attempts to relate verbal assessments of probabil-
ity to ranges of numerical probabilities. For example, what range of numerical

Probabilities, weight, and probative force
247
probabilities corresponds with someone’s saying “very likely”? One of the best
known efforts of this kind was undertaken by Sherman Kent who, for many years,
was termed the “Dean” of American intelligence analysts. Based on extensive empir-
ical studies involving many intelligence analysts, Kent generated intervals of proba-
bilitynumbersthatcorrespondedwithavarietyofverbalhedgesintelligenceanalysts
employ such as “very probable,” “probable,” “improbable,” and “very improbable.”
But efforts to equate verbal probabilistic hedges and intervals of numerical proba-
bilities are rarely taken seriously. The reason is that probability intervals advertised
as being equivalent to a verbal hedge may fail to be persuasive or useful to any given
person. In addition, such scales have been formed using just the conventional views
of probability. As we note in this section, there are other views of probability that
should be taken seriously.
Certain probabilistic judgments in law involve the use of metaphors, some of
which lead us to the essential topic in this section: the probative “weight,” “force”
or “strength” of evidence. As noted in Chapter 2, a major credential of evidence is
its probative weight, force or strength. We now consider the task of assessing this
important credential of evidence. Unfortunately, there is no settled way in which
this credential should be assessed and graded; there is considerable controversy
associated with these tasks. There appear to be only two uncontroversial character-
istics of the force, weight or strength of evidence. The ﬁrst is that gradations of the
probative force of evidence have vector-like properties; that is, evidence may point in
a certain direction (toward a certain proposition or probandum) with a certain force
orstrength.Thesecondisthatgradationsoftheforceorweightofevidencearealways
expressed probabilistically in some way. Here is where the major controversy lies
since there are quite different views about how evidential weight or force ought to
be assessed in probabilistic terms. So, considering the force or weight credential of
evidence is where probability enters our discussions. We now brieﬂy consider some
basic issues concerning probability and the force or weight of evidence. A more
extensive discussion of probability appears in the Appendix by Professor Philip
Dawid on the website.
B. Flirtations involving law and probability
Probability is an example of a discipline that, somewhat paradoxically, has a very
long past but a very short history. There is evidence that cave dwellers in Paleolithic
times used various devices (such as rudimentary dice) either for games of chance
or to foretell the future. Subsequent legal and religious works, such as the Talmud
and the Bible, make reference to probability and its determination in very sim-
ple situations. But it was not until the early 1600s that we have the ﬁrst records
of serious attempts to calculate probabilities. Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) is usually
credited with being the ﬁrst person to attempt to calculate probabilities associated
with games of chance. This marks the beginning of mathematics being used with
reference to probability. However, at this same time, persons in other ﬁelds began to

248
Analysis of Evidence
take an interest in whether probability calculations could be made regarding events
other than those involving games of chance. For example, merchants became inter-
ested in determining the probability that their cargoes would arrive safely at their
destinations. Historians became interested in determining the probability that past
events having historical signiﬁcance had actually occurred as recorded in ancient
documents. Theologians became interested in determining probabilities associated
with past events having religious signiﬁcance, particularly those involving miracles.
What is of interest to us, however, is that some legal scholars in the 1600s began to
take an interest in probabilities, particularly those associated with what they termed
the credibility-testimony problem.
One problem of interest to early jurists concerned how strongly our belief that a
certain event occurred ought to increase as we obtain testimony about this event’s
occurrence from additional witnesses. Testimony about the same event from two or
more witnesses was then said to be concurrent testimony; in Chapter 2 we used the
term corroborative1 with reference to such testimony. It was recognized at the time
that how strongly our belief increases with successive testimony depends upon the
credibility of each one of the witnesses. Another problem of interest concerned what
was then called successive testimony. Person A tells Person B that an event occurred;
B tells C, C tells D, and so on. The issue was: how certain can we be that the event,
as reported by the last person in this chain, actually occurred? You recognize this
last person’s testimony (what we presently have) as being secondhand or hearsay
evidence. Theologians were especially interested in successive testimony. Among
the matters of interest to them was the extent to which belief in some past religious
event might naturally decay over time as testimony about this event was passed
from one generation to the next, either orally or in written form. In the case of
successive testimony, the extent of the decay in belief depends upon the credibility
of each person or source in a chain of sources.
Thus began a long drawn out ﬂirtation between law and probability.2 This initial
ﬂirtation did not immediately ripen into a torrid romance. Some early scholars
were not at all convinced that the complexity of matters such as the credibility-
testimony problem could ever be captured in probabilistic terms. In addition, for
many years probabilists have linked probability only to those situations involving
replicable events for which we can obtain estimates of probabilities by counting or
enumeration. Unfortunately, this does not apply to most of the events that are of
interest to legal scholars and practitioners which tend to be unique, singular or
one-of-a-kind. As noted above, we cannot play the world over a thousand times to
determine the number of occasions a defendant actually committed the crime for
which he/she is now charged. Nor can we play the world over again to determine
the number of occasions on which a defendant may have committed repeated
instances of the same crime. Within evidence scholarship in law, during the past
1 On the ambiguity of the term “corroboration,” see the Glossary.
2 Good assessments of the historical beginnings of the ﬂirtation of law and probability are to be found
in the works of Lorraine Daston (1988) and Barbara Shapiro (1982, 1991).

Probabilities, weight, and probative force
249
30 years or so, there has been considerable debate about applications of probability
in the ﬁeld of law. This debate has been particularly intense because there are now
alternativeviewsaboutwhataprobabilitymeansintheﬁrstplace.Hereisaverybrief
review of some of the issues that are currently being addressed in this continuing
debate.
If there is now a romance between law and probability, it is often a stormy one.
One reason is that probabilists (and others) cannot agree about what constitutes
a “rational” approach to drawing conclusions from evidence having the ﬁve char-
acteristics noted above. Their disputes have only intensiﬁed debates among legal
scholars about the extent to which probability theories have anything of value to
offer scholars and practitioners in law. The so-called “probability debates” in law
have been underway now for over thirty years. What made contemporary legal
scholars begin to debate among themselves about probabilities? Identifying the
exact stimulus for any human activity is no easy task. Here is a brief summary of
works emerging during the law–probability ﬂirtation in recent times.
Developments were taking place in probability theory during the 1970s that
have forever changed the face of probability. Some very old ideas were challenged
within probability theory itself. Debates among probabilists about the merits of
these new ideas added considerable vigor to discussions about probability that took
place among legal scholars. The probabilistic reasoning tasks required in legal and
in many other contexts are far too rich for us to expect that all of this richness
can be captured within the conﬁnes of any single theory of probability. Papers by
Ekelof (1964), Williams (1979), Eggleston (1979), Twining (1980), and a book by
Cohen (1977) raised issues that gave rise to a conference on probabilistic issues
in law that took place in Durham, England in 1982 (Twining, 1983). In 1984 and
1988, Adrian Zuckerman, of the Oxford University Law Faculty, organized two
conferences on probability and evidence in the ﬁeld of law. Probabilists as well
as legal scholars attended both conferences. In 1986 and in 1990, Peter Tillers
(Cardozo Law School) held conferences on probability and evidence in law at
Boston University Law School and at Cardozo Law School. Papers given during
these two conferences were published in special issues of the Boston University Law
Review (Tillers and Green (1986), also (1988)) and in the Cardozo Law Review
(Tillers (1990)).
One focal point of much discussion about probabilities in law was the Collins
Case.3 The major issue in this case was one of identiﬁcation. According to witnesses,
a white female assaulted and attempted to rob an older woman. The female assailant
escaped from the scene in a car driven by an African-American male. Witnesses
described various details of the two participants and of the car in which they ﬂed the
scene. A white female and an African-American male, meeting these descriptions,
were subsequently arrested and brought to trial. The prosecution hired a probabilist
named Edward O. Thorp to calculate a statistical estimate of the probability that

Analysis of Evidence
any two persons would have the same characteristics as those described by the
witnesses (and possessed by the defendants). The probability estimate that Thorp
calculated was very small. On this basis, the prosecution argued that the two persons
in custody must have been the ones who committed the crime. To shorten a long
story, some probabilists immediately argued that Thorp’s calculations were quite
inappropriate and legal scholars argued about the justice of what was later called “a
trial by numbers.”
In 1970, in the wake of the Collins Case, appeared an article in the Harvard Law
Review by Finklestein and Fairley entitled: “A Bayesian Approach to Identiﬁcation
Evidence.” The authors attempted to provide what they believed would be a more
satisfactory approach to calculating identiﬁcation probabilities. Several probabilists
had also written papers that were justly critical of Thorp’s calculations in the Collins
Case. A year later, in 1971, came a resounding rebuttal to Finkelstein and Fairley
written by Professor Lawrence Tribe, also in the Harvard Law Review. Tribe’s piece
was entitled: “Trial by Mathematics: Precision and Ritual in the Legal Process.” Tribe
essentially argued against any use of numerical probabilities, as a matter of policy, in
settlingmattersattrial.Tribeadvancedthreemainreasonsforthis:(1)Asamatterof
communication, so long as judges and jurors can be assumed to be innumerate, they
should not be addressed in a language they cannot understand; (2) Mathematical
arguments are likely to be overly seductive or prejudicial because seemingly “hard”
quantiﬁed variables will tend to push out “soft” non-quantitative variables; and (3)
It is politically improper to quantify certain matters, such as an acceptable level of
risk of conviction of the innocent. In this debate about probabilities between jurists,
Tribe seems to have won the day.
But Tribe’s victory served only to stimulate other legal scholars to write about
probabilistic issues. If Tribe believed he had put probability to rest in the ﬁeld of
law, he was mistaken. An inﬂuential paper by Richard Lempert on relevance (1977)
considershowtheweightofevidenceshouldbegradedinprobabilisticterms.Inthis
work Lempert advised other legal scholars and practitioners not to ignore research
on probabilistic reasoning regardless of what Professor Tribe said about the evils
of mathematics. Lempert’s essential argument was that probabilistic analyses of
evidential issues could be very informative to jurists in a variety of ways. Lempert’s
work was very inﬂuential in arousing interest in probabilistic issues on the part of
other evidence scholars in law.
Each view of probability we will describe allows us to capture unique and impor-
tant elements of this intellectual richness. Each view has something valuable to say;
but no single view says it all. Within the ﬁeld of law, and in other ﬁelds as well,
debate about probability and the force of evidence continues.
C. Probability and the force or weight of evidence
In this section are four different probabilistic conceptions about ways of assessing
the probative force or weight of evidence.

Probabilities, weight, and probative force
251
1. Conventional probability and Bayes’s Rule
There are three basic axioms upon which this conventional view of probability rests:
r
Probabilities are either positive numbers or are zero (there are no negative
probabilities).
r
The probability of a sure event (one certain to happen) is 1.0.
r
If two events cannot happen jointly, the probability that one or the other occurs is
equal to the sum of their separate probabilities.
Taken together, these three properties simply say that probabilities are numbers
betweenzeroandone(inclusive)andthattheyareadditiveacrossmutuallyexclusive
events (those that cannot occur together or jointly). But all probabilities rest upon
what we know or assume at the time they are either calculated or judged; and they
may change in light of new information we obtain. Thus, all probabilities must have
somemeansbywhichtheycanberevisedorupdatedinlightof,orconditionalupon,
new information. In the conventional view of probability there exists the concept
of a conditional probability that shows one way of revising a probability in light of
new information. One very important consequence of these three axioms and how
a conditional probability is deﬁned is called Bayes’s Rule or Bayes’s Theorem (named
after the eighteenth-century English clergyman Thomas Bayes, who ﬁrst described
its properties).4
Suppose that we want to reassess the probability of a probandum in light of
a new item of evidence. This probability is called a posterior probability because
it concerns the probability of this proposition after we have obtained this new
evidence. In order to determine this posterior probability, we need to have two
ingredients. The ﬁrst, called a prior probability, expresses how sure we were that
this proposition is true before we received this new evidence. The second, called a
likelihood,allowsustoexpresshowstrongorforcefulisthisnewevidenceinchanging
our prior probability into a posterior probability. As we now illustrate, the force or
weight of evidence in conventional probabilities is graded by considering ratios of
likelihoods.
For example, suppose the probandum of interest is: It was Nicola Sacco who shot
the payroll guard Alessandro Berardelli. We must of course consider the alternative
proposition that it was not Nicola Sacco who shot Alessandro Berardelli. Here is
an item of evidence we must now take into consideration: The bullet that killed
Berardelli was ﬁred through a 32-caliber automatic pistol that Sacco was carrying
when he was arrested. Here is a picture of how the probative weight or force of this
evidence is graded in probabilistic terms using a ratio of likelihoods.
Shown in Figure 9.1 are two likelihoods. The ﬁrst expresses how likely it is
that the bullet that killed Berardelli was ﬁred through Sacco’s automatic, given
that Sacco did shoot Berardelli. The second expresses how likely it is that the bullet

that killed Berardelli was ﬁred through Sacco’s automatic, given that Sacco did not
shoot Berardelli. We ﬁrst notice that this bullet evidence is inconclusive. The bullet
mayhavebeenﬁredthroughSacco’sautomatic,butitmayhavebeenanotherperson
who ﬁred Sacco’s automatic. We are concerned of course about the credibility of
the bullet evidence. Perhaps this bullet was not ﬁred through Sacco’s automatic
(as the prosecution claimed).
The probative force of this bullet evidence depends on the relative sizes of the
two likelihoods shown in Figure 9.1. If we believe Likelihood 1 is greater than
Likelihood 2, then we are saying that this bullet evidence favors the proposition that
it was Sacco who shot Berardelli. How strongly the evidence favors Sacco shooting
Berardelli depends on how many times larger is Likelihood 1 than Likelihood 2;
this is why we consider their ratios. If we believe that Likelihood 2 is greater than
Likelihood 1, then we are saying that this bullet evidence favors the proposition that
SaccodidnotshootBerardelli.HowstronglythisevidencefavorsSacconotshooting
Berardelli depends on how many times larger is Likelihood 2 than Likelihood 1.
If the two likelihoods are equal, this says that the bullet evidence has no probative
force at all, since it is equally likely under both propositions at issue.
The example shown in Figure 9.1 concerns a likelihood ratio approach to grading
the probative force of just a single item of evidence. But this approach can also be
used to grade the probative force of bodies of evidence of various sizes. For example,
in the Sacco and Vanzetti case we might form a likelihood ratio for the entire mass
of evidence generated in this case. Here we would ask the question: Is this aggregate
evidence more likely if Sacco and Vanzetti were guilty as charged than it would be
if they were not guilty as charged?
Lempert (1977) argued that this way of expressing evidential force or weight is
entirely consistent with how FRE-401 deﬁnes relevance. Evidence is relevant if it
allows us to revise, upward or downward, our probability of some proposition. This
is exactly what a likelihood ratio expresses. It shows the extent to which an item or

253
body of evidence allows us to revise a prior belief (before new evidence) to form a
posterior belief (after taking the new evidence into account).
A likelihood ratio approach to grading the probative force of evidence has many
virtues. In a Wigmore chart, an argument linking evidence to some proposition
or probandum involves, among other things, revealing all the sources of doubt or
uncertainty we believe to lurk between the evidence and the proposition whose
proof is being sought. Each source of doubt represents a link in the chain of reason-
ing we have constructed to link evidence with what we are trying to prove from it.
Expanded forms of likelihood ratios allow us to combine all recognized sources of
doubt in assessing the probative force or weight of evidence. Some of these sources
of doubt concern the credibility of the source of the evidence. Other sources of
doubt concern links in chains of reasoning we construct to defend the relevance of
the evidence on the proposition at issue. So, likelihood ratios allow us to combine
both the credibility and relevance ingredients of the probative force of evidence.
Another major virtue of grading probative force or weight in terms of likelihood
ratios is that such methods allow us to capture for study and analysis a very wide
array of evidential and inferential subtleties that reside just below the surface of
even the simplest of evidence-based reasoning tasks. In Chapter 2 we provided
an account of the recurrent substance-blind forms and combinations of evidence.
Likelihood ratio analyses of the probative force of these forms and combinations of
evidence provide valuable insights about the consequences of having various beliefs
concerning the probabilistic ingredients required in assessing the probative force
of these forms and combinations of evidence (see further Schum, 1994, Chs. 6, 7,
and 8).
2. Evidential support and evidential weight: non-additive
probabilistic beliefs
The likelihood ratio approach just described rests on the three axioms mentioned
in introducing this approach. These three axioms were ﬁrst proposed by the Russian
mathematician A. N. Kolmogorov (1933). Axioms forming the basis for any formal
system are statements that the proponent believes are self-evident and that should
be accepted as such by everyone else. From a set of axioms various consequences
are deduced. Modern probability theory now provides a vast array of very use-
ful consequences that have been deduced from Kolmogorov’s three basic axioms,
including Bayes’s Rule. However, not everyone will necessarily accept as self-evident
what another person proposes as axioms. Shafer (1976) rejected Kolmogorov’s third
axiom involving additivity in relation to probability judgments that are necessary
for the unique events so commonly encountered in the ﬁeld of law. In Shafer’s sys-
tem there is a quite different interpretation of what the weight of evidence means.
Following is an example of his concerns about Kolmogorov’s additivity axiom and
what it says about probabilistic beliefs and the probative weight or force of evidence.
Suppose you have read the entire transcript of the Bywaters and Thompson
trial, as discussed in Chapter 7, and are asked to judge the probability, on all this

Analysis of Evidence
evidence, that Edith Thompson was guilty of the charge against her. She either
conspired with Freddy Bywaters to kill her husband Percy on the particular occasion
on which Percy was killed, or, over time, she incited Freddy to kill Percy on some
unspeciﬁed occasion. Suppose you judge this probability to be 0.6. Now, consider
the proposition that Edith is not guilty of this charge. Edith cannot be guilty and
not guilty at the same time; these two events are mutually exclusive. Further, they
are exhaustive; as far as legal deliberations are concerned, one of these events must
be true. So, if asked what the probability is that Edith was not guilty, Kolmogorov’s
rules state that you must say that this probability is 0.4, since the conventional
probabilities for mutually exclusive and exhaustive events must sum to 1.0. If you
had been a member of the jury in this case, you would almost certainly not have
voted to convict Edith, since your assessed probability of her guilt seems quite far
below a proof “beyond reasonable doubt.”
Reﬂecting on your task of assessing these probabilities, Professor Shafer argues
that this additivity requirement puts a burden on you that you might not be willing
to accept. The conventional system of probability requires that you must always
commit all of your probabilistic belief to mutually exclusive and exhaustive events;
you cannot hold back any of your belief or leave it uncommitted. Another way
of saying this is to say that you must be completely decisive in expressing your
beliefs; your probabilistic assessments must not reﬂect any indecision on your part.
However, suppose that you cannot decide what some of the evidence against Edith
reallymeans.TakeEdith’sletterstoFreddyforexample.Dotheymeanthatsheherself
had contemplated or even tried, without success, to kill Percy? Or, are they simply
manifestations of her fantasies about being rid of an abusive husband for whom she
nolongerhadanyaffection?Athirdpossibilityisthatthereisnoconnectionbetween
Edith’s letters to Freddy and the events surrounding Freddy’s killing of Percy. A
major feature of Shafer’s approach to probabilistic reasoning is that it provides for
instances in which you can deliberately withhold some of your probabilistic belief.
In other words, you are entitled to be indecisive in situations in which, among other
factors, you cannot decide what some of the evidence really means.
To illustrate further some of the consequences of being able to withhold some
of your probabilistic beliefs, we ﬁrst need to examine Shafer’s views about what
the probative weight or force of evidence really means. His interpretation of this
credential of evidence is quite different from the likelihood ratio interpretation we
examined above. On Shafer’s view, the weight of evidence means the support this
evidence provides to propositions at issue. The more support evidence provides to
some proposition the greater the weight of this evidence. Shafer employs numbers
between zero and 1.0 (inclusive) to indicate the degree of support or weight, but he
does so in a way that is not consistent with the Kolmogorov axiom for additivity.
Suppose we let U = the ultimate probandum that Edith Thompson is guilty of the
charge against her; then not – U = the negation of U or the possibility that Edith
is not guilty of the charge against her. Following is an example of what you are
permitted to do using Shafer’s system.

Consider just the letters that Edith wrote to Freddy; let L be the evidence of these
letters. To what extent do these letters, as evidence, support U or not – U? Let SL be
the support you will assign to these possibilities based on letter evidence L: Here is
an example of how you can assign SL.
{U}
{not – U}
{U, not – U}
SL :
0.6
0.1
0.3
These support assignments say that you believe Edith’s letters support her guilt to
degree 0.6 and her being not guilty to degree 0.1. But, what does the support of 0.3
you have assigned to {U, not – U} mean? First, read the expression {U, not – U} as:
Edith is guilty or Edith is not guilty. The value of SL = 0.3 you have assigned to {U,
not – U} indicates the degree of indecision on your part about whether her letters
support Edith’s guilt or support Edith’s being not guilty. In other words, this is the
degree of your evidential support, indicated by SL, that you have held back or have
not yet committed to either U or to not – U speciﬁcally. You can regard SL = 0.3 for
{U, not – U} as indicating the degree of your support that could favor either U or
not – U but which one you cannot presently decide.
Observe in the example above that your present beliefs about U and not – U,
based on letter evidence L, do not sum to 1.0, as would be required in conventional
probability. If you had been using Bayes’ Rule, your posterior probabilities for U
and not – U, based on letter evidence L, would be required to sum to 1.0. You can
in fact assign support S to propositions or probanda in ways that capture a wide
assortment of belief states that we all experience. This is one of the major virtues of
Shafer’s system. Here is an example of an extreme belief that you can capture using
Shafer’s system; it involves the concept of ignorance as lack of belief. Using Edith’s
letters to Freddy again, suppose that after reading these letters you believe that they
are sufﬁciently ambiguous that you simply cannot decide whether they speciﬁcally
favor U or not – U to any degree at all. In other words you cannot commit any of
yourbeliefspeciﬁcallytoeitherofthesepossibilities.Inthiscase,yourSL assignment
would look like this:
{U}
{not – U}
{U, not – U}
SL :
0
0
1.0
What this support assignment says is that you are presently completely indecisive
about the extent to which the letter evidence supports either U or not–Uspeciﬁcally
and so you have completely withheld all of your support from either one of these
possibilities. You presently have no grounds for saying that this letter evidence
speciﬁcally supports U or supports not – U.
It is entirely fair to ask what the consequence is, in the above example, of having
assigned SL = 0 to both U and to not – U speciﬁcally. The answer to this question
requires us to compare Shafer’s support scale with the scale in the conventional
probability system. First, here is a listing of interpretations that can be placed on
the end points of the conventional probability scale:

Analysis of Evidence
Figure 9.2 Conventional probability scale
Figure 9.3 Evidential support scale
On this conventional probability scale the value 1.0 means that an event is certain
to occur or you have a complete belief that this event will occur. The probability
value zero means that an event is certain not to occur or that you disbelieve that
this event occurred. We discuss the proof-disproof dimension on this probability
scale momentarily when we consider the third view of what is meant by the weight
or force of evidence. But on an evidential support scale for S there is an entirely
different meaning attached to the zero point; this scale is shown in Figure 9.3.
The major distinction between conventional probabilities and Shafer’s support
assignments is that zero no longer represents disbelief but lack of belief. In the con-
ventional system of probability, a probability of zero assigned to some proposition
means that this proposition is completely dead; it cannot be resuscitated by any fur-
ther evidence, regardless of how strong this evidence might seem. In other words,
we cannot say that we disbelieve some proposition and then later say we believe it.
But we can say that a lack of belief means something entirely different than disbelief.
We can go from a lack of belief to some degree of belief if our evidence supports
this change. So, propositions assigned S = 0 are not forever dead as they would be
if they were assigned conventional probabilities.
Finally, since an axiom of conventional probability is violated in Shafer’s system,
we should not expect to see Bayes’s Rule being the means for revising our beliefs
about propositions in light of further evidence. In Shafer’s system there is a rule

called Dempster’s Rule that allows us to combine support assignments assigned to
different items or bodies of evidence. Dempster’s Rule allows us to go from a lack
of belief to some degree of belief in a proposition in light of further evidence (see
further Shafer (1976), Schum (1994) 225–43).
3. Baconian probability and completeness of evidential coverage
Centuries ago, Sir Francis Bacon proposed the idea that we would be wasting our
time trying to prove some general hypothesis or proposition just by accumulating
evidential instances favorable to this hypothesis. Regardless of how many results
favorable to this hypothesis we have accumulated, all it takes is one demonstrably
unfavorableresulttodisprovethishypothesis.WhatBaconarguedwasthatwewould
be far better off performing evidential tests designed to eliminate any hypothesis
we are considering. The hypothesis that best resists our most concerted efforts to
eliminate it, as well as any other hypotheses, is the one in which we should have
increasing conﬁdence. This strategy has become known as induction by elimination.
The best known development of Bacon’s method was by John Stuart Mill (1843).
It will not do of course in eliminative testing to perform the same test over and
over again. This may increase our belief about the reliability of this single test, but
it will not increase our belief regarding the extent to which any hypothesis holds up
in many circumstances. In the testing of drugs for their possible toxicity to human
beings we need to determine whether a drug continues to be non-toxic under such
conditions as various levels and spacing of dosages, the age and sex of the recipients
of the drug, and possible interactions with other drugs a person might be taking.
In short, eliminative testing also needs to be variative in nature. The more different
conditions under which a hypothesis holds up, the more conﬁdence we can have
in it.
John Stuart Mill was not successful in showing how conventional probability is
applicable in eliminative and variative testing. Nor was the philosopher Karl Popper
later on, who also advocated eliminative testing, successful in relating conventional
probability to such testing. Popper did, however, claim that science should strive
for improbable hypotheses that provide us with the most surprising deductions of
new phenomena (Popper, 1968). Development of a system of probability expressly
congenial to eliminative and variative induction awaited the work of L. Jonathan
Cohen. In Cohen’s major work (1977), he advocated a system of probabilities that
we now call Baconian to acknowledge their linkage to Bacon’s original ideas about
eliminative and variative testing. In Cohen’s Baconian probability system, evidence
is relevant only if it serves to eliminate one or more hypotheses or propositions
being considered. Such elimination, however, is usually only tentative since later
evidence may act to explain away the eliminative properties of an earlier item of
evidence on a certain hypothesis.
Cohen’sBaconianprobabilitiesdifferconsiderablyfromordinaryprobabilitiesas
illustrated on the scale in Figure 9.2. First, as in Shafer’s support S scale, a Baconian
probability of zero has a different meaning as shown in Figure 9.4. On this Baconian

Analysis of Evidence
Figure 9.4 A Baconian probability scale
scale zero means lack of proof rather than disproof. A Baconian probability of zero
for some hypothesis can be revised upward since we can go from lack of proof to
some proof if justiﬁed by evidence. Notice that we have not put any number to be
associated with the upper end of the Baconian scale. The reason involves several
additional properties of Baconian probabilities.
Cohen’s Baconian probabilities have only ordinal properties. What this means
is that we can compare them to see which is larger but we cannot perform any
algebraicoperationsonthem(thoseinvolvingaddition,subtraction,multiplication,
or division). A Baconian probability for some hypothesis or proposition increases
as this hypothesis passes more eliminative and variative evidential tests. But the tests
may not all be comparable since they involve different matters. Thus, for example,
we cannot say that the Baconian probability of hypothesis H1, which has passed four
tests, is twice as large as the Baconian probability of hypothesis H2, which has only
passed two tests. The reason is that the tests passed by these hypotheses may not be
comparable in terms of their importance or eliminative potential. In short, there is
no natural unit of Baconian probability as assumed in conventional probabilities
or on Shafer’s support scale.
We now come to the most important property of Baconian probability as far as
concerns the probative weight or force of evidence. In the eliminative and variative
testing of hypotheses, it is altogether important to consider how many different
tests have been performed and how completely our testing has involved all relevant
matters that anyone could think of. In testing the toxicity of a drug, for example,
regardless of how many other tests drug X has passed, we will not have conﬁdence
in its being non-toxic if we have failed to check to see whether it remains non-
toxic when taken with other drugs or if we ignore its possible long-run effects. In
a Baconian view of probabilistic reasoning the weight of evidence depends in large
part on how many questions there are that remain unanswered by the evidence we
have. In short, the Baconian weight of evidence is related to how complete has been
the coverage of evidence on matters recognized to be relevant in the inference at
hand. Here is a picture of the Baconian interpretation of the probative weight or
force of evidence; it involves the “inferential limb” on which we ﬁnd ourselves when
we attempt to draw a conclusion from evidence.
Suppose on the basis of a collection of evidence we decide to conclude that
hypothesis H is true. Figure 9.5 illustrates the inferential limb we ﬁnd ourselves on
when we draw this conclusion. The length and strength of this limb depends upon

Figure 9.5 Illustrating the Baconian weight of evidence
two things. First, the strong part of our inferential limb depends on how much
credible evidence we have that is favorable to hypothesis H. Second, the weak part
of our inferential limb depends on how many questions regarding the likeliness
of any of our hypotheses remain unanswered by the evidence we have. Baconian
probabilities take both of these matters into account. Answers to some of these
unanswered questions may in fact be favorable to our chosen hypothesis H; but
other answers may not be at all favorable to H. We cannot know which ones and
how many will also be favorable until we ask the questions. The basic reason why
we do not put a speciﬁc number on the right-hand end of the Baconian probability
scale in Figure 9.4 is that we ordinarily do not know how many tests of hypoth-
esis H are possible. We can only list those unanswered questions that we have
recognized.
Cohen’s system of Baconian probability is the only system that takes speciﬁc
account of how completely the evidence we have covers matters recognized to be
relevant in the testing of hypotheses we entertain. Such information is not con-
veyed, for example, by Bayesian posterior probabilities, even if they are very large
and near 1.0. Cohen argues that in judging the probative force of evidence we can-
not ignore how much evidence we have and how completely it covers questions
relevant to matters at issue. It happens that Cohen’s major work (1977) is espe-
cially directed at inferences in the ﬁeld of law. In this work, he has assembled a
large collection of anomalies and paradoxes he says are associated with attempts to
apply conventional probabilities to inferences in law. A discussion of the anomalies
and paradoxes Cohen identiﬁed appears elsewhere (Schum, 1979). His work gen-
erated widespread discussion and much controversy among legal scholars as well
as probabilists. Not all of the troubles he mentioned were viewed as anomalous or
paradoxical. But we should not ignore what he has told us about the importance of
evidential completeness in grading the probative weight of evidence.

4. Wigmore and the fuzzy weight of evidence
Wigmore was no probabilist, but he did understand that the linkages between
probanda in chains of reasoning are probabilistic in nature. This is why we have
said that a chain of reasoning involves sources of doubt or uncertainty. He described
the strength of these probabilistic linkages in words rather than numbers. This is
something that we all do on many occasions when we wish to convey to others our
beliefs about the likeliness of events when we have no basis for assigning precise
numerical probabilities to these events. But Wigmore also used the term “force” in
describing the strength of these probabilistic linkages. He used different symbols
attached to his arrows linking probanda. One symbol meant “weak probative force”;
another symbol meant “strong probative force”; another meant “provisional pro-
bative force”; and there were others. One criticism frequently directed at Wigmore’s
methods concerns his never providing any method for combining all of these verbal
probabilistic force gradations in reaching a conclusion about the aggregate force of
some mass of evidence.
Wigmore died in 1943, only 22 years before the development of “fuzzy logic”
by Professor LotﬁZadeh. In a celebrated paper in 1965, Zadeh asked us all to rec-
ognize how much imprecision is rampant in our inferences, decisions and other
activities. In probabilistic reasoning, for example, we so often attach words rather
than numbers to indicate the strength of our conclusions, since we have no basis
for providing precise single probabilities or even intervals of probabilities. Such
probabilities Zadeh has called “fuzzy probabilities” recognizing their imprecision.
Wigmore’s methods for grading probative force are examples of fuzzy probabili-
ties or hedges. What is especially interesting about Zadeh’s work is that he pro-
vides methods for combining fuzzy gradations of various things. Following is just
one example of Zadeh’s concerns about the fuzziness rampant in our everyday
reasoning.
Suppose you hear the following argument: “If a person is overworked and under-
paid, then this person is probably not very satisﬁed with his/her job.” We hear argu-
ments like this all the time; Zadeh calls such reasoning “inexact” or “approximate.”
All the words italicized in the sentence above are fuzzy ingredients; there is no pre-
cision here regarding any of these ingredients. Fuzzy probabilistic qualiﬁers abound
in the ﬁeld of law, for example: beyond reasonable doubt, balance of probabilities,
clear and convincing evidence, and probable cause. All these forensic standards of
decision are necessarily fuzzy since we are unable to provide precise and uncon-
troversial numerical probabilities, of any kind, to associate with them. In many
situations we may not be able to improve upon Wigmore’s fuzzy gradations of the
probative force of evidence. All of the views we have examined have been criticized
in various ways. Zadeh’s work on fuzzy logic has not escaped criticism. Susan Haack
(1996) questions the philosophical bona ﬁdes of fuzzy logic and also points out that
applications of fuzzy logic designed to cope with imprecision involve mechanisms
that do induce precision.

Probabilities, weight, and probative force
261
In summary, we have provided four quite different interpretations of what is
meant by the probative force, weight or strength of evidence. Each view tells us
something valuable about this important credential of evidence, but no single view
says all there is to be said. Likelihood ratios from Bayes’s Rule allow us to capture
many interesting and important evidential and inferential subtleties and are con-
sistent with what FRE-401 says regarding relevance. Shafer’s direct assessments of
evidential weight as evidential support allow us to be indecisive in hedging conclu-
sionsandtowithholdportionsofourbeliefs,andtheyallowustocaptureimportant
judgmental characteristics that are very common. Baconian interpretations of the
probative force of evidence alert us to the importance of considering how much
evidence we have and how completely it covers matters we recognize as relevant
in inferences we make. Questions we have not yet answered are just as important
in inferences as those for which we have obtained evidential answers. Finally, Wig-
more’s fuzzy gradations of the force of evidence are certainly in keeping with the
many other fuzzy interpretations of uncertainties encountered in the ﬁeld of law.

Necessary but dangerous: generalizations
and stories in argumentation about facts1
Since, then, our inferences from fact to fact depend upon our belief in general rules
of connection between fact and fact, generalizations about the way things happen in
nature, the work of criticizing inferences resolves itself into that of criticizing general-
izations. (Sidgwick (1884) 9)
We have seen that generalizations are almost always necessary as warrants for
every step in inferential reasoning, but that they can often be shown to be the
weakest points in an argument (Chapter 3). Similarly, we have seen that stories are
not just an alternative to analytical approaches such as the chart method, but rather
complement them in important ways (Chapter 6). According to some psychologists
and practitioners stories are psychologically necessary to decision-making about
issues of fact. Yet another strand in the literature suggests that stories are wonderful
vehicles for “cheating” in the process of persuasion in legal contexts. In this chapter
we look in more detail at the nature of generalizations and stories, their role in
fact-determination, some reasons why they can be labeled dangerous, some links
between these dangers, and practical techniques for navigating them in litigation.
A. Generalizations
1. Reprise and introduction
Generalizations are warrants that serve as the “glue” that links an item of evidence
to a particular interim or ultimate probandum by showing that it is relevant (Foun-
dations 81–83, 109). We have previously examined the role of generalizations in
arguments about evidence. In Chapter 3 we identiﬁed the role that generalizations
perform in the application of the principles of logic in constructing and analyzing
arguments. The materials from R. v. Bywaters and Thompson illustrated the kinds
of covert roles that generalizations based upon prejudice may play, roles that make
them dangerous. Chapters 8 and 9 presented current views on how evidence may
be evaluated in various contexts. All of those views depend upon the evaluator’s
1 This chapter is based in large part on two articles (Twining, 1999, and Anderson, 1999). Some of
the themes are further developed in Bazaar, Chs. 12–16.

assessment of the strength (the degree of certainty) with which the generalizations
upon which the arguments being evaluated depend can be expressed.
In this chapter we integrate these materials and present a more comprehensive
analysis of the roles generalizations play. In the next section, we focus on how the
degree of certainty affects the use of generalizations in determining how evidence
should be evaluated. In Section 3, we examine the ways in which generalizations can
be classiﬁed and the differences that stem from those classiﬁcations. The legitimacy
of the common law adversary system of dispute resolution depends in some part
on an assumption that there is a cognitive consensus, an assumption that members
of society share a core of basic information and view the world in similar ways. We
describe and assess this view in Section 4. Section 5 identiﬁes the dangers that stem
fromtheuseofgeneralizations.Weconcludewithanexaminationofgeneralizations
from the practitioner’s standpoint.
2. Degrees of certainty
Perhaps all and certainly most inferences from particular to particular depend
upon an unstated generalization.2 When the usually covert generalization is made
explicit, the inductive reasoning upon which the proposed inference depends can
be translated into a quasi-deductive form, and that forces into prominence the
generalization being assumed as a major premise. However, generalizations are
usually hedged in some way:
In reasoning from E∗to E at the ﬁrst step, I might assert the following: If we have
evidence that an event occurred, this event usually (often, sometimes, frequently, etc.)
did occur. Thus I believe we have some degree of license to reason from evidence E∗to E,
the event(s) reported in the evidence. But notice that I have hedged this generalization
or warrant; I did not say: When we have this evidence that an event occurred, this event
necessarily occurred. If it is inconclusive, evidence about some event does not allow me
to say that the occurrence of the event is certain. Which hedge I choose depends upon
the strength of my own belief based upon experiences I have had in evaluating this kind
of evidence. At this stage I might say: If something like E happens then something like
F usually (often, sometimes, frequently, etc.) happens . . . (Schum, Foundations, 81–2)
If one were able to quantify the frequency of an event with reasonable conﬁdence,
one could formally convert a generalization that is hedged into the major premise
of a syllogism:
In all cases of X there is a 0.7 probability (70% likelihood) of Y
This is a case of X
Therefore Y is 0.7 probable.
2 Anderson and Schum are in the “all” camp (see pp. 100–101 above); Twining draws the line at
“certainly most.”

Analysis of Evidence
However, such estimates need to be treated with great caution: What is the basis for
the estimate? Who is making the estimate? Might it be biased, purely speculative or
otherwise unreliable? Is it an example of false precision? And so on.
However, an inference openly based on a fuzzy generalization is conspicuously
weak:
X and Y sometimes occur simultaneously
This is a case of X
Therefore Y may have occurred simultaneously.
It is important to distinguish between the strength of support for a generalization
and its probative force if it is accepted as true. Here we ﬁnd an interesting feature
of the operation of generalizations in the kind of argument with which we are
concerned: the more cautious a generalization, the more plausible it is likely to be,
but the weaker the support that it gives to the probandum.3 For example, using the
example of the disparity of age between Edith and Freddie, the generalization, “All
older women dominate all younger men in all circumstances,” would give strong
support to the probandum, “Edith dominated Freddie in all circumstances,” if it
were true. But it clearly is not true. On the other hand, a proposition such as: “In
intimate relationships the older partner tends to be the dominant partner” is more
plausible, but it is very vague and at best gives weak support to the probandum that
Edith incited Freddie to murder her husband.
Moreover, there are many other possible generalizations that might be imagined,
some pointing in the opposite direction. Consider again the differences in age
between Edith and Freddie. We could move by a number of different routes from
this fact to the intermediate probandum that Edith inﬂuenced Freddie. There are
several possible generalizations about the relations between an older woman and
a younger man. A lawyer might argue that in such relationships, for example:
(a) older women tend to dominate, (b) older women are insecure, (c) older women
are demanding, (d) older women are more inclined to take initiatives, (e) older
women play the role of a mother substitute, and so on. Each of these could provide
a signiﬁcantly different route to support or negate an argument concerning the
existence, extent, and effect of Edith’s inﬂuence over Freddie. Furthermore, each of
these generalizations could also lead to other intermediate probanda about motive
or intent or something else.
It appears from the argument that counsel for the prosecution in Bywaters and
Thompson selected (a). Why? Perhaps, because it provides stronger support for the
intermediate probandum “Edith dominated Freddie or Edith inﬂuenced Freddie.”
But upon reﬂection, perhaps backed by research, we might conclude that there is
stronger support for one of the other generalizations (b) through (e). To repeat: it
3 It is not quite correct to say that the probative force of a generalization varies inversely with
the strength of support for it, because some universal or near-universal generalizations are well
founded.

is important to distinguish between the strength of support for the generalization
and the probative force of the generalization, if it is accepted as true.
Therearefurthercomplexities.EdithandFreddiecanbecharacterizedingender-
neutral terms: as partners, lovers, persons, for example. The context can be char-
acterized in a way that hedges the generalization: in intimate relationships, in love
affairs, or more vaguely in relationships of this kind. Each of the elements could
be expressed in heavily loaded emotive terms. To give a crude example: An ageing
adulteress will manipulate a naive adolescent.
The important point here is that, for the lawyer, the choice of formulation is
crucial. The precise, speciﬁc formulation may set up an irrefutable syllogism com-
pelling the conclusion sought, if the decision-maker accepts the generalization in
that form as true. But in most cases, the generalization will not be that well estab-
lished nor that widely shared nor very precise. Probably no one believes that “All
older women dominate all younger men all of the time,” and some potential jurors
would probably reject such a generalization even in a much weaker form.
3. Types of generalizations
Generalizations can be categorized in different ways for different purposes. In
Chapter 3, we identiﬁed three axes that could be used in classifying generaliza-
tions – a generality (or level of abstraction) axis, a reliability (or degree of certainty)
axis, and a source (or basis) axis. There is a fourth axis that should also be viewed
as a part of that classiﬁcation scheme – what might be called a commonality axis.
The commonality axis refers to how widely the generalization would be accepted
or shared within the particular community in which a disputed question had to be
resolved.
At one end of the commonality spectrum are generalizations that are shared only
by a small number of people. Examples might be drawn for generalizations falling
along any of the other three axes – e.g., generalizations expressing the prejudice that
underlay the hatred that separated the Capulets and the Montagues; generaliza-
tions acquired by experience or study necessary to fully understand and accurately
evaluate the performances of world-class athletes; or the generalizations under-
stood only by astrophysicists trying to evaluate data being generated by the Hubble
telescope.
At the other end of the spectrum are generalizations that are universally or
widely shared within the relevant community. Examples clustering at this end of
the spectrum are similarly diverse – e.g., generalizations based upon prejudices of
thekindthathaveresultedin“ethniccleansing”inRwandaortheformerYugoslavia;
generalizations originally based upon scientiﬁc or mathematical principles that are
now shared generally in most communities – e.g., any object dropped will fall until
it reaches the ground or some other surface; generalizations derived from common
experience – e.g., all lighted stove burners are very hot.

Analysis of Evidence
byplacingthemalongtheaxesidentiﬁedabove.Asaresult,thecategoriescommonly
used to describe generalizations are overlapping, imprecise, and ambiguous, and
the descriptions employed often conceal, rather than disclose, differences that are
important. Nonetheless, lawyers and others who must work with generalizations
in constructing and critiquing arguments about disputed questions of fact must be
aware of the descriptions commonly used and of the roles that generalizations so
described have played and will play in such arguments and critiques.
Generalizations can be categorized in different ways for different purposes. In
the context of arguments about questions of fact, it is useful to categorize them
in terms of source and reliability. From the standpoint of a lawyer, it is useful to
distinguish between two main types: (a) case-speciﬁc generalizations contrasted
with (b) background generalizations, which in turn can be classiﬁed roughly in
terms of their reliability – scientiﬁc/expert, general knowledge, experience-based,
and synthetic-intuitive (or belief) generalizations. In the context of argumentation
in legal processes different considerations apply to each category. Generalizations
can be placed on a spectrum of reliability ranging from well-tested and generally
accepted propositions, such as those associated with the law of gravity, to largely
untested and sometimes untestable intuitions, such as the generalizations upon
which the view that running from the scene of a crime is evidence of guilt, to
unfounded biases based upon false stereotypes – such as prejudices based on gender,
race, class, or age.4
a. Case-speciﬁc generalizations
These may be used explicitly or implicitly in argument in a particular case. They
may include descriptions about personal habits or character, or local practices (how
newlybornbabiesarelabeledinthishospital),orallegationsofageneralnature,such
as “The employer-defendant in this case regularly discriminated against women in
its employment practices.”
Case-speciﬁc background knowledge may be a mixture of particular and general
information, such as Welt’s use of “local knowledge” in relation to bus time tables
and the Old Sumter Inn in “The Nine Mile Walk” (above, page 11). A composite
picture of Edith’s character as a successful businesswoman and a forceful person
might be used to bolster a generalization to the effect that she was the dominant
partner in her relationship with her lover.
Such generalizations may become operative in a speciﬁc case, although fre-
quently they remain in the background. They may be supported by explicit evidence
adduced, for example, in an employment discrimination case. But often they may

Court that women could not be admitted to the bar): “The paramount destiny and mission of
women are to fulﬁl the noble and benign ofﬁces of wife and mother. That is the law of the Creator.
And the rules of civil society must be adapted to the general constitution of things, and cannot be
based on exceptional cases” (Bradley, J., concurring at 141–42).

may have been true about sexual prejudices among jurors at the trial of Bywaters
and Thompson.5 They may be and frequently are a product of both.
Especially if they are supported by evidence, case-speciﬁc generalizations tend
to push out or trump background generalizations. For example, in Bywaters and
Thompson it was important for the prosecution to prove that Freddie’s attack on
Percywaspremeditated,forthatwouldsupportthepropositionthatheactedinpur-
suance of a conspiracy or because of Edith’s incitement. The main evidence in sup-
port of this was the highly ambiguous tea-room letter (Exhibit 60) and the fact that
he was carrying a knife. The probative value of this last fact would be considerably
weaker if it could be shown that Freddie was in the habit of carrying the knife wher-
ever he went. Freddie claimed this, but his credibility was weak. If Edith’s counsel
had called one of Freddie’s shipmates as a witness to support this case-speciﬁc gen-
eralization, that would have weakened the prosecution’s case very signiﬁcantly. In
the event, both sides had to rely on contradictory or divergent background gen-
eralizations. The prosecution argued that “Possession of a knife of this kind was
in itself suspicious,” and that “No reasonable man living in London carries a knife
like this in his pocket.” The defense argued: “It is not strange for a seafaring man
visiting foreign countries, to purchase a knife,” and “There are few sailors who do
not possess a knife.” (See Figure 10.1.) A witness-backed case-speciﬁc generalization
about Freddy’s habits in this respect would have been much more persuasive than
any of these background generalizations.6
The evidence necessary to establish many case-speciﬁc generalizations will ordi-
narily be admitted automatically. Edith was 28, Freddie was 20, and both sat before
the jury. It is difﬁcult to see how counsel for the defense could have prevented the
jury from learning that “Edith is older than Freddie.” In such a circumstance, coun-
sel must determine what generalizations this fact may evoke in the jurors’ minds
(e.g., “older women dominate younger men”) and how to enhance or diminish their
effect. Often important case-speciﬁc generalizations may have to be established by
evidence.
It is also possible that evidence might be adduced to enhance or diminish the
strength of generalizations that might otherwise be held or accepted by the triers
of fact. For example, psychologists might today be employed to examine Edith and
Freddie and, on that basis, might be able to express an opinion about whether
Edith did or could inﬂuence Freddie’s conduct in important matters. Similarly,
social science survey techniques might conceivably today enable lawyers to produce
evidence as to what proportion of seafaring men habitually carried knives in their
coat pockets. The attempt to prove such case-speciﬁc generalizations raises an array
5 “Mrs Thompson was hanged for immorality” is a remark attributed to her counsel by several
commentators.

eralizations that have been made more concrete in the context of a particular case. This is different

of problems concerning availability, admissibility, and utility that are frequently
treated in standard texts on evidence and trial practice. However, it is quite unre-
alistic to expect to use experts for the great majority of propositions used in argu-
ments about judicial evidence, even when there is potentially applicable scientiﬁc
material.
b. Background generalizations
Karl Llewellyn wrote:
[W]hen Michael and Adler divided knowledge into two essential categories: “common
sense” and “scientiﬁc knowledge,” they overlooked . . . that the matter does not thus
cleave neatly into two signiﬁcant areas, but that it stretches out or sprawls instead
between two poles. At the one pole is ignorance and pure guess. At the other pole
is solid and thoroughly systematized scientiﬁc knowledge. “Common sense” is, so to
speak, in the South Temperate Zone. Uncommon sense, ordered, pondered on with
care, and tested out once and again in inconclusive but still illuminating corrective
careful tests – that is so to speak, in the North Temperate Zone. Knowledge does not
have to be scientiﬁc, in order to be on the way toward Science. Neither does it have to
be scientiﬁc in order to be extremely useful. (Llewellyn (1936) 22)
In the absence of experts or other direct evidence, we fall back on background
generalizations. In the Rationalist Tradition it is assumed that the triers of fact,
including jurors, come already equipped with a largely shared “stock of knowl-
edge,” which is the main source of warrants for making inferences in arguments
about questions of fact. This equipment is commonly described as “general experi-
ence,”“backgroundknowledge,”“commonsense,”or“society’sstockofknowledge.”
Again we need to ask, whose experience, sense, or knowledge? As we shall see, each
of these expressions is somewhat misleading if it is used to refer to the totality
of the individual and communal beliefs that are used as warrants for inferential
reasoning.
What is advanced as knowledge, common sense, or shared beliefs is too var-
ied to be susceptible to precise classiﬁcation. The bases for such generalizations
are as varied as the sources for the beliefs themselves – education, direct experi-
ence, the media, gossip, ﬁction, fantasy, speculation, prejudice, and so on. In legal
contexts it is useful to draw broad distinctions between different kinds of general-
izations according to their perceived reliability in a given society at a given time,
bearing in mind that there is a continuum that ranges from uncontested scientiﬁc
truths, through “knowledge” based on more or less established forms of expertise,
to largely uncontested general knowledge, to less established “common sense” gen-
eralizations, to beliefs that are based on limited experience, faith, speculation, myth,
or prejudice. Although these are quite rough categories, it is important to realize
that they can operate quite differently in arguments about questions of fact in legal
contexts.

Analysis of Evidence
c. Scientiﬁc knowledge and expertise
Scientiﬁc generalizations are based upon scientiﬁc knowledge and research. They
vary in terms of their reliability. There are those based upon the “laws of science”
(e.g., the applications of the law of gravity to prove how long it took the victim’s
body to strike the sidewalk after he was pushed out of the sixteenth-story window).
There are those based upon well-established principles (e.g., the body of scientiﬁc
knowledge upon which ﬁngerprint identiﬁcation is based). There are those extrap-
olated from research ﬁndings that are less well-established or are recognized as less
reliable (e.g., voice print identiﬁcation or the nature of the relationship between
prenatal smoking and birth defects). Typically, these are generalizations that are
established by expert witnesses who testify both as to one or more case-speciﬁc
generalization, that are relevant (e.g., to establish that the deceased died at 4:30
p.m.) and, if required, to the scientiﬁc generalizations that support that conclusion.
The courts have come to rely increasingly on scientiﬁc and other expert evi-
dence. This in turn has generated problems about the qualiﬁcations of experts,
the probative helpfulness of expert evidence, how to deal with novel and contested
“scientiﬁc” ﬁndings, the role of experts in testifying directly to ultimate and penul-
timate probanda (“the ultimate issue” problem), and the tensions between the
fallibilism of science and the need for ﬁnality in adjudication.7 It was estimated
that by 1990 over 70 percent of civil jury trials in the United States involved expert
evidence and the proportion has been growing. DNA and other advances in foren-
sic science and technology have already made a profound impact on the investi-
gation and prosecution of crimes and alleged miscarriages of justice. This trend
is bound to continue. The leading comparative law scholar, Mirjan Damaska, has
predicted:
Let there be no mistake. As science continues to change the social world, great transfor-
mations of factual inquiry lie ahead for all justice systems. These transformations could
turn out to be as momentous as those that occurred in the twilight of the Middle Ages,
when magical forms of proof retreated before the prototypes of our present evidentiary
technology.8

will simply appear in argument without any formal request that they be noticed.
Many will fall under the doctrine of judicial notice (see below). Others may require
some proof, but all share the characteristic that they will be accepted as largely
indisputable at the time and place of the trial.9
e. Experience-based generalizations
Sometimes people conﬁdently claim to “know” something on the basis of ﬁrsthand
experience. Some such experience-based generalizations may be widely shared in
a community. Some may be based on extensive ﬁrsthand experience (Llewellyn’s
idea of “horse sense”).10 Most Miami residents have learned from experience that
torrential rain showers may fall with little advance indication. Others are individual
generalizations, based on isolated events, sometimes involving unwarranted extrap-
olations from individual experiences. For example, someone who has been unfairly
treated by the police may, rightly or wrongly, conclude that all or most police ofﬁcers
are not to be trusted. If the individual is a juror, the generalization may affect the
outcome, irrespective of its validity. Someone who has had an unpleasant experi-
ence with someone from another race or class may develop negative views about all
members of that race or class. Such beliefs are best treated as unwarranted beliefs
or prejudices rather than as being genuinely based on experience.
f. Synthetic-intuitive generalizations (belief generalizations)
Many “common sense” generalizations can be usefully categorized as beliefs that a
person synthesizes or intuits from her stock of knowledge and beliefs. Sometimes an
individual can explain the sources from which she synthesized the generalization.
Frequently, however, the intuitive predominates – the individual cannot identify
the source of the generalization or explain why she believes that it is sound.
The generalizations necessary to support the inferences that ﬂight from the scene
of a crime is evidence of guilt are examples of “synthetic-intuitive” generalizations.
We are not aware of any tests that claim to have veriﬁed these generalizations.
Nonetheless, the generalization “persons who have committed a crime often ﬂee
from the scene of that crime” seems intuitively right – at least to some middle class
people.11 In its weakest form, we might accept the transposed generalization upon
9 Of course, what passes for knowledge in a given society at a particular time may later be shown
to be untrue. For example, in an earlier era, it was “generally known” that the earth was ﬂat.
In an appropriate case, evidence that a person was on a ship that was last seen sailing over
the horizon might have been sufﬁcient to establish that the person was dead. To talk of beliefs
“passing for” knowledge at different times involves no commitment to a strong relativist position
in epistemology. On “the passes for fallacy” (the fallacy that because what passes for the truth is
often no such thing, it follows that there is no objective truth), see Haack (1998) 93.
10 “Horse-sense is the kind of highly informed, distinctly uncommon, better-than-common, expert
but not scientiﬁcally demonstrable know-what and know-how which a David Harum had about
horses and other horse-traders” (Llewellyn, unpublished manuscript (1950) cited in Twining
(1973) 503).
11 Note that if someone sees another person running in the vicinity of an event, such as a ﬁght or
motor accident, to call it “ﬂight” involves an inference: the person could be running to somewhere

which ﬂight inferences depend, “persons who ﬂee from the scene of a crime are
sometimes persons who are guilty of that crime.” The generalization thus framed
could provide only weak support for an inference that the person seen ﬂeeing from
the scene of a speciﬁc crime was the person who committed that crime: “That
person may be the person who committed the crime.” There often seems to be no
clear basis for our acceptance of these generalizations, apart from a synthesis or an
intuition based upon our personal “stock of knowledge” or “common sense.” This
is clearly fallible, but it may be all that we have to rely on.12
One of the claims for Wigmorean analysis is that by making explicit what is
usually left implicit it readily exposes weak points in argument. In marking stu-
dents’ exercises in this kind of analysis, we regularly look for non sequiturs in their
arguments. Very often the non sequitur is based on a faulty generalization, like the
one in Figure 10.2.
X was carrying a weapon. 
X entered the victim's garage.
G: Persons/strangers who enter other 
persons' garages usually/often/frequently 
carry weapons.
Figure 10.2 Foolish generalizations
This generalization, once articulated, would seem absurd on its face to most
people. Constructing generalizations to show disconnects in chains of reasoning is
a very useful device when evaluating an argument.
(e.g. to summon help), running from the scene or running past it, for example, a jogger who
happened to be passing near the scene of the event when it happened. Some people might interpret
running from the police as good sense rather than an indication of guilt.
12 A fairly representative statement of the orthodox view is as follows: “More often assumed than
articulated is the premise that jurors must rely on common sense, or the knowledge and experience
which they share with the community generally. But ‘common sense’ is frequently wrong . . . Our
everyday experience of the world comes in crude, unrepresentative chunks, with causal relations
hopelessly obscured, and with prejudice, superstition, and self-interest inextricably intertwined
in perception” (Bitterman (1956) A-16). “This is no argument for not using common sense. We
operate in judicial institutions with the best we have and the inescapable necessity of making
concessions to the shortness of life” (Levin and Levy (1956) 141–42).

4. Judicial notice and cognitive consensus
a. Judicial notice
In most jurisdictions there are rules concerning “judicial notice,” that is to say “facts
which need not to be proved.” For example, the Federal Rule 201(b) provides: “A
judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is
either (1) generally well known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or
(2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy
cannot reasonably be questioned.” Similarly a leading treatise on the law of evidence
in England and Wales states:
A judge may take judicial notice of facts which are matters of common knowledge and
which could not be the subject of serious dispute. Hence it would be pointless and
wasteful to require evidence of them. Hypothetical possibilities of notorious facts are
limitless: textbook writers frequently cite as illustrations the date of Christmas and the
death of Queen Victoria as facts which would be judicially noticed. Reported cases
contain many examples. The courts have taken judicial notice of the fact that by the
laws of nature, a fortnight is too short a period for human gestation; that cats are kept
for domestic purposes; that London streets carry a large volume of trafﬁc, so that a boy
employed to ride a bicycle through them runs a risk of injury; that the reception of
television is a common feature of domestic life enjoyed primarily for the purposes of
recreation; and that one of the popular forms of entertainment on television is a series
of reconstructed trials which have a striking degree of realism. (Dennis (2002) 424–45.
Citations omitted)
The idea of judicial notice should not be confused with background knowledge
or “common sense generalizations.” It is both wider and narrower. It is wider in that
it includes knowledge of speciﬁc facts (that Lima is the capital of Peru; that the old
Sumter Inn is nine miles from Hadley) (above, page 13). It is narrower because a
great deal of “common sense” or “society’s stock of knowledge” is not well founded
and its accuracy can reasonably be questioned.
Once articulated, many “common sense generalizations” appear dubious on
their face or are open to challenge on a variety of grounds. If so, they technically
fall outside the scope of the doctrine of judicial notice. But in practice prosecutors,
plaintiffs, defense counsel, and courts regularly rely on such beliefs, not because
they are well founded, but because there is no practicable alternative.
b. Cognitive consensus
Writers on evidence talk of “a stock of knowledge” and tend to postulate a high
degree of “cognitive consensus.” The following passage deserves to be treated as the
locus classicus for this view:
The inductivist analysis, [. . . ] presupposes only that when a juryman takes up his
ofﬁce his mind is already adult and stocked with a vast number of commonplace
generalizations about human acts, attitudes, intentions, etc., about the more familiar

Analysis of Evidence
features of the human environment, and about the interactions between these two
kinds of factors, together with an awareness of many of the kinds of circumstances that
are favourable or unfavourable to the application of each such generalization. Without
this stock of information in everyday life he could understand very little about his
neighbours, his colleagues, his business competitors, or his wife. He would be greatly
handicapped in explaining their past actions or predicting their future ones. But with
this information he has the only kind of background data he needs in practice for
the assessment of inductive probabilities in the jury-room. He does not need to have
tacitly ingested a mass of quantitative or numerical statistics for this purpose. Nor does
he need implicitly to remember some sophisticated mathematical algorithm in order
to compute the probabilities from the data. The inductive probability of the proposed
conclusion on the facts before the court depends just on the extent to which the facts are
favourable to some commonplace generalizations that connect them to the conclusion.
Not that jurymen are incapable of disagreeing with one another in their assessment
of the probability with which a proposed conclusion has been proved from undisputed
facts. But on any rational reconstruction of their disagreement (when prejudice, per-
sonal sympathy, sectional spite, and other irrational factors may be disregarded) the
disagreement must normally be due to differences of opinion about the kinds of cir-
cumstances that are favourable or unfavourable to the application of some particular
common sense generalization. The main commonplace generalizations themselves are
for the most part too essential a part of our culture for there to be any serious disagree-
ment about them. They are learned from shared experiences, or taught by proverb,
myth, legend, history, literature, drama, parental advice, and the mass media. When
people ceased to believe that those who had insensitive areas of skin were in commerce
with the Devil, it was symptomatic of a major cultural change. Similarly, so long as the
jurymen at a criminal trial are the accused’s peers his case has a reasonable chance of
being judged correctly by them, while if they belong to a different culture they are more
likely to misjudge it even when trying to be fair. But there is still room for occasional
disagreement, even within the same culture, about the kinds of circumstances that
are favourable or unfavourable to the application of some particular common sense
generalization. (L. Jonathan Cohen (1977) 274–76)
This passage has been criticized as presenting a rather complacent view about
common sense generalizations. It should be apparent that Cohen is making an
argument based on a collection of general knowledge and synthetic-intuitive gen-
eralizations that he assumes are so widely shared among the audience of scholars,
lawyers, and judges to whom the argument is addressed that they do not merit fur-
ther documentation or development. The main criticisms that have been advanced
can be summarized as follows:13
First, Cohen assumes that all jurors (and defendants) are male or sexless. But
even within a given culture and class a cross-gender cognitive consensus cannot
always be assumed on such matters as domestic violence, rape, equal pay, or more
generally. Moreover, in a dynamic multi-class, multi-cultural society one cannot

275
assume an extensive cognitive consensus across classes or cultures or even within
cultures. The idea of a cognitive consensus involving a common stock of knowledge
or beliefs is highly problematic.14
Second, and perhaps most important, standard versions of inferential reasoning
are species of propositional logic. One infers conclusions from premises that are
expressed as propositions. When we talk of “background generalizations” as the
warrants or the glue in this kind of argument, there is a tendency to assume that
we draw these from our stock of knowledge as ready-made propositions. But this
is psychologically implausible. Instead an individual’s or a community’s stock of
beliefs is unlikely to be stored in the form of a neatly categorized code or data base:
A “stock of knowledge” does not consist of individual, empirically tested, and readily
articulated propositions: rather, both individually and collectively, we have ill deﬁned
agglomerations of beliefs that typically consist of a complex soup of more or less
well-grounded information, sophisticated models, anecdotal memories, impressions,
stories, myths, proverbs, wishes, stereotypes, speculations, and prejudices. Fact and
value are not sharply differentiated. Nor are fact, fantasy and ﬁction. Nor can one take
for granted either consistency or coherence within an individual’s or a society’s “stock
of knowledge.” (Twining (1999) 362; Bazaar, 456)
Third, insofar as an individual’s or a group’s stock of beliefs is like a bouillabaisse,
it does not seem like an environment conducive to maintaining clear distinctions
between is and ought, fact and value. Stereotypes, proverbs, and stories typically
have an evaluative element – that is often their main point.15 Cohen’s formulation
does not make sufﬁcient allowance for the relationship between values and facts
in this kind of context – the inﬂuence of bias, prejudice, values, and so on, on
perceptionsofsocialfacts.Cohenassumesthatempiricalgeneralizationscanreadily
be distinguished from judgments of value.
Fourth, the statement is over-simple in other respects; for example, it does not
distinguishamongdifferentexamplesofgeneralizationsinrelationtotheirscientiﬁc
status or empirical base, their level of generality, or the extent to which they are
“purely” factual or contain other components – speculative or evaluative. So too, it
does not adequately distinguish among ﬁrmly held beliefs, matters on which people
have vague ideas, matters on which they are open to suggestion, and matters on
which they are agnostic or would register as “don’t knows.”
Soweneedtorecognizethattheideaofacognitiveconsensusinvolvingacommon
stock of knowledge or beliefs is highly problematic. However, Cohen’s position can
be defended up to a point. He allows that there is not a social consensus about every-
thing; that the stock of knowledge is relative to a given society, and by implication to
14 In the context of “globalization” the idea can be extended beyond a plural or a multi-cultural
society to the point that for many purposes we can no longer treat societies, countries, or nations
as self-contained units with clear and stable boundaries. However, John Rawls’s useful idea of an
overlapping consensus can be used to curb tendencies to exaggerate the extent to which stocks of
belief in fact vary across “cultures” (Rawls (1987); discussed GLT 69–75).

Analysis of Evidence
particular subgroups within a society; and that the stock of knowledge can change
over time. He points to the notion that with collegial decision-making, especially by
a jury, the stock of knowledge is a pool drawn from all the members’ “experience.”16
Moreover,incertainkindsofdecision-making,thetriersoffactsareselectedbecause
of their special knowledge and/or values, for example, in jury selection, at least in
the American system. So too, in arbitration it is typical to choose people for their
expertise – that is, some special subcategory of general experience, or to choose
people because of their biases or absence of bias or because they represent certain
kinds of interests, with a view to having a balanced panel that may ﬁnd a middle
way – for instance, one trade unionist, one representative of management, and one
“neutral” (who may or may not be an expert).
From the standpoint of the lawyer, both the view and the criticisms are impor-
tant. Lawyers must identify from the evidence what generalizations may affect the
decision-makers and how commonly and strongly held these generalizations are
likely to be among them. They must rely in part upon their own stock of knowledge
as members of the community, such knowledge about the speciﬁc decision-makers
as they can legitimately acquire through voir dire or otherwise, and such additional
knowledge as they may be able to acquire by study.
5. Dangers of generalizations
As Sidgwick observed, linking generalizations are often the main source of doubt in
an argument. One of the claims for the chart method is that by forcing articulation
of what is being (or might be) argued, one can more readily spot weak points in the
argument.17 In the course of discussion we have seen some examples of weak gen-
eralizations. Here is a summary list of some of the main weaknesses one can expect,
especially in relation to experience based and synthetic-intuitive generalizations.
Generalizations are dangerous18
Generalizations are dangerous in argumentation about doubtful or disputed ques-
tions of fact because they tend to provide invalid, illegitimate, or false reasons for
accepting conclusions based on inference. They are especially dangerous when they
are implicit or unexpressed. For example:
i The warranting generalization may be indeterminate in respect of:
a frequency or universality (all/most/some);
b level of abstraction;
c defeasibility (exceptions, qualiﬁcations);
d precision or “fuzziness”;
16 Some support for the consensus idea is to be found in writings about the jury in which research
suggests that the tendency is toward consensus formation in that kind of decision-making (Abbott
and Ball (eds.) (1999) Ch. 20).
17 A useful technique for showing the weakness of an argument is to show that it relies on a general-
ization that, once articulated, is obviously foolish (see above, page 272).

e empirical base/conﬁdence (accepted by scientiﬁc community; part of everyday
ﬁrsthand/vicarious experience, speculative, etc.);
ii It may be unclear as to identity (which generalization? There may be rival
generalizations available to each side in a dialogue), or source (whose generalization?
e.g. male/female experience in domestic violence cases).
iii When articulated, a generalization may be expressed in value-laden language or in
loaded categories.
iv There are several reasons for treating such ideas as “common-sense generalizations”
and “society’s stock of knowledge” with great caution.
Some of the more obvious ones are as follows:
a By no means all the beliefs in a social stock of knowledge will satisfy even quite relaxed
tests of warranted beliefs. What passes as common sense is often easily shown to be
untrue.
b A high degree of consensus about the contents of the social stock of knowledge or
beliefs cannot be taken for granted, especially in a plural or a stratiﬁed society. The
extent of cognitive consensus varies according to time and place.
c What is commonly referred to as a society’s “stock of knowledge” typically consists of
a complex mixture of “scientiﬁc facts,” impressionistic beliefs, stereotypes, myths,
proverbs, and so on. Value judgments (including prejudices, racist or gender
stereotypes) may be masquerading as empirical propositions.19
d The content of a “stock of knowledge” does not consist solely or mainly of
ready-made generalizations, still less of empirical generalizations. Beliefs may be
embedded in stories, examples, experience, etc., which are particular and which may
not have been articulated in general terms. There is often considerable indeterminacy
about what moral or general lesson or other generalization(s) may or will be
extrapolated from such material.
e What ofﬁcials, including courts, are prepared to recognize as “common sense” may
not correspond with what most people in a given society in fact believe. Even in an
open society some beliefs may be repressed as not being socially acceptable, politically
correct, or otherwise proper. A regime may be “in advance” of public opinion in
respect of such matters as gender, race, or class or vice versa. In repressive societies
ofﬁcial versions of the truth may diverge very substantially from what people in fact
believe.
6. Generalizations: the practitioner’s standpoint
Evaluating the strength of an argument or assessing the net persuasive effect of the
evidence as a whole ordinarily depends upon the signiﬁcant generalizations that the
decision-maker will or can be persuaded to apply. In all cases the decision-maker(s)
will bring an array of generalizations (i.e. a stock of beliefs) that will affect and
may control decisions of disputed questions of fact. It is accordingly important
that lawyers identify generalizations that will or may play a role in a case and how

Analysis of Evidence
that role can be most effectively enhanced or minimized. This requires that they
identify how signiﬁcant generalizations will enter the case; for instance, through
the evidence or as part of the knowledge and beliefs that the fact-ﬁnder brings to
the case. It is the latter that presents the more difﬁcult practical and theoretical
questions.
In preparing an argument for a decision-maker, the lawyer must ﬁrst identify
and appraise the most signiﬁcant generalizations that are available to either side to
enhance or diminish the strength or force of the potential arguments. Ordinarily,
thisposesnospecialdifﬁcultywithrespecttowhatwehaveclassiﬁedasscientiﬁcand
as general knowledge generalizations. The questions whether a claimed scientiﬁc
generalization is well accepted or whether the evidence and an opinion necessary to
establish it as a basis for argument are admissible poses questions of a kind that are
familiar to lawyers and judges.20 Similarly, generalizations that are truly accepted
on the basis of general knowledge in the relevant community must be viewed as
established or simply shown and thus as operative in the case. The challenge here is
for the advocate to use or to counter such generalizations effectively. The remaining
kinds of generalizations present different and more subtle problems.
a. Case-speciﬁc generalizations
The advocate typically must confront several problems with case-speciﬁc general-
izations. They must ﬁrst be identiﬁed and then decisions must be made to appraise
the likelihood that the evidence that will invoke them will be admitted. Facts of the
sort that Edith was 28 and Freddie was 20 will either be admitted or be apparent
to the trier of fact. The facts that Freddie had long been employed as a clerk on
ocean-going ships and that he was in fact carrying a knife on the evening of the
murder are almost certainly going to be admitted in evidence at some stage of the
proceedings.Itisthelawyer’sjobtoidentifythepossiblebackgroundgeneralizations
these facts may evoke and to decide how they may be shaped and used in argument.
In contrast, it is not clear whether evidence of Richard Able’s cocaine use or the
extent to which evidence concerning the events at the disco and those surrounding
his cashing the $25,000 check at a gambling casino will be admitted. Able’s lawyer
must not only identify the possible generalizations that would be evoked, but must
also plan arguments that confront the various contingencies.
b. Experience-based and synthetic-intuitive generalizations
Experience-based and synthetic-intuitive generalizations raise the same problems,
but they also pose an additional difﬁculty. A lawyer may be able to gather in advance
of trial signiﬁcant information about the individual judge’s experience and about
signiﬁcant beliefs and biases that may inﬂuence that judge’s perception of the evi-
dence. In a case tried by a jury, however, the problem is more complex. The lawyer’s
primary opportunity to learn about and shape the experience-based and belief

generalizations likely to inﬂuence the trial outcome will occur during jury voir dire
and selection.
c. Formulation and appraisal
Inadditiontoproblemsofidentiﬁcationandappraisal,however,thereistheproblem
of formulation. This is a problem common to generalizations of all types, and it is
peculiarly a problem that lawyers can shape through argument. The formulation of
thegeneralizationcan vary in a number of respects: Itcanbeframedasauniversalor
as a propensity statement or as something less than that (see above); it can be stated
with varying degrees of precision; it can be stated at different levels of generality; it
may contain an explicit or implicit judgment of value; the choice of words may be
relatively neutral or mildly or strongly emotive; there may be expressed or implied
exceptions or qualiﬁcations.
For the lawyer, the choice of formulation is crucial. The precise, speciﬁc formu-
lation may set up an irrebuttable syllogism compelling the conclusion sought, if the
decision-maker accepts the generalization in that form as true. But in most cases,
the generalization will not be either that well established or that widely shared and
will probably be defeasible. No one believes that “All older women dominate all
younger men all of the time,” and some potential jurors would probably reject such
a generalization in its weakest form.
In analyzing a generalization that plays a potentially important role in an argu-
ment one can adopt a procedure similar to doing a detailed microscopic analysis of
a selected phase of an argument for a Wigmorean chart: clarify standpoint; specify
the proposition to be justiﬁed; specify the proposition or propositions offered as
the basis for its justiﬁcation; identify and articulate the generalization(s) on which
the justiﬁcation depends; submit the generalization(s) to the various tests that have
been discussed above.21 Perhaps the main points can usefully be synthesized into a
rough working protocol as follows:
Protocol for assessing the plausibility and validity of a
generalization in the context of an argument
Standpoint: counsel for defense (pre-trial) in respect of an opponent’s potential
generalization
1 Will the generalization be stated expressly or merely implied?
A. Express
2 If expressly, is it precise?
3 Is it ambiguous?
4 Is it stated as a universal or is it qualiﬁed by a hedge as to frequency
(usually/often/sometimes)?

B. Stories necessary, but dangerous
We have seen in Chapter 6 that stories and story telling are central to fact determi-
nation. A well-grounded story is crucial to organizing and presenting a persuasive
argument. But like generalizations, story telling is vulnerable to abuse. It may be
true that stories and story telling are psychologically necessary to decision-making
in legal contexts, but they are dangerous in that they often can be used to violate
logical standards, appeal to emotion rather than reason, and subvert legal principles
and conventions.
Empirical research by Bennett and Feldman (1981), Pennington and Hastie
(1993), and others suggests that American juries determine “the truth” about
alleged past events mainly by constructing and comparing stories rather than crit-
ically evaluating arguments from evidence. These ﬁndings have been conﬁrmed in
other disciplines (e.g., medical diagnosis and history) and extended to fact deter-
mination by legal professionals and the police (e.g., Wagenaar et al. (1993)). Sim-
ply put, the widely accepted thesis is that human beings need stories in order
to make certain kinds of decisions and, more generally, to make sense of the
world.
The literature is less clear about the exact functions of story construction and
comparison. Bennett and Feldman say they are used to ﬁll in gaps; others suggest in
ordertobesatisﬁed,triersoffactneedtoexplainhumanmotivationandaction,even
whenmotiveisnotamaterialfact,orwhenthefactstobedeterminedrelatetoastatic
situation or a single “simple” fact such as identity. There is scope for disagreement
as to whether stories are psychologically necessary in all situations involving fact
determination in legal contexts (e.g., identity in a motiveless murder), but there
seems to be a consensus that they are in practice felt to be very important a great
deal of the time.
Story telling can also be shown to be dangerous in legal contexts in that it can
be, and is often, used to violate or evade conventional legal norms about relevance,

281
reliability, completeness, prejudicial effect, etc.22 It is widely regarded as appealing
to intuition and emotion and as a vehicle for “irrational means of persuasion.”
Examples of such dangers include:23
i sneaking in irrelevant facts;
ii sneaking in invented or ungrounded facts;
iii suggesting facts by innuendo;24
iv focusing attention on the actor rather than the act;25
v appealing to hidden prejudices or stereotypes;
vi telling the story in emotionally toned language;
vii telling a story that may win sympathy for the speaker or the victim but is irrelevant
to the argument;
viii making use of dubious analogies;
ix subverting lawyers’ distinctions between fact, law, and disposition and, more
generally, fact and value; and
x good stories pushing out true stories.26
Most of these points are illustrated in the materials in Chapter 1 and in the
questions and exercises at the end of this chapter. As with generalizations, one
can develop a rough working protocol for testing the plausibility, coherence, and
evidentiary support for a story, based upon the following questions:
Protocol for assessing the plausibility, coherence, and evidentiary
support for a story
Standpoint: counsel (on either side) preparing for trial
Is the story fully articulated? Or is it largely implied? If so, what exactly is the story?
If articulated:
Is the story internally consistent?
Is there any evidence in this case that seems to conﬂict with the story?
To what extent does the evidence in the case support this story?
Are there any elements in the story not supported by evidence? To what extent are
they based on speculation?
Does the story sneak in expressly or by innuendo:
Any irrelevant facts
Any invented facts
Any inadmissible facts?
22 Such norms include: judge the act not the actor; consider only relevant evidence; argue from
evidence, not speculation; and keep separate questions of fact, law, and disposition.
23 For a detailed account see Rethinking Ch. 7, Bazaar Chs. 12–16.
24 See Ch. 1, B 4 Sam’s Party.
25 To give a simple example: at common law, evidence of disposition or bad character (such as prior
convictions) is not normally admissible to support a criminal charge, but character is often an
important but implicit part of a story (FRE 404–6). On the changes introduced in England by the
Criminal Justice Act, 2003 see Roberts and Zuckerman (2004) 511–15; on the controversy behind
these changes, see Zander (2003) 413–22.

Analysis of Evidence
Can the story be told in a neutral way or does it expressly or impliedly involve value
judgments?
Does it appeal to hidden prejudices or stereotypes?
Does the story ﬁt some familiar story, such as Cinderella or the parable of the Prodigal
Son or Lady Macbeth? If so, what is the relevance of this?
Does the story cast any of the actors in a bad light in a way that subverts the principle:
judge the act, not the actor?
Does the telling of the story distort the facts so that a good story (entertaining, funny,
exciting etc.) squeezes out a less interesting true story?
Does the story purport to “make sense” of the original episode or the motivation of
one or more principal actors?
Is the story calculated to win sympathy for the victim/complainant/accused beyond
what is supported by particular evidence?
Insofar as the story goes beyond the data, is it supported by plausible background
generalizations?27
C. The relationship between stories and generalizations
If generalizations and stories are both necessary, but dangerous, how are they con-
nected? It might be objected that the two theses apply to different spheres of dis-
course. Generalizations are logically necessary in the context of rational argument;
stories are psychologically necessary in the context of human decision making. The
logical “dangers” are different from the dangers of poor “judgment.”
The relationship between logic and psychology in relation to decision-making
is a very large subject. Here, we conﬁne ourselves to two points. First, some of
the functions of story telling are to do with human interaction and communi-
cation, and are not performing a function in an argument. For example, in oral
presentation by an advocate, stories may legitimately be used to attract and retain
interest, set a comprehensible context, and provide concrete illustrations to assist
understanding. They may, of course, be used to distract attention or win sym-
pathy for the speaker or the victim independently of what is at issue and so on.
So, some of the functions and dangers are to do with communication rather than
argumentation.
However, stories also seem to have a place within arguments and questions can be
asked about the legitimacy, validity, or cogency of their place in this context. Some
of the allegations about the dangers of stories seem to be appealing to standards of
rationality. For example, a story-winning sympathy for the speaker independently
of the issue can be criticized as irrelevant to the argument; where a good story
27 In Anchored Narratives (1993) three Dutch psychologists, Wagenaar, Crombag, and Van Koppen,
usefully link stories and generalizations. However, they greatly exaggerate the importance of gen-
eralizations as direct “anchors” for stories, for generalizations should only be used to play this role
in the absence of particular evidence to support the story. Particular evidence will nearly always
give stronger support than a background generalization. A story is as vulnerable to attack as the
generalizations that support it. See further Bazaar Ch. 13.

pushes out a true story, it can be criticized on the ground its attraction is to do with
something other than truth (e.g., excitement, reassurance, titillation), and undue
weight is being given to it. (See Bazaar Ch. 14.) Where a story is used to ﬁll in gaps in
the evidence, its justiﬁcatory force may be little or none, and it seems odd to claim
that an argument about a question of fact is bolstered by claiming the situation is
analogous to a work of ﬁction or a parable (Bazaar Ch. 16).
One version of this position may be restated as follows: In ordinary life and
in making important decisions we need stories in order to “make sense” of the
world and of particular past events; in factual inquiries, including adjudication,
for a story to be accepted as true it needs to be warranted by (or anchored in)
evidence. A well-formed story needs to be coherent, but to be true, it must be both
plausible and backed by particular evidence. Plausibility is tested by background
generalizations; the truth of speciﬁc factual conclusions is tested by reasoning from
particular evidence.
There are also important examples, mainly in the Anglo-American literature on
advocacy and adjudication, of claims that stories play a crucial role not merely in
respect of presentation and rhetoric, but analytically as part of an argument. For
instance, in a much cited paper, John W. Davis maintained, “in an appellate court
the statement of the facts is not merely a part of the argument, it is more often than
not the argument itself” (Davis (1953) 181). Similar statements have been made
by Karl Llewellyn, James Boyd White, and other American jurists.28 The precise
meanings of such statements are not always clear, but it is reasonable to interpret
them as maintaining that such notions as stories need to be accommodated within
a conception of rational argument in legal contexts. Such claims are controversial,
but if, for the sake of argument, we accept them as plausible, the question remains:
What is the relationship between stories and generalizations in this context?
Perhaps the main link lies in the idea of “a stock of knowledge.” As we have seen, a
“stock of knowledge” does not consist of individual, empirically tested, and readily
articulated propositions, still less of empirical laws.29 Beliefs may be embedded
in stories, examples, and experiences that are particular and may not have been
articulated in general terms. There is often considerable indeterminacy about what
moral or general lesson or other generalization(s) may or will be extrapolated from
such material.
Generalizations may be indeterminate as to their application; stories may be
indeterminate as to their signiﬁcance. There is an intimate interaction between the
general and the particular in all arguments about questions of fact. One aspect of
the relationship between generalizations and stories can be usefully analyzed with
greater precision. Generalizations are, by deﬁnition, general; stories are particular.30
There is, as every lawyer knows, an intimate relationship between general rules and
particular cases. Similarly, as every theologian and moralist should know, there is

Analysis of Evidence
an intimate relationship between parables (and other morality tales) and their
signiﬁcance. That signiﬁcance can be expressed in such terms as the point or
the moral or some other general lesson or idea that it illustrates. Stories appeal
strongly to the imagination. Part of that appeal lies in their concreteness and
their particularity. That power can be undermined if the moral or point is spelled
out or otherwise made explicit. Why this should be so is crucial in the present
context.
The idea of precedent as a source of law is an especially clear illustration of
the interaction between the general and the particular.31 Because precedents are
especially important in the common law, there has been much theorizing and
controversy about “the problem of the ratio decidendi.” We need not venture into
that old controversy here because on several relevant points there is widespread
agreement. “The facts” of a case are particular. The facts, at least in a hard case,
give rise to a question of law. Such questions of law should be expressed in general
terms, not “Is the defendant guilty or liable?” but “In circumstances of this type,
is the defendant guilty or liable?” In deciding the particular case, the court gives
an authoritative answer to the question(s) of law. That answer may be explicit or
implicit.
The relationship between the facts, the issue(s), and the answer can be formally
restated as follows: the facts = X happened; the issue = if X happens, then what?
(legal consequence); the answer = whenever X happens, then Y.
In this formulation X is a constant despite the transition from particular to
general.Thistransitionfromaparticularsituationtogeneralquestionsandageneral
answer involves a shift from “this was the situation” to “in situations of this type,
the law prescribes . . . ” The crucial point in this context is that X is a constant. In
short, X=X=X.
One of the main problems in interpreting cases is that the level of generality of
X is indeterminate. The same applies to “the moral” of parables and morality tales.
But if the facts are known, and if X=X=X, how can X be clear at the particular
level, but unclear at the general level? The answer is, of course, that how exactly the
facts are to be categorized is also indeterminate. X represents a particular situation
seen as a type. How precisely that situation should be interpreted, what elements
are material, and what is the best or an appropriate description of the situation
is a matter of interpretation. And, since X=X=X, the problem of interpreting X is
almost constant.32
Descriptions of situations are typically expressed in language. The choice of
language is not signiﬁcant solely because of the more or less obvious rhetorical
potential of emotive or value laden terms. For example, a categorization may be
judged appropriate because it reﬂects the way a signiﬁcant reference group thinks or
talks (for instance, using the concepts of a particular trade to describe the situation
in a commercial case), or because it corresponds with or ﬁts, explicitly or implicitly,

some general principle or policy (for example describing a situation in a way that
bringsoutthatanon-expertwasrelyingonthejudgmentofanexpertinareasonably
proximate relationship).33 This idea of choosing appropriate categories to describe
particular fact situations is at the core of Karl Llewellyn’s important, but elusive,
idea of “situation sense.” 34
Some of the alleged “dangers” of stories shared with generalizations include,
for example, presenting unsupported facts as if they were anchored or appealing
explicitly or implicitly to biases or prejudices. Perhaps the most obvious common
element is indeterminacy: Indeterminacy as to what exactly is being argued or is the
general signiﬁcance of the particular example. For example, what precisely is the
moral of the parable of the prodigal son? Indeterminacy is generally presented as a
weakness in an argument. But, as John Wisdom points out, one of the attractions
of case by case argument is that one is not forced to deﬁne the boundaries of X in
advance.35 It can be valid and sensible to say, “This is a clear case of X” without
deﬁning X. That is part of the key to understanding the attraction of precedent
at common law. It is a form of argument by analogy which does not commit the
arguer to a position beyond what is needed for the case at hand.
D. Generalizations, stories, and themes: questions and exercises
The materials in Chapter 1 contain a great deal that is directly relevant to points
made about stories and generalizations in Chapter 3 and this chapter. At this
stage it may help to draw a lot of threads together by revisiting some of these
examples.
Generalizations
Review the material on the testimony of Ofﬁcer Connolly in the Sacco and Vanzetti
case (Ch. 1, C4a) to the effect that during his arrest Sacco attempted on several occa-
sions to put his hand under his overcoat in spite of being warned not to. Figure 10.3
is a reconstruction of the prosecution’s argument that Connolly’s testimony sup-
ported the conclusion that Sacco took part in the robbery and murder at South
Braintree on April 15, 1920. Each step in the chain of inferences involves an implicit
generalization as a warrant.36

imaginative reasoning that has led to identifying two suspects, but it is a long way from
proving the case against either of them. Assuming for the sake of argument that one of
the suspects is in fact the murderer, construct an account of his movements during the
past 24 hours that explains why he was in Hadley and why he made the remark about
the nine mile walk. Bear in mind that any alibi claims can probably be checked fairly
easily and that if he is caught lying this will weaken his position. Does the strategy of
your story rely mainly on denial (OD), rival (OR), or explanation (OE)?

small child; the Millers were not the only people who had complained about the

Stories and argument
In an appellate court, the statement of the facts is not merely a part of the argument, it
is more often than not the argument itself. (John W. Davis (1940))
It is trite that it is in the statement of facts that the advocate has his ﬁrst, best, and most
precious access to the court’s attention. The court does not know the facts, and it wants
to. It is trite among good advocates, that the statement of the facts can, and should in the
very process of statement, frame the legal issue, and can and should, simultaneously
produce the conviction that there is only one sound result. It is as yet less generally
perceived as a conscious matter that the pattern of the facts as stated must be a simple
pattern, with its lines of simplicity never lost under detail; else attention wanders, or
(which is as bad) the effect is submerged in the court’s effort to follow the presentation
or to organize the material for itself. (Karl Llewellyn (1962) 341–42)

Analysis of Evidence
[W]e can say that both the history and the tapestry are in this respect like a law case: the
lawyer knows that to prove his (or her) case he must not only demonstrate the truth or
probability of certain propositions of fact; he must present to the judge or juror a way
of looking at the cases as a whole that will make sense; and it must “make sense” not
merely as a matter of factual likelihood, but as a predicate to judgment, as a basis for
action. While a case can in a technical sense be refuted by disproving one element or
another, in practice the lawyer knows that he must do more than that: he must offer the
judge or juror an alternative place to stand, another way of making sense of the case as
a whole. To do his job, that is, the lawyer must both engage in an accurate retelling of
the facts and make his own claim for what they mean. (James Boyd White (1985) 160)

The principles of proof and the
law of evidence
A. Introduction
The purpose of this book is to provide a theoretical and practical foundation for
mastering some speciﬁc analytical skills relating to the construction and criticism
of arguments about disputed questions of fact. It is not a book about the law of
evidence, but a central theme has been that the principles of proof and the law
of evidence are intimately related. Like Wigmore, we believe that understanding
the principles of proof is a valuable, perhaps a necessary, foundation both for
understanding the rules and learning how to use them in practice.
At several points this interdependence has been made explicit. Chapters 1 and
2 illustrate the extent to which the two subjects share the same basic concepts:
for example, relevance, materiality, weight/probative force, admissibility, inference,
credibility, corroboration, prejudicial effect, and so on. In Chapter 3, we saw how
nearly all secondary writers on evidence, including all the leading treatise writers,
have worked within a framework of shared assumptions, which we called “The
Rationalist Tradition.” Those assumptions are common to the principles of proof
and the basic principles of the law of evidence in common law countries. We also
saw how relevance and weight are governed by “logic and general experience” rather
than formal rules and that relevance is the main test of admissibility of evidence.
As questions of admissibility are increasingly determined by exercise of judicial
discretion and application of balancing tests in the circumstances of a particular
case (for example the weighing of prejudicial effect against probative value), so
too the logic of proof and the practical operation of rulings on admissibility have
increasingly converged. In Chapter 8, we looked further at the idea that there are no
rules of weight, and we considered different standards of proof, review, and appeal
in the context of weighing evidence. In Chapter 10, we considered brieﬂy scientiﬁc
generalizations and judicial notice. All of these topics are central to understanding
the law of evidence.
In this chapter we will seek to synthesize these ideas by presenting a coherent
overview of the law of evidence as developed by Wigmore’s teacher, James Bradley
Thayer, and use this as a framework for integrating the principles of proof and
the technical rules of evidence. We then present an overview of the approach to

Analysis of Evidence
analyzing for admissibility under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The chapter ends
by proposing a general protocol for analyzing any problem of admissibility.
B. What is the law of evidence? A Thayerite overview1
In the Anglo-American tradition there have been four principal attempts to develop
an explicit general theory of the law of evidence. Gilbert tried to subsume all the
rules of evidence under a single principle, the “best evidence rule”;2 Bentham saw
the existing technical rules as an illogical and indefensible morass, and he argued
that there should be no binding rules at all within the framework of the Natural
System of Procedure; Stephen tried to ﬁnd a coherent rationale for the whole of the
law of evidence in the principle of relevancy. Thayer admired Stephen’s enterprise
but agreed with Sir Frederick Pollock’s judgment that it represented “a splendid
mistake.”3 Relevance was a matter of logic, not law and “The law has no mandamus
on the logical faculty.”4 Thayer treated the rules of evidence as a mixed group of
exceptions to a principle of freedom of proof.
Nearly all modern writers on evidence in the common law world have accepted
some version of Thayer’s thesis, and it has more or less explicitly provided the basis
for most subsequent attempts to codify this branch of the law, including the Federal
RulesofEvidence.5 Accordingly,Thayeristhenaturalstarting-pointforinterpreting
the current position.
The Thayerite conception of the law of evidence has a strikingly narrow focus.
It concerns processes in court; it is restricted to what facts may be presented to the
court by whom and the manner of their presentation. It is not directly concerned
with pre-trial and post-trial events. Over time, many topics previously included in
books on evidence were exiled to procedure, pleading, or substantive law and, in
the United States, to constitutional law. Underlying this conception are sharp dis-
tinctions between materiality, relevance, admissibility, and cogency, each of which
is governed by a different set of criteria. In constructing an argument on an issue of
fact, a four-stage intellectual procedure has to be followed, with each stage belong-
ing to a different sphere of discourse and allocated to a speciﬁc functionary. Thus
in a contested jury trial the standard pattern is as follows:
1 What are the facts to be proved? (Facts in issue, ultimate probanda, material facts are
all synonymous in this context.) This is the issue of materiality. It is governed by
substantive law and is to be determined by the judge.
2 Of any fact offered as evidence or potential evidence: Does this fact tend to support or
tend to negate one or more of the facts in issue? This is the question of relevance; it is
governed by logic and general experience, and is a matter for the judge.

3 Of any fact offered as evidence or potential evidence: Is there a rule or principle that
requires that this item of relevant evidence should be excluded or its use limited
because either
(a) it belongs to a class of inadmissible evidence; or
(b) it would be contrary to the policy of the law to admit this in the circumstances of
the case?
This issue of admissibility is governed by the law of evidence, and is a question for the
judge.
4 What weight should be given to this item of evidence (or the evidence as a whole) in
the circumstances of the case? This is the issue of evaluation of weight (or cogency or
probative force); it is governed by “logic and general experience,” and is a matter for
the jury or other trier of fact. An alternative interpretation is that the criteria for
weight of evidence are provided by probability theory, of which there are many
versions (see above, Chapter 9).
Thayer’ssurgicalnarrowingdownofthescopeofthelawofevidencewasinspired
ground-clearing.Hethenmoldedwhatremainedintoasimpleandcoherentsystem,
based on two principles:
(1) That nothing is to be received which is not logically probative of some matter
requiring to be proved; and
(2) that everything which is thus probative should come in, unless a clear ground of
policy of law excludes it.6
The ﬁrst principle (the test of relevance) is exclusionary, but it is not strictly speaking
part of the law of evidence: “It is not so much a rule of evidence as a presupposition
involved in the very conception of a rational system of evidence.”7 The second prin-
ciple is inclusionary and is the basic principle of the law of evidence. It mandates
the reception of evidence supposed to be logically relevant to the facts in issue,
subject to exceptions prescribed by law. The main role of technical rules of evidence
is to prescribe the scope of the exceptions to the general inclusionary principle.
Thayer’s explanation for the perceived complexity of the subject was essentially his-
torical. While the exclusionary rules were logically exceptions to a general principle
of inclusion, the historical process was different:
What has taken place, in fact, is the shutting out of the judges of one and another thing
from time to time; and so, gradually, the recognition of this exclusion under a rule.
These rules of exclusion have had their exceptions; and so the law has come into the
shape of a set of primary rules of exclusion; and then a set of exceptions to these rules.8
These exceptions, and exceptions to exceptions, were justiﬁed on disparate grounds:
Some things are rejectedasbeingoftooslightasigniﬁcance, or as having too conjectural
and remote a connection; others, as being dangerous in their effect on the jury, and
likely to be misused or overestimated by that body; others as being impolitic, or unsafe

Analysis of Evidence
on public grounds; others on the bare ground of precedent. It is this sort of thing, as I
said before – the rejection on one or other practical ground, of what is really probative –
which is the characteristic thing in the law of evidence; stamping it as a child of the jury
system.9
ThreepointsaboutThayer’sconceptionofthescopeofthelawofevidencedeserve
emphasis. First, the core of Thayer’s view of the law of evidence is concerned with
the regulation of reasoning about disputed questions of fact at trial.10 The law
of evidence consists mainly of artiﬁcial limitations on free enquiry and ordinary
reason in the process of arguing about and justifying decisions on such questions.
Since the law, by and large, leaves judgments about relevancy and weight to logic
and general experience, the “excluding function” is the main role of the law of
evidence.
Secondly, the converse of this last proposition is not the case. The law of evidence
is only one of several grounds for excluding evidence. In litigation the issues are
artiﬁcially and sharply deﬁned in advance by substantive law and pleading; histo-
rians, physical scientists, and others have no strong concept of materiality to limit
their enquiries in such ways. More evidence is excluded on grounds of irrelevance
than for any other reason; but relevance is a matter of logic, not law, even if lawyers
tend to interpret relevance more strictly than most. It should also be remembered
that Bentham, who wished to abolish all formal rules of evidence, was in favor of
exclusion of evidence if it was irrelevant or superﬂuous or its adduction would have
involved preponderant vexation, expense or delay judged by the standard of utility
in the circumstances of the case.
Thirdly, Thayer indicates that questions of weight are not and should not be
governed by rules of law, but they are subject only to “the ordinary rules of human
thought and experience, to be sought in the ordinary sources, and not in the
law books.”11 In short, the law prescribes almost no rules for the evaluation of
evidence.12
By and large, subsequent treatise writers and codiﬁers have followed Thayer in
accepting a fairly restrictive view of the law of evidence, but have followed Wigmore
in including all or most of the “borderline” topics, such as presentation of evidence,
burdens and presumptions, and appellate review.13

which presents a summary overview of the canons of Australian law of evidence in the spirit of
Thayer under nine basic heads. This is helpful in concretizing Thayer’s theory, but is not included
here as it does not represent modern US law in respect of a few speciﬁc details.

The principles of proof and the law of evidence
293
seem natural to start by elucidating the nature and scope of that principle, before
considering the exceptions. What, then, is “free proof”? In the present context, one
can give a relatively straightforward answer that ﬁts the Thayerite view of the law
of evidence. “Free proof” means an absence of formal rules that interfere with free
enquiry and natural or common sense reasoning. In the adversary system, where
the parties have primary control over what evidence is presented in what form and
what questions are or are not put to witnesses, the freedom of enquiry by judge,
jury, or other triers of fact is strictly limited. It is for the parties to determine whom
and what they see or hear, but not how they evaluate and reason from evidence.
This “freedom” is largely the freedom of the parties and to a lesser extent that of the
judge, jury, or trier of fact.14 This conception of “free proof” is entirely compatible
with the Thayerite picture of the law of evidence.
We saw in Chapter 3 that Thayer’s disciple, Wigmore, treated the principle of
proof and the law of evidence as two complementary parts of a single subject, what
he called judicial evidence. The principles of proof, said Wigmore, were anterior to
and more important than what he called the “Trial Rules.” It is worth revisiting both
elements in this claim. Wigmore argued that it was better to study the principles
of proof before studying the rules. This was not merely because it seems sensible
to study a basic principle before considering exceptions to it. More important, the
principles of proof are logically anterior to the law of evidence, as well as providing
many of their underlying rationales (insofar as they had a rational basis). Thayer
had made essentially the same point when he claimed that these two basic principles
of evidence (the exclusionary and inclusionary principles) were not so much part of
the law of evidence as necessary presuppositions of a rational system of evidence.15
The exclusion of irrelevant evidence was a matter of logic not law; and there was
a general presumption in favor of admitting all relevant evidence. In order to have
a clear view of the law of evidence, one needs ﬁrst to understand these two basic
principles of proof.
In our experience, Thayer and Wigmore have both been proved right, but like
many other teachers of evidence, we have extended the focus of attention beyond the
courtroom and the contested trial to cover allphases of litigation, from investigation
to post-trial decisions. This is not only because the law of evidence “casts a long
shadow,” but also because inferential reasoning is an important part of many pre-
and post-trial decisions. It is for this reason that we have adopted a “total process”
14 Thisis,ofcourse,ratherdifferentfromBentham’smodeloftheNaturalSystemofProcedure,which
was more inquisitorial in nature. Nevertheless, Bentham’s attack on all binding rules of evidence,
his “anti-nomian thesis,” provides the classic picture of a system of free proof in adjudication:
no rules excluding classes of witnesses or of evidence; no rules of priority or weight or quantum;
no binding rules as to form or manner of presentation; no artiﬁcial restriction on questioning or
reasoning; no right of silence or testimonial privileges; no restrictions on reasoning other than the
general principles of practical reason; no exclusion of evidence unless it is irrelevant or superﬂuous
or its adduction would involve preponderant vexation, expense, or delay in the circumstances of
the particular case. For a detailed discussion see Twining (1985) Ch. 2.

Analysis of Evidence
model of litigation (both civil and criminal) and have emphasized the importance
of differentiating the standpoints of different participants at different stages of legal
processes as well as of different kinds of outside observers.
C. One law of evidence?
Our approach in this book combines the ideal type of the Rationalist Tradition,
a total process model of litigation, principles of proof, methods of marshaling
arguments, and a substance-blind approach to the credentials of evidence, espe-
cially relevance, credibility, and probative force. It also deals with the relationship
between generalizations, narrative, and argument. All of these transcend differences
between evidentiary problems in civil, criminal, and other contexts. They represent
the general part of the study of evidence in law within the tradition of Thayer and
Wigmore. However, detailed study of the technical rules of evidence needs to be
sensitive to the differences between procedural and institutional contexts and to
the different rationales and policies underlying criminal and civil proceedings and
other kinds of litigation. Indeed, in most civil law systems the rules of evidence are
treated as part of procedure, and civil, criminal, and administrative procedural sys-
tems belong to different specialisms. In England, especially since the decline of the
civil jury, most courses on evidence focus almost exclusively on evidence in crim-
inal proceedings. One of the leading textbooks is now called Criminal Evidence.16
This trend has probably gone further in England than in most common law
countries.
IntheUnitedStates, the situation is more complexfortherehavebeenconﬂicting
trends. Evidence is still treated as a single subject in most books and courses, partly
because the jury is still important in civil cases and because the Federal Rules cover
both civil and criminal evidence. However, in dealing with questions of admissi-
bility and proof, constant attention must still be paid to the different underlying
principles, policies, and rationales of civil and criminal litigation. Furthermore,
the impact of constitutional law on criminal procedure has promoted the separa-
tion of civil and criminal evidence. However, some important constitutional issues
are treated more in courses on criminal procedure or constitutional law than in
courses on evidence, whereas in England the impact of the European Convention on
Human Rights and the Human Rights Act 1998 can hardly be ignored in a course on
evidence.
16 Roberts and Zuckerman (2004). Evidentiary issues arise in all types of proceeding, in all types
of legal processes and at every stage. However, Roberts argues that the subject becomes more
manageable and coherent if one focuses on one type of proceeding – viz. criminal process (Roberts
(2002)). We agree that it is desirable to integrate the law of civil and criminal evidence with their
differentproceduralcontexts,butwouldreiteratethatthelogicofproofishighlytransferableacross

stages of criminal process, intelligence scenarios, and other non-legal examples to emphasize this
transferability.

D. Linking the principles of proof and the law of evidence:
relevance as the main bridge
As we have seen, the logic of proof is an important element in studying, for exam-
ple, judicial notice, similar facts, prejudicial effect/probative value, burdens and
standards of proof (and for other decisions),17 and presumptions. The increasingly
important subject of scientiﬁc and expert evidence is a good peg on which to hang
some of the central epistemological questions concerning evidence.18 However,
the main bridge between fact analysis/the principles of proof and legal doctrine is
supplied by the topic of relevance because:
a Relevance is the most important mechanism of exclusion.
b The principles of proof are anterior to the other exclusionary rules because they deal
with the exclusion of relevant evidence. In other words, the question of relevance
needs to be determined as a preliminary to considering whether a particular
exclusionary rule applies to a particular item of potential evidence.
c To understand relevance involves understanding the principles and characteristics of
inferential reasoning.
d The law of evidence can be treated as a coherent whole by Thayer’s inclusionary and
exclusionary principles, which are expressed in terms of relevance within a basic
framework of argumentation.
Many modern course books treat relevance as the ﬁrst topic to be studied on the
lawofevidence.Theyoftendevotesubstantialspacetoit.Whilestayingwiththeidea
that relevance is the core of both the logic of proof and the rules of evidence, we have
tried in this book to present a broader and more coherent foundation to the study of
the rules. It is important that this should be more than just a preliminary topic to be
studied at the beginning of a course and then forgotten; rather the approach needs
to be an integral part of the detailed study of most standard topics in an evidence
course.19
E. Analyzing for admissibility20
The connection between the principles of proof and exclusionary rules is clear if we
think in terms of argumentation. If an item of evidence is inadmissible, this means
that it may not be part of an argument and so it has no place on the chart. The
17 On the broader concept of “standards for decision” see above, Ch. 8.
18 Roberts 324–28. The links between epistemology and scientiﬁc evidence have been brilliantly
explored by the philosopher Susan Haack. See especially Haack (2003) Ch. 9 and Haack (2004).
19 A similar point is made by Paul Roberts. In arguing for more attention to be paid to relevance, he
suggests that after a preliminary consideration at the start of a course, the lessons can be reinforced
by explicit consideration of it in relation to other topics such as previous misconduct evidence,
hearsay, and silence. (Roberts (2002) 306–7). See further Roberts and Zuckerman (2004), passim.
For an illustration see pages 341–43 below.
20 This heading echoes the title of the excellent Ch. 8 of Palmer (2004), which deals with this subject
in more detail but at a general level.

Analysis of Evidence
exclusionary rules tell us what may or may not be part of an argument. Since these
formal rules work to exclude relevant evidence, relevance is always a preliminary
issue. But relevance can only be determined in relation to a material fact or another
fact of consequence. In other words the ultimate and penultimate probanda need to
be established before either questions of exclusion because of irrelevance or other
grounds of inadmissibility can be determined.
Thus where an issue of admissibility arises, questions of relevance arise twice:
relevance to a fact of consequence and relevance to credibility. Often the initial
question of relevance may be unproblematic. For example, in a murder case a
confession, “I killed Charlie,” is obviously directly relevant to opportunity and
identity, though it may not tell us anything about criminal intent or a possible
defense. But the prosecution must ﬁrst lay a foundation, by introducing evidence
that the confession was voluntary.
Sometimes the argument can become quite complicated and it may be helpful to
use a Wigmorean approach to clarify an issue of admissibility. For instance, in the
case of R. v. George Joseph Smith (the brides in the bath murders) the prosecution
had plenty of evidence of motive and opportunity, but there was not much evidence
to support the propositions that Smith caused the death of Bessy Munday and that
he did so with criminal intent. The prosecution successfully argued that evidence of
the deaths of two other brides by drowning in similar circumstances was admissible.
ThepassagefromtheperorationintheclosingspeechbyThomasBodkinQCforthe
Crown is powerful as rhetoric, but it masks a quite complex argument.21 One can
reconstruct the argument in Wigmorean terms as follows: Standpoint: counsel for
the prosecution arguing that details of the deaths of two other brides are admissible.
Ultimate probandum: GJS murdered Bessie Munday.
1 GJS caused BM to die by drowning22
2 GJS acted with criminal intent
3 There was a large aggregation of resemblances between the deaths of BM and two
other recent brides
4 The aggregation of resemblances could not have occurred without design.
5 The combination of factors a–l is too uncommon to be a coincidence. (G)23
6 In all three cases factors a–l were present
21 See above, Ch. 1, C3a.
22 This could be disaggregated into two propositions relating to cause and identity: A person caused
BM’s death by drowning; it was GJS who caused BM’s death. Identity was not really in question
in the case.
23 The factors emphasized by Bodkin were (a) going through a form of marriage; (b) the ready money
of the woman was withdrawn or realized; (c) a will was drawn in favor of GJS absolutely; (d) the
will was drawn by a stranger to the testatrix; (e) the victim either insured her life or had property
that made this unnecessary; (f) there was a visit to a doctor, which was unnecessary given the
physical condition of the patient; (g) the woman wrote letters to relatives on the night before she
died or on the same night; (h) the prisoner was the ﬁrst to discover the drowning; (i) the door was
unfastened and the water was not drawn off until after the doctor had been; (j) the prisoner put
forward demonstrably that he had been shopping and absent from the house in which his wife was
lying dead; (k) the prisoner disappeared after the event; (l) the prisoner achieved or attempted to
achieve monetary advantage as a result of the death.

Several points are worth noting about this example. First, the argument about
design supports three material facts (causation, identity, and criminal intent). Sec-
ond, a crucial step in the argument involves a generalization about coincidence. In
this case, it seems very plausible, but arguments from coincidence are frequency
arguments that can easily be abused.24 Third, this case should be distinguished from
similar fact arguments that involve “propensity” as a step in the reasoning. Such
cases, which have caused a great deal of difﬁculty in all common law countries,
can also be usefully analyzed by the chart method.25 Here the argument was about
coincidence to support design and did not involve any reference to the character of
the accused. Today, such cases all need to be analyzed in terms of prejudicial effect
versus probative value.26 Fourth, part of the strength of the argument in this case
arises from a synergy between individual pieces of evidence: several of the common
factors support the proposition that Smith had so arranged things that he stood to
gain ﬁnancially, i.e. he had a motive, which further supports design, identity, and
intent.
At a general level one can analyze most issues of admissibility by asking four
questions, as follows:
1 Does this evidence raise a potential issue of admissibility? (e.g., evidence of
circumstances of two other murders.)
2 If so, what is the purpose for which it is being tendered? (To what fact(s) in issue is
this evidence relevant? In Smith both cause of death and criminal intent.)
3 What are the facts relevant to the question of admissibility of this evidence?
(Sometimes referred to as “foundational facts”; e.g., the facts that in each case factors
a–l were present.)
4 What evidence tends to prove the existence of the foundational facts? (e.g., the
evidence that factors a–l were present in Case I and Case II.)27
24 E.g., R. v. Clark [2003] E.W.C.A. Crim. 1020 (Sally Clark, multiple cot deaths, discussed in
Appendix I on the website).
25 See Acorn (1991).
26 See, however, the Criminal Justice Act 2003, sections 101 and 103: bad character is admissible
where “it is relevant to an important matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution,”
subject to a general condition of “fairness.” For a good discussion see Roberts and Zuckerman
(2004), suggesting that for most purposes this legislative intervention “reads like a convoluted
restatement of existing legal principles” (517).

F. Analysis under the United States Federal Rules of Evidence
The Federal Rules of Evidence, enacted as law in the United States (the “Federal
Rules”), provide a good vehicle to illustrate the relationship between analysis of
evidence and rules of evidence because all of the basic rules are prescribed in statu-
tory form in a uniﬁed code.28 Unlike most common law jurisdictions, the rules do
not have to be taken from separate codes regulating civil and criminal procedure or
distilled from piecemeal legislation or appellate decisions or treatises by recognized
authorities.29 Having authoritative statements of the rules collected and organized
as a coherent code simpliﬁes the task.
The rules of evidence fall into three overlapping categories. In the ﬁrst are rules
adapting the principles of proof to the judicial context. In the second are rules
designedtoregulatetheprobativeprocessbyidentifyingimproperprejudicialeffects
that may result from the admission and use of particular kinds of evidence and
requiring that the trial court weigh those effects against the legitimate probative
value of the evidence in the case before it. In the third category are rules that require
the exclusion of evidence without regard to its probative value based upon policies
that override the importance of establishing truth. Some rules do not ﬁt neatly into
just one category; an analysis of their application requires consideration of factors
from two or sometimes all three categories. Nonetheless, the categories provide a
useful starting-point for considering the relationship between analysis of evidence
and the application of the rules of evidence prescribed by law.
1. Rules codifying the principles of proof and regulating their application
in judicial trials
Rules401and402codifytheprinciplesofproof.UnderRule401,evidenceisrelevant
if it has any tendency to make a fact of consequence more probable or less probable
than it would be in the absence of that evidence. There are only two kinds of facts
of consequence in any case – the facts that are deﬁned as material by the applicable
rules of substantive law, and the credibility of evidence once it has been admitted.
Whether an item of evidential data is relevant can only be demonstrated by applying
the principles of logic developed above in Chapter 3. Under Rule 402, all relevant
evidence is admissible, unless it is excluded or its use is limited by the Constitution
of the United States, by statute, or by another of the Federal Rules.
Trials in the United States and other common law systems, especially jury trials,
are designed to be single, continuous events whose beginning point (opening
statements) and end points (closing statements, jury instruction, deliberation, and
verdict or decision) are deﬁned in advance. They are not open-ended inquiries of
the kind undertaken in science and other disciplines. They are closed inquiries in

text, e.g., Roberts and Zuckerman (2004).

Analysis of Evidence
which decision-makers may not have any training or expertise in analyzing evidence
to resolve disputed questions of fact. For that reason, additional rules are necessary
to regulate the admission and use of evidence in that context.
A moderate modern Benthamite or a trained investigator in another discipline
would accept some of these rules as sensible adaptations. They would probably
accept as reasonable the requirement that a witness have personal knowledge of
the matter about which she testiﬁes (Rule 602), that she testify under oath subject
to the penalties for perjury (Rule 603), that a witness expressing an opinion must
demonstrate that she is qualiﬁed by training or experience to express the opinion
and, in the case of experts, that the opinion be based upon reliable principles reliably
applied to reach the proffered conclusion (Rules 701–705).30
Most scientists and historians would also recognize the principle that their inves-
tigations must be limited to some degree by efﬁciency concerns. Resources are ﬁnite,
and a conclusion, however provisional, must be reached at some point. The need for
efﬁciency is greater in the jury trial context and, for that reason, they would prob-
ably recognize that rules adopted to promote efﬁciency must be more stringent
than might be appropriate in other contexts. Rule 102 articulates efﬁciency as one
of potentially conﬂicting goals that should be considered in applying the rules of
evidence. Efﬁciency is one of the grounds used to justify the limits on the kinds of
evidence that may be used to prove relevant character traits imposed by Rules 405
(methods of proving character), 608 (character and conduct of witness), and the
rule authorizing a court to take judicial notice (Rule 201).
The application of these rules usually requires considerable analysis of the par-
ticular evidence to determine whether any of the efﬁciency based rules should be
applied to admit or to exclude or limit the use of that evidence.
Questions
1 Which of the other Federal Rules can be justiﬁed, at least in part, based upon having
as one of their objectives the promotion of efﬁciency?
2 Which of these rules would a scientist or historian recognize as a sensible limitation
on the evidence that may be received in a trial?
3 Rule 403 is based in part on efﬁciency concerns: “Although relevant, evidence may be
excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed . . . by considerations of
undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” What
limits on the judge’s discretion to exclude relevant evidence based upon these
considerations would a scientist or historian suggest that appellate courts adopt and
impose?
30 Three decisions, Daubert v. Merrel Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 578 (1993); General Electric
Co. v. Joiner, 552 U.S. 166 (1997); and Kumho Tire Company, Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137
(1998), have made questions about the admissibility of scientiﬁc or expert evidence a major area
of litigation and scholarship in the United States.

4 Scientists and historians often decline to seek some kinds of evidence based upon the
considerations expressed in the quoted portion of Rule 403. What limits should be
imposed upon the scientist’s or the historian’s exercise of discretion not to seek
additional evidence based upon these grounds, and how should those limits be
enforced?
5 Who has the broadest discretion to exclude evidence based upon the quoted
consideration, with impunity: the trial judge, the scientist, or the historian?
2. Analysis and the rules designed to regulate the probative processes
The prejudicial effects that the Federal Rules were designed to regulate can be
analyzed using a spectrum that has two ends. At one end are limitations based
upon efﬁciency concerns such as those described above. At the other end are kinds
of evidence that can be characterized as having improper prejudicial effects only
becausetheadmission and use of such evidence wouldconﬂictwithpoliciesdeemed
more important than the probative value such evidence might have in establishing
truth. The fact that a city repaired a crack in the sidewalk after a citizen had broken
her leg when it caused her to stumble would be relevant as evidence having a ten-
dency to show the city recognized that the condition was dangerous and that it was a
conditionthatcouldhavebeeneasilyﬁxed.Ifthecitythoughtthatrepairingthecrack
might increase the likelihood that it would be held liable for the citizen’s injuries, it
might leave it unrepaired until the issue had been resolved. We want the city to ﬁx
the dangerous condition as soon as possible. Rule 407 excluding evidence of subse-
quent remedial measures offered to prove negligence, culpable conduct, a defect in
a product or its design, or the need for a warning or construction was adopted to
implement this policy. Rules 408 (excluding evidence of settlement discussions to
prove liability or the amount of damages), 409 (limiting the use of evidence of pay-
ment of medical or similar expenses), 410 (limiting the use of evidence of pleas and
plea discussions), and 411 (limiting the use of evidence of liability insurance) were
all enacted to further similar policy objectives, notwithstanding the probative value
such evidence might have with respect to facts of consequence that are disputed in
a particular case.
Itisimportanttonotethatnoneoftheserulesexcludestheevidenceinallcircum-
stances. For example, a trial judge has discretion to admit evidence of subsequent
remedial measures if the evidence is offered for other purposes such as proving
ownership or control. For that reason, arguments about the admissibility or use of
evidence covered by these rules require that counsel seeking to have such evidence
admitted must be able to analyze and articulate the inferences that demonstrate that
the evidence has probative value for purposes other than the purpose prohibited
by the rule. Similarly, opposing counsel must be able to identify the impermissible
prejudicial effects the rule was enacted to avoid and to construct and articulate
arguments that will persuade the trial judge that the identiﬁed improper prejudi-
cial effects outweigh the legitimate probative value of the evidence. This requires

careful analysis of the particular evidence and of the different inferences it might

law the effects that are improperly prejudicial. But when the question is whether the
improper prejudicial effect outweighs the legitimate probative value of the proffered
evidence, skill in microanalysis and the use of the logical principles provide the tools
necessary to construct persuasive arguments bearing upon that issue.
Exercise
Rule 407 speciﬁes that the evidence of a subsequent remedial measure is not admis-
sible to prove negligence or culpability (an improper prejudicial effect), but it is
admissible to prove ownership or control (a legitimate probative value). Assume
Mr. Smith was injured when his car crashed as a result of a large hole in a graveled
road that connected Farmer Jones’s house to the highway. The next day, Farmer
Jones ﬁlled the hole and put new gravel on the road. Smith sued Jones, and Jones
alleged the road was owned by her neighbor, and thus the neighbor was responsible
for its maintenance and repair. At trial, Smith calls a witness who will testify that she
saw Jones ﬁll the hole and regravel the road on the day after Smith’s accident. Jones
argues that the evidence is inadmissible to prove that he was negligent or culpable.
Smith argues it should be admitted to prove Jones’s ownership and control of the
road.
1 What test should the court apply in deciding whether the improper prejudicial effects
the evidence will have as evidence of Farmer Jones’s negligence and culpability require
that it be excluded notwithstanding its legitimate probative value as evidence that
Jones owned and controlled the road and was responsible for repair? Should the court
require that Jones satisfy it that the improper prejudicial effect outweighs the
legitimate probative value? Substantially outweighs? Is at least equal to the probative
value? Given the congressional policy that led to the enactment of the rule, should the
court require that Smith satisfy it that the probative value outweighs the improper
prejudicial effects? Substantially outweighs? Is at least equal to or greater than the
prejudicial effects?
2 In addressing this issue, is the court deciding a question of law or a question of fact? Is
it applying the rule or using the rule as a guide to the exercise of discretion? If the
court admits the evidence, can that decision be reversed on appeal? What if it excludes
the evidence?
3 As counsel for either of the parties, what other evidence would you ask the trial judge
to consider in deciding whether to admit the witness’s testimony? What additional
evidence might strengthen the argument that the evidence should be excluded? What
additional evidence might strengthen the argument that the evidence should be
admitted? If counsel for one of the parties had looked for, but been unable to ﬁnd,
additional evidence that might affect the balance and had reported her efforts to the

court, should the court consider the unavailability of the evidence? If opposing
counsel admitted he had not even looked for additional evidence relevant to the issue,
what, if any, weight should the court give to this failure?
Rule 403 articulates the general test under which relevant evidence may be
excluded. Evidence may be excluded if the improper prejudicial effects of that evi-
dence substantially outweigh its legitimate probative value. Most of the remaining
rules authorizing the exclusion of relevant evidence, or the imposition of limi-
tations on evidence for the purpose for which such evidence may be used, can
be explained as recurring situations in which judicial experience has shown the
inherent improper prejudicial effects of speciﬁc kinds of evidence by a margin
sufﬁcient to justify the exclusion of that kind of evidence or the imposition of lim-
itations on its use. The problems presented by United States v. Able illustrate these
points.
Rule 404(b) reﬂects a social judgment that evidence that an accused has commit-
ted a crime other than the crime charged will create a substantial risk that the jury
will convict the accused based upon a judgment that she is a bad person deserving
of punishment, notwithstanding any weaknesses in the other evidence offered to
establish guilt of the charged crime. “We try the act, not the actor.” Rule 404(b)
also recognizes, however, that evidence of another crime may also have a legiti-
mate probative value with respect to relevant facts, such as motive or identity. In
such circumstances, the judge has discretion to admit evidence of the other crime,
notwithstanding its improper prejudicial effects.
Evidence that Able used cocaine was relevant to motive, which in turn is relevant
to intent to defraud. Cocaine is an expensive drug, and the decline in Able’s income
substantially exceeded the decline in his expenses. On the other hand, there is a
substantial possibility that at least some jurors would vote to convict Abel (a) for
his cocaine use, or (b) in a belief that it was beyond reasonable doubt that he either
used cocaine or he intended to defraud the government by ﬁling a false tax return
and, thus, deserved to be punished, or (c) because a person who violates the law
by using cocaine is a person who has a propensity to violate the law, and for that
reason Able’s illegal cocaine use increases the likelihood that he illegally ﬁled a false
tax return to an extent that justiﬁes overlooking weaknesses in the other evidence
of guilt offered by the government.
Able also illustrates the role that microanalysis plays in constructing arguments
about the admissibility and use of evidence. In the absence of reliable evidence
concerning the quantity and price of the cocaine Able used, the legitimate pro-
bative value of cocaine use with respect to ﬁnancial motive was diminished, but
the improper prejudicial effects remained great. So too, (a) the number of steps
in the inferential chain necessary to demonstrate the relevance of the fact that the
$25,000 check from the law ﬁrm was cashed in Las Vegas in December to the exis-
tence of a motive to falsify Able’s tax return the following April and (b) the plausible

Questions
1 George Joseph Smith was charged with the murder of Bessie Mundy. The relevance
and legitimate probative value of evidence that two of his other “brides” drowned in
similar circumstances is discussed and charted above. The improper prejudicial effects
are not. Were there any improper prejudicial effects other than the obvious propensity
effects? Assuming Rules 403 and 404(b) had been in effect, construct an argument
demonstrating that the improper prejudicial effects of that evidence outweighed its
legitimate probative value.
2 Smith was not indicted for the other murders. Why not? Consider the following
proposal to amend Rule 404(b) by adding the following as the second sentence of that
rule:
Evidence of another crime shall not be admissible unless the accused has either
(i) pled guilty to or been convicted of that crime or (ii) had been indicted and is
being tried for that crime as part of the case in which such evidence is offered.
Should the proposed amendment be adopted? Why or why not? Justify your
position.
3 When the prosecution seeks to introduce evidence of another crime or bad act, how
much evidence should it have to produce to establish that the other crime or act
occurred and that the accused was responsible for it? Proof beyond reasonable doubt?
Clear and convincing evidence? A preponderance of the evidence? Some evidence? See
United States v. Huddleston, 485 U.S. 681 (1988) for the answer under the Federal
Rules. See Anderson (1999a) for a Wigmorean critique of the answer and the
reasoning used to justify it.
3. Analysis and mandatory exclusionary rules
Evidence obtained in violation of rights guaranteed by the Constitution and evi-
dence discovered as a result of such a violation may not be admitted against the
accused in a criminal trial no matter how strong its probative value may be. This rule
excludes evidence obtained in violation of the fourth amendment’s prohibition of
unreasonable searches and seizures or of the ﬁfth amendment’s privilege against self
incrimination.31 Often such evidence is not only highly probative of the accused’s
guilt, but also evidence without which the case cannot be prosecuted – e.g., without
the 20 kilograms of cocaine found in the accused’s apartment through a search that
was subsequently declared unreasonable, the government could not prosecute the
31 U.S. Const., amends. IV and V.

accused for possession with intent to distribute. The current rationale for the rule
is that exclusion is required to deter police misconduct.32
The application of the constitutional exclusionary rule has always required anal-
ysis of the evidence bearing upon the circumstances in which the challenged evi-
dence was obtained. The party opposing admission of evidence on the ground that
it was unlawfully seized must produce evidence of the circumstances surround-
ing the search and marshal the available inferences to demonstrate that it was
an “unreasonable search.” The Supreme Court has enhanced the need for careful
analysis of the facts (and has diluted the rule) by decisions such as those creat-
ing special rules authorizing the search of an automobile,33 and those establishing
an impeachment exception to the exclusionary rule authorizing the use of unlaw-
fully obtained evidence to impeach the credibility of an accused who takes the
stand.34
The other principal source of rules excluding probative evidence are the rules
establishing privileged communications. Information provided by an accused to
her lawyer about what happened is likely to be highly probative or likely to iden-
tify sources from which dispositive evidence of guilt might be obtained. So too,
statements an accused might make to his physician in order to enable her to treat
her gunshot wounds would almost certainly have probative value in determining
whether she was a participant or an innocent bystander in a bank robbery in which a
number of bank employees and customers had been shot. Society has decided rules
prohibiting the discovery or use of communications between lawyer and client, doc-
tor and patient, priest and penitent are necessary to achieve other important ends,
notwithstanding the limits they impose upon the gathering and use of probative
evidence.Theapplicationoftheserulesalsorequiresanalysisoftheunderlyingfacts.
Did the communication occur during the existence of the privileged relationship?
Did it fall within the scope of that relationship? And so on.
4. A Wigmorean protocol for analyzing problems in the use and
admissibility of evidence under the Federal Rules and its application
Figure 11.2 describes a seven-step protocol for analyzing problems in the use and
admissibility of evidence. That protocol can be used to illustrate the relationship
between analysis of evidence and the rules prescribed by law to regulate the admissi-
bility and use of evidence. The admissibility and use problems presented by hearsay
evidence are among the most interesting and complex problems addressed by the
Federal Rules. We begin with a description of the problems from an analytic per-
spective. We conclude with an application of the protocol to a concrete hearsay
problem.
32 The rationale originally had a second prong. Exclusion was necessary to protect the integrity of
the courts, that is the courts should not be dealing in stolen evidence. The original rationale and
its evolution through the Court’s decision are described in LaFave (2004) §3.1(b).
33 The origin and development of the automobile rules are described in LaFave (2004) §3.7.

a. The hearsay problem35
A rule preferring live testimony rather than hearsay ﬁnds strong support in the
logical principles of proof. In any case in which a statement made by a declarant,
otherwise than while testifying, is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted,
the number of steps in the inferential chain increases and the sources of possible
error multiply. Consider, for example, the testimony of William in a case in which
Sam is accused of murdering John: “I heard Donald say, ‘I saw Sam shoot John.”
In determining whether Donald said, “I saw Sam shoot John,” the decision-maker
must consider William’s credibility and the factors that might affect his veracity,
his objectivity, and his observational sensitivity. In doing so, they must answer four
questions creating at least four possible sources of error. Did William believe he
had heard Sam’s statement at the time at which William testiﬁed? Did William have
any expectations that might have caused him to misinterpret Donald’s statement?
(For example, Donald may have already suspected that it was Sam who murdered
John and, for that reason, he may have thought he heard “Sam” when in fact
Donald actually said, “I saw Pam shoot John.”) Given the lapse of time, did William
accurately remember what he heard John say? Was William’s hearing good and was
he close enough to hear what John said? Figure 11.3 depicts an investigative key-list
35 This section is based upon the more comprehensive account and analysis of the hearsay problem
developed in Schum (1992).

Analysis of Evidence
and chart that an attorney might use to guide her search for evidence upon which
to base her cross-examination of William.
The central distinction between live testimony and hearsay is the availability
of the right to cross-examine the live witness.36 The attorney for Sam can cross-
examine William to ensure that the jury is aware of any factors that might call into
questionWilliam’sveracity,objectivity,orobservationalsensitivity.Shecouldcross-
examine William to eliminate any ambiguities that might be created by his other
testimonial assertions. There is no ambiguity in William’s testimony reporting what
John said and, assuming counsel’s cross-examination did not develop reasons to
question William’s credibility, a jury might infer, but could only infer, that Donald
said, “I saw Sam shoot John.”
Donald’s statement, if admissible, would clearly be offered to prove the truth of
the matter asserted. From the statement the jury would be asked to infer that (a)
Donald saw Sam shoot John and from that inference that (b) Sam shot John and
from that inference, combined with inferences from evidence concerning the cause
of John’s death, that (c) it was Sam who committed the act that caused John’s death.
The logical foundation for a rule excluding hearsay or limiting its use stems
from the fact that the jury will not hear Donald say, “I saw Sam shoot John,” and
Sam’s attorney cannot cross-examine John to ensure that the jury is aware of any
factors that may call into question his credibility attributes that might raise doubts
about his veracity, the objective accuracy of his statement, or his observational
sensitivity.37 Any or all of these factors might have diminished Donald’s credibility,
but the jury must assess his credibility without knowing whether or which of these
factors existed. The sources of doubt about the truth and accuracy of William’s
testimony must be multiplied by the sources of doubt about the truth and accuracy
of Donald’s assertion, sources about which the jury lacks information necessary to
appraise their signiﬁcance. That is the logical problem created by the admission of
hearsay.Analysisoftheevidenceisnecessarytodemonstratethatthenumberofsteps
in the inferential chain necessary to establish relevance diminished the probative
value of the statement and how the inability to present factors that might affect the
jury’s appraisal of the declarant’s credibility creates, at a minimum, a substantial
prejudicial effect that is improper by dramatically increasing the likelihood that the
jury will overvalue or be misled by the assertion.38
Most deﬁned exceptions to the hearsay rule are also grounded in logic. These
exceptions are based upon the view that it is possible to identify circumstances
in which some statements are made that provide intrinsic indicia of reliability
36 Another distinction that is important is that the decision-maker is able to observe the demeanor
and reactions of the witness while she is being examined.
37 Rule806wasadoptedtodiminishthesesourcesofdoubtbypermittingtheopponentoftheevidence
to introduce some extrinsic evidence to attack the credibility of a declarant whose assertion has
been admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule.
38 The United States Supreme Court has decided that the Confrontation Clause, U.S. Const., amend.
VI, prohibits the admission of hearsay testimonial assertions such as William’s report of what John
said, Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).

sufﬁcient to justify their admission, notwithstanding the absence of the declarant.
These exceptions also reﬂect a policy that not only the indicia of reliability, but
also the necessity that the statement be admitted, are to be considered. As the need
increases, the indicia of reliability required are often reduced. For example, the need
for the admission of a dead declarant’s dying declaration concerning the cause of
her death is usually high. Unless someone else was present, there may be no other
evidence. The declarant is unavailable, and the statement, if true, has substantial
probative value. The indicia of reliability, however, are weak. The only apparent
indicia are based upon one or both of two generalizations:
1 People who fear God are unlikely to lie when they believe death is imminent.
2 The imminence of death concentrates the mind and diminishes the capacity to
fabricate.
Neither of these generalizations has been empirically justiﬁed, and both can be
rebutted by a counter-generalization:
3 A person who believes that death is imminent also believes that this is her last chance
to get even or bring down a person she hates.39
A similar analysis could be made of each of the other exceptions under Federal
Rules 803 (Availability of Declarant immaterial) and 804 (Declarant unavailable)
other than the exception for former testimony codiﬁed in Rule 804(b)(1) (where
admissibility is justiﬁed based upon indicia of accuracy and considerations of fair-
ness in light of necessity).
Exercise
Figure 11.4 is a graph on which the need for the admission of hearsay statements
and the intrinsic indicia of reliability can be plotted. The authors have depicted
their view of the need and indicia of reliability for two of the exceptions – Rules 806
(business records) and 804(b)(2) (dying declarations). Review the other exceptions
created by Rules 803 and 804, and use the graph to depict your view of need and
indicia of reliability that might be used to justify the exception.
b. The protocol applied
In United States v. Able (pages 23–28), the government gave Able’s counsel a three-
page memorandum prepared by FBI Agent Dawes stating that he had interviewed
Timothy Cooper in August 2004 and that, among other things, Cooper had told him
that Cooper had merged his accounting practice in July 2004 and that his secretary
had lost or thrown out some materials, such as notes and work papers, contained in
inactive client-ﬁles. According to the memorandum, Cooper told Dawes that Able
39 Even if Mrs. Shepard had believed that death was imminent, she may have stated that Dr. Shepard
had poisoned her in order to bring down her faithless husband so that he would not be able to
marry the mistress with whom he had tormented her. See Shepard v. United States, 290 U.S. 96
(1933), for a full account of her statements and the context in which they were made.

was listed as an inactive client at the time. Dawes’s memorandum reported that
Cooper could not tell from examining the ﬁle whether any materials from Able’s
ﬁle had been discarded.
Dawes’s memorandum also reported that Cooper had no recollection of how the
signing of Able’s return was handled, but Cooper said that he usually mailed two
copies of a return to his clients with an envelope addressed to the Internal Revenue
Service and a note instructing them to review, sign, and mail the completed returns
by April 15. The memorandum reports that Cooper could not ﬁnd a copy of such
a note with the copy of Able’s 2003 return in his ﬁles. Cooper reported that the
ﬁle contains no information about any income other than Able’s salary, and that
Cooper did not recall Able informing him that he had received any other income.
The problem included the following additional facts:
On cross-examination, Cooper testiﬁed that he did not recall seeing Able’s April 11
letter; that had his ofﬁce received it, it would have been in the client-ﬁle he maintained
for Able, and it is not; that his ﬁles were perfectly maintained; that he does not recall
discussing any papers being lost in his 2004 move; and that he has never seen Agent
Dawes’s memorandum and it does not refresh his recollection.

311
Are Agent Dawes’s memorandum and the statement it reports that Cooper made
admissible?
How the protocol set out in Figure 11.2 could be used to develop an answer to
this question is illustrated below.
1 What is the ultimate probandum for the case in which the proffered evidence is
being offered? What are the penultimate probanda?
The ultimate and penultimate probanda in Able were formulated in Chapter 5 (at
page 126). The ultimate probandum was:
1 Richard Able (“RA”) knowingly ﬁled a false federal tax return for the year 2003
(“the 2003 return”) with intent to defraud the government of income tax due and
owing on not less than $45,000.
This was partitioned and repartitioned into seven penultimate probanda.
2 RA knowingly ﬁled a false income tax return for the year 2003.
3 RA ﬁled a tax return for the year 2003.
4 The tax return that RA ﬁled for 2003 was false.
5 RA knew his 2003 tax return was false when he ﬁled it.
6 At the time RA ﬁled his 2003 tax return, he intended to defraud the government of
income tax due and owing on not less than $45,000.
7 RA owed the government taxes on an additional $45,000 at the time he ﬁled his
2003 tax return.
8 RA intended to defraud the government of the taxes due and owing at the time he
ﬁled his 2003 tax return.
2 To what fact of consequence is the proffered evidence relevant? Specify the
necessary inferential steps.
a Cooper’s statements that papers were lost from his inactive client ﬁles when he
moved his ofﬁce and that Able was an inactive client at that time are relevant to
two facts of consequence. First, these statements support an inference that the
April 11 letter might have been lost during the move. That inference supports an
opponent’s explanation that accounts for the fact the letter was not in Cooper’s ﬁle
at the time the FBI approached him. That explanatory proposition is relevant
because it makes the inference that Able’s letter was not delivered to Cooper’s
ofﬁce, an inference that was supported by evidence that the letter was not in
the ﬁle and by Cooper’s assertion that his ﬁles had been perfectly maintained.
For that reason, the explanatory proposition increases the probability that Able’s
letter was delivered to Cooper’s ofﬁce, which in turn makes it more probable that
Able intended to disclose and intended that Cooper include the additional
$45,000 in his tax return and thus makes it less probable that: “2. RA knowingly
ﬁled a false income tax return for the year 2003,” or that: “8. RA intended to
defraud the government of the taxes due and owing at the time he ﬁled his
2003 tax return,” two of the penultimate probanda the government must
prove.
Second, the statements are also relevant to Cooper’s credibility because they are
prior statements that are inconsistent with the testimony he gave on the witness
stand. Since both statements cannot be true, the probability that his testimonial

Analysis of Evidence
assertions are true is diminished. Since the credibility of a witness who has testiﬁed
is also a fact of consequence, both statements are relevant.
b The Dawes memorandum. The assertions made in Dawes’s memorandum are
relevant to show that Cooper in fact made the statements which the memorandum
reported he had made. Because Cooper’s statements are relevant to three facts of
consequence, evidence that he made those statements is also relevant to those facts
of consequence.
3 Is there a rule of evidence that the opponent could invoke to challenge the
admissibility or use of the proffered evidence? If so, specify the rule, and make the
argument, initially in syllogistic form.
Both statements ﬁt squarely into the deﬁnition of hearsay.
a Cooper. Under Rule 801(a) a statement that is an oral assertion made by a
declarant other than while testifying that is offered to prove the truth of the matter
asserted is hearsay. Here Cooper is a declarant who made two assertions to Agent
Dawes during an interview, each of which is being offered to prove the truth of the
matter asserted, i.e., that papers from Cooper’s inactive client ﬁles were lost during
a move in 2003 and that Able was an inactive client at that time. Both statements
are hearsay and hearsay is not admissible under Rule 802.
b The Dawes memorandum. The two relevant written assertions made in the Dawes
memorandum (identiﬁed above) are only relevant if they are offered to prove the
truth of the matter asserted, namely that Cooper made the statements during the
interview that the memorandum reports that he did. Dawes is the declarant and
each of the written assertions that Dawes made prior to trial is being offered to
prove the truth of the matter asserted. Each is hearsay and Rule 802 prohibits their
admission.
4 What, if any, are the arguments that the proponent of the evidence may make to
avoid the application or minimize the effect of the rule or rules? Begin by
challenging the opponent’s rule-based argument.
Rule 802 does not prohibit the admission of any of the statements.
a Cooper: Rule 613(b) authorizes the admission of extrinsic evidence of a prior
inconsistent statement of a witness if the witness has been afforded an opportunity
to explain or deny the existence of the same. The Dawes memorandum is extrinsic
evidence that Cooper made the two prior inconsistent statements. Cooper was
confronted with and afforded an opportunity to deny or explain those statements
when he was cross-examined. The statements are offered to undermine Cooper’s
credibility, not to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and for that purpose, they
are not hearsay. They are relevant, and Rule 402 requires that they be admitted. If
the assertions made by Dawes in the memorandum are admissible then the
assertions attributed to Cooper are also admissible.
b The Dawes memorandum: The assertions made by Dawes in his memorandum
are not hearsay. Under Rule 801(d)(2)(D)(2), a statement offered against a party is
not hearsay if the statement was made by the party’s agent concerning a matter
within the scope of the agency made during the existence of the relationship. The
statement is being offered by the defendant against his party-opponent, the United
States.

At the time he interviewed Cooper, Dawes was an FBI agent employed by the
United States. Conducting and documenting interviews in a criminal investigation
is within the scope of an FBI agent’s employment. Dawes has testiﬁed that he wrote
the memorandum. Any statements made in that memorandum are excluded from
the deﬁnition of hearsay by Rule 801(d)(2)(D)(2).
Moreover, the statements made in the memorandum would in any event be
admissible under Rule 803(5) (recollection recorded). Assuming he followed FBI
procedures, Dawes will testify that he dictated the memorandum immediately after
the interview with Cooper and that he reviewed and corrected the draft no later
than the following day. The substance of the memorandum was made when it was
fresh in his memory and, given his training and the procedures he followed, there
is ample evidence to show that the memorandum reﬂects his knowledge correctly.
Thus the memorandum could in any event be read to the jury, and the jury could
consider the statements Dawes made as evidence of the truth of the matters he
asserted.
5 Unless it is clear (and it rarely is) that the evidence must be excluded under the rule
or rules invoked, what is the legitimate probative value of the proffered evidence?
What are its improper prejudicial effects?
The only legitimate probative value of the statements is the probative value of
Cooper’s inconsistent statements with respect to the credibility of the assertions he
made while testifying. The primary improper prejudicial effect stems from the fact
that the jury is likely to use these statements as evidence of the truth of the matter
asserted, notwithstanding any instructions the court may give telling them that they
are not to consider them for that purpose.
6 What is the strongest argument that can be made to persuade the court that the
improper prejudicial effects (“PE”) substantially outweigh the legitimate probative
value (“PV”)? That is that PE ≫PV? What is the strongest argument the proponent
could make to diminish the PE and enhance the PV in order to persuade the court
that the PE do not substantially outweigh the PV?
a The government. The jury is likely to consider the statements for the truth of the
matter asserted and infer that Able’s letter may have been one of the papers lost.
Apart from the fact that the rules prohibit consideration of Cooper’s assertions for
the truth of the matter they assert, the jury has no foundation upon which to
accurately appraise the value of these statements for three reasons. First, it is likely
that Cooper learned of the alleged loss from his secretary, in which event the jury is
basing its assessment of hearsay within hearsay within hearsay – and so extending
the inferential chain to its breaking point. Second, the support that these
statements provide for an inference that Able’s letter was one of the papers lost is
both weak and ambiguous. The jury will have no evidence indicating the extent of
the problem. If ﬁve pieces of paper were lost during a move of 5,000 ﬁles, the
likelihood that Able’s letter was among them is remote. If the boxes containing the
inactive client ﬁles fell off the truck and the papers in those ﬁles scattered with the
wind, the likelihood that Able’s letter was among the papers lost would be high.
But without any evidence to place the problem in context, it is almost certain the
jury will misvalue this evidence.

Analysis of Evidence
b Able. Cooper’s credibility is central. If the jurors accept his testimony about the
perfection with which he maintained his ﬁles, the likelihood that they will ﬁnd
Able guilty will increase dramatically. If they have evidence before them showing
that he either lied or has a seriously defective memory, they are likely to discredit
all his testimony and the likelihood they would ﬁnd Able guilty will decrease
accordingly. The probative value of this evidence is high. The government’s
cynicism about the ability and willingness of the jurors to follow the instructions
the court gives them is hardly ground for penalizing the defendant. There are no
irremediable improper prejudicial effects and certainly none that could
substantially outweigh the probative value of this evidence.
7 Should the proffered evidence be admitted? If admitted should its use be limited?
Why?
This could well be the ﬁrst question in the protocol. Most lay persons can make a
sound judgment about whether certain evidence should be admitted. Those trained
in analysis have a more developed “common sense” and basis for their “gut feelings.”
But most of the time, most of us would get it right even if we did not know the
intricacies of the rules of evidence and their application. In that context, the answer
here is easy: Yes, the evidence should be admitted.
That conclusion can easily be justiﬁed under the policy upon which the hearsay
rule and its exceptions were based. Given that the source of the information about
Cooper’s statement is an FBI agent, it is almost certain that Cooper made the
assertions attributed to him and that those statements were true. FBI agents do not
reach out to gather evidence that will make the prosecutor’s task more difﬁcult. If they
report evidence that favors the defense, it is almost certain their report is accurate or
understates the evidence. Cooper should not be permitted to lie with impunity and, if
his memory is that bad, the jury should have that information in deciding how much
reliance they may fairly place on any testimony he gives that implicates Able in the
alleged crime. Having made that assessment, defense counsel’s task is to ﬁgure out
how to get in under the rules and the prosecution’s task is to decide whether and how
strongly she wishes to oppose the admission of the evidence.
Exercise
Apply the protocol to determine whether proposition 6 in “An investigation” – “W3
says that he overheard X on Christmas Day say angrily to Y, ‘I shall not forget this’” –
could or should be admissible if X is tried for the murder of Y. Would the trial judge
have to consider the limitations imposed by Crawford v. Washington in resolving
that issue? Why or why not?

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
A. A Wigmorean lawyer prepares for trial
The purpose of this part of the chapter is twofold. First, we want to set Wigmorean
analysis in general and the chart method in particular in the context of trial prepa-
ration and practice in the United States.1 All competent lawyers use and apply the
principles of proof in preparing a case and all use one or more devices to consol-
idate the results of their analysis. The chart method is simply an additional and a
more methodical and rigorous device, one that requires making explicit what might
otherwise be left implicit. Second, we want to describe the processes and devices
lawyers commonly use to translate and reorganize the products of their analysis of
the law and facts into a form suitable for use at trial. We start by describing some
such devices and conclude with a brief discussion of ways in which the products of
analysis are translated into the tools of advocacy.
1. Of charts and other analytic devices
All phases of the trial lawyer’s work involve two fundamental and related processes:
analysis of law and analysis of fact. At all points from the initial interview onward,
the lawyer uses her existing legal knowledge to probe for facts that may be relevant
to the case at hand. These facts in turn suggest further inquiries: the potentially
applicable legal principles may be expanded, narrowed, or reﬁned by research and
analysis. The facts known and the products of the legal research and analysis may
suggest additional lines of factual inquiry. The process is reﬂexive and continuous.
The analytic component of this process continues through closing argument
(and beyond). The evidence is in and closed. Given this ﬁnite body of evidential
data and given the law the trier of fact will apply, how can the evidence be most
effectively organized and marshaled to support the inferences the lawyer advocates
that the trier should accept? In theory, however, the investigative process ends as the
trial begins. The lawyers for each of the parties have a common set of legal principles
to work with – in the jury trial context, the jury instructions. Each of the lawyers
1 We chose the United States for two reasons. First, jury trials are more common in the United States
than in England, especially in civil cases. Second, preparing for a jury trial calls upon all of the
analytic and other skills that this book seeks to develop.

Analysis of Evidence
has a deﬁned and relatively settled body of evidential data. There may be variables
to be resolved: Which of the contending legal principles will be adopted or applied?
Which of the evidential data will be admitted? Which excluded? But in theory, the
available chips are all on the table. And the theory comes close enough to reality to
make the model useful.2
Under this model, a lawyer trained in the chart method of analysis would have
identiﬁed the available evidential propositions; charted the possible inferential rela-
tionships; and prepared a set of strategic charts, each reﬂecting her judgments on
how to maximize the probability that her theory of the case will be accepted and to
minimize the risk that opposing counsel will achieve their objectives.3 Collectively,
the ﬁnal product would be designed to account for all the foreseeable variables.
If these legal principles are accepted, take this road; if that evidence is excluded,
fall back to this position and follow this alternative path. The extent to which real-
ity falls short of the theory merely increases the number of possible variables that
counsel must anticipate and for which she must plan. Although few lawyers fully
chart their cases, all use other devices to facilitate their analysis and organization of
the data. For example, most lawyers analyze and cross-reference the evidential data
each witness can supply. What precise testimonial assertions can this witness make?
To what allegations in the pleadings or to what fact required to be proved under
the jury instructions is each relevant? What other assertions or evidential data exist
to corroborate or discredit such allegations or facts? Are they or can they be made
admissible?
From this witness-by-witness and exhibit-by-exhibit analysis, every lawyer must
develop a composite which she can use to analyze the case as a whole. Where the
dispute involves past events, one of the most useful analytical tools is the master
chronology. Set every event described in the testimonial assertions and documents
in the sequence in which they are alleged to have occurred. Such a chronology makes
two objectives possible. It presents the events in the order in which they supposedly
occurred, the order in which most people think, and thus makes it possible to
construct stories that the evidence supports. It also makes it easier to identify gaps
and conﬂicts in the evidence. Similarly, in a criminal or personal injury suit, the
physical setting where the central events occurred is often critical, and most lawyers
will reconstruct the events through diagrams or models. Both kinds of composites
are nothing more than devices to ﬁx the alleged events in time and space and to
2 In theory, through meticulous investigation and use of discovery mechanisms, both lawyers should
have a ﬁrm idea of the data available for presentation. In fact, the theory can never be fully realized
and sometimes not even approached. Not all facts are ever discovered in civil cases, and legal as well
as practical limitations leave much to be learned during trial on the criminal side. (See discussion
below.)
3 Lawyers rarely use the chart method fully in practice because it requires too much time. Less rarely,
lawyers use the method to chart particular phases of an argument. Lawyers who have been trained
in the chart method, the most rigorous method of analysis, develop skills that are useful in any
method of analysis. Two of the authors have taught law students the chart method of analysis for
more than 20 years, the other for more than ﬁve years. Almost all students have enthusiastically
acknowledged the beneﬁts of the course.

make them concrete. Both are necessary tools for organization and analysis. Both
are common tools. Both are compatible with Wigmore’s general approach.4
The chart, as a method of analysis, does not replace other devices; it simply
provides an additional and rigorous method for analyzing facts and constructing
and testing arguments at any point in the process. The Wigmorean lawyer will
have his or her witness-by-witness proposition lists cross-referenced to each other
and to the pleadings and law; an exhibit-by-exhibit proposition list similarly cross-
referenced; and, where appropriate, a series of diagrams and other composites. One
point merits emphasis: All such devices require application of the principles of
proof.
As ﬁnal preparation for trial begins, every lawyer uses one or more of the com-
pilation devices: A master chronology, a model, a map; an index of the evidential
facts by legal principle and allegation in the pleadings; and so on. Such systems have
long been commonplace among competent trial lawyers. For example, Elihu Root is
reported to have developed a seven-document system in the late nineteenth century
that, with some adaptation, is similar to those in use today. Under the Root-Stimson
system, lawyers assisting in trial preparation were required to prepare seven docu-
ments: (1) a pleadings chart to identify, allegation by allegation, which facts alleged
in the pleadings had been admitted, denied, stipulated, etc., in order to identify
the material facts-in-issue for trial; (2) a master chronology organizing the facts in
chronological order and identifying the witnesses or documents by which each will
be proved; (3) an abstract of the documents to be used, arranged chronologically
or, where appropriate, by subject matter; (4) a preliminary analysis in outline form
that identiﬁed every proposition to be proved at trial and identiﬁed the witnesses
and documents by which each was to be proved; (5) the trial book developed from
these documents; (6) a memorandum of law for the court outlining counsel’s view
of the central facts in issue and controlling law to be applied; and (7) the proposed
jury instructions counsel will ask the court to give. Although developments, such
as the move to notice pleading, the expanded scope of discovery, and the intro-
duction of new technologies, require some modiﬁcation, the description of that
system makes it clear that the basic approaches are timeless. Then to apply the chart
method simply provides the Wigmorean lawyer with an additional device and skills
for rigorously ordering the available data and precisely analyzing their relationships
to the ultimate propositions to be proved.
2. The trial book: an organizational device
None of these devices, however, organizes the available data in a form suitable
for presentation at trial. The ﬁnal pre-trial step must be to reorganize the data
4 Complex cases may require additional or different devices. For example, many cases require expert
analysis and testimony. The data must be collected and organized to facilitate this analysis and
presentation for the speciﬁc case at hand. The point, however, should be clear: All competent
lawyers use appropriate devices to organize the facts at various stages in the preparation of a case
for trial.

Analysis of Evidence
in a manner that will facilitate its use at trial. The most common device used
for this is the lawyer’s “trial book.” The “trial book” is simply a lawyer’s device
for organizing what he or she needs to try a particular lawsuit. Typically, it will
include pleadings, checklists, copies of documents to be introduced and statements
or depositions to be used, outlines for opening and closing, outlines or anticipated
“scripts”fordirectandcross-examinationofwitnesses,juryinstructions,andmem-
oranda of law addressing signiﬁcant problems likely to arise during the particular
trial.
The trial book serves three kinds of functions. First, preparation of the book
is a systematic way to prepare for trial. The lawyer is forced to analyze what she
needs for each segment of the trial from voir dire through closing and verdict. The
lawyer is also forced to organize the materials into a whole. Like the production
book for a play, the trial book enables the participants to see the parts and the
whole and to visualize concretely whether the whole makes sense. Second, during
the trial, the trial book is a ready reference. The trial book has everything the lawyer
needs in one place, organized to facilitate easy use. Finally, also during trial, the
trial book serves as a checklist and an organized vehicle for keeping track of what
has been and what needs to be done. Counsel (counsel’s partner) can check off
that essential questions have been asked, that items of documentary evidence have
been not only identiﬁed but also admitted into evidence. The lawyers can keep
notes on particular witnesses and for reference in closing argument. This section
describes the components typically included in a trial book and the relationships
between each component, the other analytic devices, and the actual phases of the
trial.5
1. The preliminary memorandum: an overview of theory, theme, and strategy. The
lawyer must go into trial with a theory of the case. In this context, the theory of the
case must combine the legal theory, the factual theory, and a strategic theory on
how the evidence and arguments should be presented at trial. In preparing the ﬁnal
chart, the Wigmorean lawyer either knows the legal principles the trier of fact will
apply or has made judgments about those the trier can be persuaded to apply.6 He
or she has identiﬁed the central facts-in-issue, the penultimate probanda that are
in dispute, that must be proved (or challenged). The charts have made it possible
5 The trial book may take many forms: An indexed notebook, a series of folders, or in a complex
case, an entire ﬁle cabinet or several boxes, today, the portable computer into which documents,
deposition transcripts, and other material have been loaded with programs that make it possible to
search and ﬁnd particular items almost instantaneously. Many trial advocacy manuals have sections
that describe the author’s view of how a trial notebook should be organized. See for example Mauet
(2005) 34–37 or Haydock and Sonsteng (1999).
6 This presentation focuses on preparing a case in which the outcome hinges on disputed questions
of fact. Many cases, especially in public law areas, hinge upon how disputed questions of law will
be resolved. Some cases, of course, depend upon the resolution of questions of fact and of law,
which occasionally remain unanswered as the trial begins. The structure of the trial book and its
components vary with the function to be served, but the lines of attack and organization are always
similar to those described here.

to identify the plausible logical theories that appear to offer sound opportunities to
persuade the trier of fact that the ultimate probanda have (or have not) been proven.
The rules of admissibility have been analyzed to determine the evidential data that
is likely to be admitted and how it may be used at trial. This analysis provides the
material from which the lawyer must choose the theory of the case (and perhaps
alternative and fall-back theories) that will be used at trial. The objective must be
to choose the theory most likely to maximize the probability of a successful (and to
minimize the risk of an adverse) outcome for the client.
The lawyer must also know by that time the characters and materials she must
use to present the facts at trial and must have made judgments on the relative
plausibility of the stories that could be developed to make the theories dramatically
coherent and effective. With this background, the lawyer must also decide what
themes can be established and used to develop the available theories and reinforce
the stories. In this context, themes make explicit the concept of persuasive pre-
sentation. Who are the good guys? The bad guys? What ideas need emphasis to
create an impression that will enhance the jury’s willingness to accept the story
chosen?
In preparation for trial, the lawyer must consider and make strategic judgments
in choosing among the available theories, the possible themes, and the plausibility
of the resulting stories as a whole. The lawyer at this stage must choose a theory and
themes that are consistent with each other and that reinforce the desired story and
then must organize the evidence so that it can be presented at trial in a manner that
will make themes and theory come together as a dramatically effective and plausible
story-as-a-whole. The preliminary memorandum is a device to document and test
the choices made and to provide an overview of the parts that follow.
Components of a preliminary memorandum typically include:
a The introduction. A short summary and outline: Who is suing whom for what on what
basis? What does the “whom” want and on what basis? What are the one or two
central facts, the jugular facts, or legal questions upon which the case hinges? How
will these be addressed? How is the memorandum organized?
b The facts. The facts distilled to those essential to the theory and presented to tell the
story and illustrate the chosen themes.7 (The uses of stories and themes are
addressed in Chapters 6 and 10.) The task here requires skills similar to those
necessary for the art of preparing the statement of facts in an appellate brief.8
Typically, these are the intermediate probanda that counsel believes will be
7 Many courts require a pre-trial memorandum designed both to identify and narrow the facts and
legal questions in dispute and to establish the parameters of the evidence to be offered. Because it
is “published” to the court and opposing counsel, the strategic considerations differ; otherwise, its
functions are similar.

Analysis of Evidence
established by testimonial assertions and real evidence admitted at trial, presented
in a narrative form that hopefully compels the conclusion that the ultimate
probandum has been proved or not proved. Each assertion is typically indexed to the
witness(es) or exhibits from which the evidential data will be drawn. The function of
the statement is to provide a touchstone of relevance in planning and conducting the
trial; not a comprehensive regurgitation of the evidence, but also not so abstract a
compilation that neither theory nor theme is clear.
c The law. The summary articulation of the law the lawyer expects the court to apply or
instruct the trier-of-fact to apply to the facts. Here again, the focus is upon the
lawyer’s theory of this case, not simply a persuasive regurgitation of the law for all
possible theories or a summary of the jury instructions. Typically, both parties in their
pleadings have articulated a variety of theories of liability and defense. If pre-trial
preparation has not eliminated or ordered the signiﬁcance of most of those theories,
the lawyer’s job has not been done. Here the lawyer is setting out his or her considered
judgment as to what will constitute the law of this case – the legal assumptions against
which the trial is to be organized and presented.
d Strategy, problems, and solutions. The theory, story, theme, facts, and law have been
organized, not only in light of what the lawyer has to work with, but also in
anticipation of what opposing counsel has and how she can and will use it. Here
counsel presents the major strategic judgments made, the critical challenges
anticipated, the possible solutions identiﬁed, and the fall-back positions selected. For
example, in the prosecution of Archer for the murder of Vern, if the prosecution has
determined that Archer stood to inherit considerable wealth as a result of Vern’s
death, that fact plus the scrap of cloth and the jacket may be the central facts in the
prosecution’s theory and theme. (Review the facts in State v. Archer [III],
pages 142–44.) If the defense counsel has determined that evidence is available to
suggest that Baker believed he had been cheated when Vern broke their partnership or
that Carl thought Vern caused his sister to commit suicide by breaking off the
engagement, those facts plus the Tuesday visit may be central to the defense theory
and theme. The admissibility of the evidence supporting these inferences on either
side may be open to challenge, in which event the entire strategy of each side might
hinge upon how the court will rule on these admissibility questions. Here, counsel
would identify the problems, how each is to be resolved, and, where necessary, what
the best fall-back position would be.
In sum, the preliminary memorandum presents the lawyer’s best judgment on
how the case can and should be presented. Prior to trial, it constitutes his or her
touchstone in organizing the other components of the trial: Is this testimony consis-
tent with the theory, story, and theme? Consistent with the strategy? Is it necessary?
What function does it serve? During the trial, it is the ready reference that enables
the lawyer to revisualize the forest after a day of cutting trees and wandering down
unexpected paths. How do I get back on the main path tomorrow?
2. The trial components. The trial lawyer will have outlines and checklists for
every component of the trial, typically organized in the sequence they will be used.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
321
The following notes describe the kinds of materials that might be included in each
segment of a trial book and how the pre-trial devices might be used in developing
them.
a Jury selection. If the case is tried to a jury in the United States, each lawyer will need a
checklist, charts, and questions to guide him or her in jury selection. The
development of the materials will depend upon the particular jurisdiction’s and
judge’s (i) rules and attitudes about the function and scope of voir dire questioning
and about the lawyer’s role in the process and (ii) procedure for exercising challenges.
Given these, the lawyer must make judgments about the characteristics and
backgrounds of the “best” and “worst” kinds of jurors for the particular case. The
lawyer wants jurors who will understand the theory, respond to the themes, and be
governed by the generalizations upon which both depend. The lawyer’s judgments on
prospective jurors may be guided by scientiﬁc inquiry, past experience, or biases and
“lore” (lawyers’ generalizations). Of course, while the manifest function of voir dire is
to select a jury, it is often used in practice to serve other functions, such as to educate
or establish rapport with the potential jurors.
b Preliminary matters. In almost all complex cases and in some jurisdictions, all
pre-trial motions and other matters are resolved before the trial begins. In some
jurisdictions, counsel may make pre-trial motions and address “housekeeping”
matters – e.g., to invoke the rule excluding witnesses from the courtroom until they
have testiﬁed or to ask how freely may counsel move about the courtroom – before
opening statements. Indeed, where permitted counsel may wish not to disclose her
position on some issues until the last possible moment for strategic reasons. Often,
such motions seek to resolve an evidentiary issue where counsel does not want her
opponent to mention the evidence in opening statement – e.g., motions to exclude
evidence of a prior crime or bad act under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of
Evidence. This section of the trial book would identify the matters to be addressed or
that may be raised by opposing counsel before opening statements and would include
summaries of the arguments to be made and the supporting authorities and, to the
extent possible, opposing authorities counsel may have to address.
c The opening statement. There are many views about the signiﬁcance of an opening
statement and what it should include. But its content is ordinarily a function of two
variables: the central facts (as identiﬁed in the preliminary memorandum) and the
lawyer’s strategy. Rarely would a lawyer include facts not identiﬁed as central to her
theory of the case; often strategy will dictate holding back some of these. The object is
to present the facts necessary to understand the theory of the case and to establish the
central themes to be developed, but it may be necessary to avoid areas where counsel
is uncertain how the trial will develop.9 But ordinarily the opening is where the
foundation for theory and theme are established. Within the limits imposed by
9 At the extreme are those occasional criminal defenses where the nature of the defense depends
largely upon how the prosecution develops its case or where counsel is seeking to keep the defense
cards concealed. There the defense opening may be little more than a peroration calling upon the
jurors to keep open minds and reminding them that the burden is on the government to prove its
case beyond any reasonable doubt and that the defendant need not even take the stand.

Analysis of Evidence
strategic and ethical considerations, the opening statement is also when the lawyer
tells the story and establishes the themes she expects to develop through presentation
of evidential data and to emphasize in closing argument. Its structure and delivery are
functions of these objectives, plus rhetorical and communication considerations. In
addition, the opening statement ordinarily lays out the program and storyline for the
“play” to follow; for example, who will be witnesses and what they will contribute.
The trial book will, at a minimum, include a checklist of points to be covered and an
outline for counsel’s speech.
d The Evidence. The evidence sections of the trial book ordinarily follow the order in
which witnesses and exhibits will (or in which counsel anticipates they will) be called
or used.
i The opening party (plaintiff or prosecution) will typically have for each witness:
a A statement of objectives to be achieved through this witness and a checklist.
(What components of the theory must be established through this witness?
Which evidential assertions on the key-list must be adduced here? How can this
witness contribute to establishing the planned themes?)
b A “script” of proposed questions and anticipated responses or, more likely, an
outline of the testimony to be elicited from each witness, organized to bring out
the central points in a dramatically effective way and structured to place
emphasis on the propositions essential to the theory in a manner that develops
the themes,10 including questions sufﬁcient to establish the necessary
foundation for each exhibit to be introduced through that witness.
c Copies (or abstracts) of any documents or other real evidence to be introduced,
identiﬁed, or used through the witness.
d A set of notes addressing various objections or other points of law likely to arise
with references to cases or other authorities that counsel will use or anticipate
her opponent will use with reference to the folder containing copies of those
cases.
e Copies (or abstracts) of any prior statements or transcripts of depositions that
the witness gave at an earlier time.
ii Opposing counsel’s trial book will contain for each of those witnesses:
a A statement of counter-objectives. (Is the witness to be discredited? Can this
witness be compelled to make assertions that are on the defense key-list or that
will place the testimony on direct in a different context? And so on.)
b A “script” of questions for anticipated cross-examinations or, more likely, a
point outline indicating the lines of questioning that may be developed.
10 Few experienced lawyers “script” the anticipated dialogue. For that reason and because “scripting”
may raise serious ethical concerns, many trial practice teachers do not require it and some do not
permit it. In the context of teaching the art of questioning, however, scripting can be a valuable
exercise for students because the art of direct examination is far more difﬁcult than most young
lawyers perceive. To present a dramatically effective and coherent conversation without using
leading questions while assuring that the proper foundations are laid to establish the competence
of the witness does not come naturally. Anderson and others teaching practice skills have found
that the development of the necessary skills is accelerated if a proposed “script” is actually written
out in advance of the examination and is available for pre- or post-performance critique.

323
c Documents or exhibits that the witness may be called upon to identify or that
may, if permitted, be introduced during cross-examination.
d Law notes for objections, with references to authorities.
e Prior statements or deposition transcripts that may be used to refresh the
witness’s recollection or impeach his or her credibility.
iii For the defense case, the sections of the trial book are the same, but the roles are
reversed. Counsel for the defense are concerned with direct examination of
witnesses and introducing exhibits; counsel for the plaintiff or the government are
concerned with cross examination of witnesses and blocking.
iv The roles again shift for any rebuttal. The notes and copies for planned motions,
stipulations, and other problems are interspersed appropriately.
Interspersed in the witness-by-witness sections, the trial book will ordinarily contain
copies of documents to be admitted and published and facts to be introduced by
stipulation or by judicial notice with appropriate notes on the objectives to be
achieved and the legal problems to be confronted in each instance. Finally, both
sides will have outlines for motions to be made (or anticipated) at the close of
the plaintiff’s or prosecution’s case (or at earlier stages) with supporting
authorities.
e The closing statement. For the trial book, an abstract and a speaking outline: But
here the theory, theme, and law must be interwoven; the plausible story told. Based
upon the evidential propositions established and the lawyer’s assessment of the best
theory and theme now available, the closing argument is developed. The analysis
developed in the Wigmorean chart and developed as the outline for the plausible
story must, at the close of trial, be adjusted (mentally) for surprises that occurred
during the trial. The task is translating the analysis into a persuasive story and
argument.
f Miscellaneous. Every trial book will also contain other materials that may be necessary,
but will not be presented at trial – e.g., (i) a checklist of exhibits with space to record
whether each was identiﬁed, admitted (with or without objection), or rejected (and
on what basis); (ii) a master checklist to keep track of all the evidence to be introduced
or opposed to assure that the essential data have been included; (iii) copies of any
pre-trial papers that may be necessary at trial; (iv) the pleadings or pre-trial order, as
a touchstone for relevance; the admissions, as the basis for introducing facts without
testimony; (v) the objections or other law problems the court ruled upon before
trial; and (vi) the jury instructions tendered (or to be tendered), approved, and
rejected.
3. The trial book: an art form
Master chronologies, diagrams, key-lists, and charts are all devices for organizing
and analyzing the available data. The skills required to prepare each go beyond the
mechanical, beyond the logical analysis; art and judgment are required for each. So
too, the trial book. The trial book should be a central organizational and analytical
device.Itistheﬁnalpre-trialvehiclethroughwhichthelawyerputsthecasetogether.

Analysis of Evidence
During the trial, it constitutes the lawyer’s “bible.” But a trial is more than a mere
presentation of facts and legal principles; judges and juries are neither computers
nor logicians. The trial is an art form.
The dramatic play and the theater provide useful artistic metaphors for the
trial and courtroom. In this metaphor, the trial book is the producer-director’s
masterproductionbook.Thelawyer’srolesareawesome.Sheistheeditor-producer-
director.Thefactsavailabletoeachplayermustbeeditedandorganizedfordramatic
effect as well as logical relevance. The actors must be rehearsed or prepared. The
sequence in which each will appear and in which the story is to unfold must be
planned and determined. The conventions of the “theater” must be analyzed to
determine how to protect and enhance the one play and restrict and limit the
options available to the other. All this must be planned before trial. During the
trial, the lawyers take on additional roles as stage managers and major actors. And
only rarely is there an opportunity to test the production on the road – the ﬁrst
performance is typically the last. Two plays are competing on the same stage for
one audience. One play (deserved or not) will get rave reviews; the other will be
consigned to oblivion.11
The metaphor can be carried too far. The conventions are ethical as well as
legal. The system depends on the players observing established norms of con-
duct whose violation might not be noticed by the judge-critic, but on whose exis-
tence the entire system relies. But even so limited, the metaphor illustrates the art
required in preparing the trial book and presenting the evidence and argument at
trial.
The trial book is central. It identiﬁes the theory, story, and themes to be
developed at trial and the plan for their development. It creates and deﬁnes the
sequence in which witnesses and other evidence will be presented to maximize their
dramatic effect in relation to the theory, story, and themes chosen. But it also estab-
lishesthedetail:planning,sometimesscripting,thedialogue(witnessexamination);
outlining, sometimes scripting, counsel’s soliloquies (opening and closing); iden-
tifying the physical exhibits (a scrap of cloth, a coat, a wheelchair, a map, a model,
etc.); and specifying the manner in which each will be presented and used. The more
complete the book, the less the stage manager has to carry in her head during the
trial.
And it should be clear that during the trial, the lawyer as actor, producer, and
stage manager will have enough to do and is likely to lose the theory and theme and
fail to present the story unless the production book is at hand and is a competent
work of art as well as a complete reﬂection of the mechanics. Logical analysis and
organization are always necessary conditions; never sufﬁcient.
11 The metaphor should not for a moment obscure ethical responsibility of the lawyer. Not only
is the trial a play with real consequences in terms of just and unjust outcomes, but also at every
stage the lawyer must remember that the law and the profession impose obligations intended to
advance the ascertainment of truth. Nonetheless, with that admonition, the dramatic metaphor
is useful.

B. Two simple cases
1. Suggested format
Two mini-trial problems that are the basis of this exercise were developed for use
in the Inns of Court School of Law in London for training would-be barristers.
They take the form of a modiﬁed solicitor’s brief to a barrister. They also represent
compact exercises by which the course-to-date can be put together.
The problems are designed so that, where appropriate, a class can be divided into
two-person law ﬁrms, for example, Law Firms A, B, C, and D. In an eight-person
exercise, the Law Firms would be paired in the following manner. Law Firms B and
D would represent the prosecution (or supply the prosecution witness); Law Firms
A and C would represent the defendant (or supply the defense witness). The trial
pairings would thus be:

Twist
Counsel Firm:

A
Witness Firm:
C
B
The full exercise would have three parts:
1 Each ﬁrm would prepare a complete key-list and chart for the case it is to present.
2 Each ﬁrm would prepare a trial book.12 An entire trial book should be less than ten
typewritten pages doublespaced.
3 Each case would be tried using the following rules:
a Time allowances: (i) opening statements – two minutes each; (ii) direct and
redirect – ﬁve minutes per witness; (iii) cross – three minutes per witness;
(iv) closings – ﬁve minutes each. (The total time consumed by each trial should not
exceed 30 minutes.)
b Division of responsibility: One member of each ﬁrm would open and conduct the
cross-examination of the opposing side’s witness; the other would conduct the
direct and will close.
c The law: The statutes deﬁning the alleged offenses are set out at the end of the two
problems. Students should assume the law governing trafﬁc offenses and
negligence is otherwise the same as that in their jurisdiction. Students outside the
United Kingdom should remember that the law in England requires drivers to
drive in the left lane and that the “near side” is the passenger side on the left, and
the offside is the driver’s side on the right.
The trial can be conducted as a jury trial in the United States or before a
bench of magistrates in England and Wales. The non-participating members of
12 The trial book should contain all those actions necessary to try the assigned case.

Counsel has herewith:
1. Statement of P.C. 21X Heep.
2. Police Plan
The Defendant is charged with (a) driving without due care and attention contrary
to section 3 of the Road Trafﬁc Act of 1972 and (b) failing to comply with a trafﬁc
signal (give way sign) contrary to section 22 of the Road Trafﬁc Act 1972. The
Defendant has the following previous convictions:

Fine £25 Licence endorsed.
Counsel is instructed accordingly.
P.C. 21X Heep will say:13
At 12.05 hours on December 28 last I was standing on the corner of Acacia Drive
South and Sussex Road in North Woodford. Sussex Road is the major road, and
there are “give way” signs 15 yards from the junction of Acacia Drive South and
North and Sussex Road. There are markings on the road surface at the junction.
I saw a Singer Gazelle motor car being driven along Acacia Road North towards
the junction. I estimated its speed to be 30 m.p.h. The driver made no attempt to
slow down until he was about 8 feet from the junction when he appeared to brake
heavily. The vehicle stopped with the front about 8 feet onto the north carriageway
of Sussex Road. A Jaguar motor car travelling east on Sussex Road was forced to
swerve violently to its offside in order to avoid the Singer. I went over to the driver
of the Singer who identiﬁed himself to be Samuel Weller aged 19, of 24 Marine
13 Counsel and the witness should assume that this is a quotation of a statement made and signed
by the Ofﬁcer in his police report.

neighbourhood.” I told him he would be reported with a view to his prosecution for
careless driving and failing to obey a trafﬁc sign. At the time of the incident the sun
was shining, but the road surface was wet from recent rain. Counsel should assume
that this is a statement made by Ofﬁcer Heep.

for the Defendant and endeavour to secure his acquittal, but if he be convicted, to

say:
On Sunday, December 28, last,14 I was driving in my Singer Gazelle motor
car on my way home from Epping where I had stayed the previous night with
friends. At Woodford I lost my way and found myself driving through side roads.
This was about midday. It had been raining but had stopped and the sun had
come out. The roads were wet. At one time I was driving due south – the sun
was low in the sky and was being reﬂected off the road surface so that it was
difﬁcult to see ahead. When I reached the junction of Sussex Road and Acacia
Drive, I did not notice the cross roads ahead – it seemed to me that the road
went straight ahead. I was travelling about 25 m.p.h. When I was about 20 yards
from Sussex Road, I noticed the road and braked heavily. I stopped at the line,
although my bumper may have been over the line. A car went by from my right
at that stage, and swerved. That was an unnecessary action because my car pre-
sented no obstacle or danger. I did not notice the give way sign or the markings
on the road, but I was half blinded by driving into the sun. A police ofﬁcer who
apparently had been standing at the corner, came over and told me I would be
reported for reckless driving. I told him I had been blinded by the dazzle from the
road.
I have two endorsements within the last year:

v.
Oliver Twist
Counsel will ﬁnd herewith:
1. Statement of W.P.C. 213 D. Abbott
2. Sketch Plan of the area
The Defendant is charged that he:
1. On the 8th day of December last in the Petty Sessional Division of Hayes,
Middlesex, on a public road named Yeading Lane at the junction with Boundary
Road did drive a motor vehicle to wit: an Austin 1100 motor car YMP 100A without
due care and attention, contrary to section 3 of the Road Trafﬁc Act 1972.
2. On the 8th day of December last in the Petty Sessional Division of Hayes,
Middlesex, while driving a motor vehicle, to wit, an Austin 1100 motor car YMP
100A, at the junction of Yeading Lane and Boundary Road did fail to comply with
the indication given by a prescribed trafﬁc sign lawfully placed on or near the said
Yeading Lane, contrary to section 22(1)(b) of the Road Trafﬁc Act 1972.
3. On the 8th day of December last in the Petty Sessional Division of Hayes,
Middlesex, drove a motor vehicle, to wit, an Austin 1100 motor car YMP 100A, the
cylinder capacity of which did not exceed 50 cubic centimetres and the rear offside
tyre of the which did not have a tread showing throughout three-quarters of the

Analysis of Evidence
Yeading Lane. At the same time the defendant Oliver Twist was driving his Austin
1100 YMP 100A north along Yeading Lane towards the junction. There is a stop sign
and a double line on Yeading Lane. He failed to stop at the double white line and a
collision took place between the front offside of the Austin and the front nearside of
the police car. There are no other witnesses. Visibility from the centre of the mouth
of Yeading Lane east in the direction of Ealing is 60 yards.
On 8th December, I was driving police car PVR 207E west along Boundary Road,
Hayes in Middlesex on an emergency call. As I approached the junction of Yeading
Lane (which was to my left) an Austin 1100 motor car YMP 100A suddenly drove
into my path. I applied my brakes, skidded and stopped 60 yards from the junction
on the wrong side of the road. Damage to my vehicle was to the front nearside,
with scrape mark along the whole nearside. I returned to the scene of the accident
where 1 saw Oliver Twist (aged 21). He agreed he was the driver of the vehicle which
collided with my car. I cautioned him and he said “I’m sorry. I never saw you.”
Damage to his car was to the front offside. I noticed the rear offside tyre was bald.
Notice of intended prosecution was sent to the Defendant by recorded post on 20th
December. I have since returned to the scene to check the relevant distances.
Twist has 2 previous convictions:

Analysis of Evidence
2. On the 8th day of December last in the Petty Sessional Division of Hayes
Middlesex while driving a motor vehicle to wit an Austin 1100 motor car YMP
100A, at the junction of Yeading Lane and Boundary Road did fail to com-
ply with the indication given by a prescribed trafﬁc sign lawfully placed on or
near the said Yeading Lane, contrary to section 22(1)(b) of the Road Trafﬁc Act
1972.
3. On the 8th day of December last in the Petty Sessional Division of Hayes
Middlesex drove a motor vehicle, to wit an Austin 1100 motor car YMP 100A
the cylinder capacity of which did not exceed 50 cubic centimetres and the rear
offside tyre of which did not have a tread showing throughout three-quarters of the
breadth of the said tread and round the entire circumference of the tyre, contrary
to regulation 98(1)(b) of the Construction and Use regulations 1973 and sections
34, 65 and 40 of the Road Trafﬁc Act 1972.
The Defendant admits driving with a defective tyre but intends to contest the
remaining charges.
Counsel is referred to the Defendant’s statement herewith for full details of what
occurred. Instructing solicitors understand that the visibility from the centre of the
mouth of Yeading Lane east in the direction of Ealing is 60 yards. Counsel is asked
to appear for the Defendant.
Oliver Twist of 203 Uxbridge Road, Ealing, W5 will say:
I am aged 21 and work at the Ace Motors Garage in Ealing as a salesman. It
is essential for my job that I keep my licence. On 8th December I drove along
Yeading Lane to the junction with Boundary Road. I was going home from a party
at the garage. The weather was bad – pouring rain. The sun had set and it was
dark. I stopped at the junction but could not see clearly to my right. The view
was obscured by (a) a large tree and (b) a bend in the road. I began to edge care-
fully out looking both ways. Suddenly a police car came tearing from my right
and hit me. I saw the police car before it hit me and I had stopped. I was half
out in the nearside lane of Boundary Road when the collision occurred. I don’t
remember what the policewoman said, but she was very annoyed and discourte-
ous. She told me she was going to throw the book at me when I tried to explain
what happened. She scrutinised my car and found that the offside rear tyre was
bald.
I admit the tyre is bald. I do not admit I was guilty of any other summonses
and I wish to plead NOT GUILTY to all the others. I did not receive the notice of
intended prosecution until the day after Boxing Day. I do not remember the police
ofﬁcer giving me verbal notice of intended prosecution.
I have two previous convictions for driving offences:
21 December (two years prior to event)
Ealing Magistrates Court. Excess Speed
£10 L.E. (Licence endorsed)
15th July (one year prior to event)
Harrow Magistrates Court. Excess Speed
£25 L.E.

Road Trafﬁc Act 1972
S3. Careless, and Inconsiderate, Driving
If a person drives a motor vehicle on a road without due care and attention, or
without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road, he shall be
guilty of an offence.
S22. Drivers to Comply with Trafﬁc Directions
(1) Where a constable is for the time being engaged in the regulation of trafﬁc in
a road, or where a trafﬁc sign, being a sign of the prescribed size, colour and type,
or of another character authorized by the Secretary of State under the provisions in
that behalf of the Road Trafﬁc Regulation Act of 1967, has been lawfully placed on
or near a road, a person driving or propelling a vehicle who –
(a) neglects or refuses to stop the vehicle or to make it proceed in, or keep to, a
particular line of trafﬁc when directed so to do by the constable in the execution of his
duty, or
(b) fails to comply with the indication given by the sign,
shall be guilty of an offence.
(2) A trafﬁc sign shall not be treated for the purposes of this section as having
been lawfully placed unless either –
(a) the indication given by the sign is an indication of a statutory prohibition,
restriction or requirement, or
(b) it is expressly provided by or under any provision of this Act or of the Road
Trafﬁc Regulation Act of 1967 that this section shall apply to the sign or to signs of a
type of which the sign is one;
and where the indication mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection is of the
general nature only of the prohibition, restriction or requirement to which the sign
relates, a person shall not be convicted of failure to comply with the indication
unless he has failed to comply with the said prohibition, restriction or requirement.
(3) For the purposes of this section a trafﬁc sign placed on or near a road shall
be deemed to be of the prescribed size, colour and type, or of another character
authorized as mentioned in subsection (1) above, and (subject to subsection (2)
above) to have been lawfully so placed, unless the contrary is proved . . .
C. The art of plausible proof: theory, story, and theme revisited
1. Introduction
1. Some questions. What are the central facts in dispute in Weller? Is it possible
to develop a theory which, if accepted, would compel both the conclusion (a) that
Weller was not driving without due care and attention, and the conclusion (b)

Analysis of Evidence
that Weller did not fail to comply with the give way sign? From the standpoint of
counsel for the prosecution, if the court had directed you to proceed on only one
of the charges which would you have chosen? Would counsel for defense have been
pleased by your decision? Are the same disputed facts central to both charges? What
difference would it have made if either the events had occurred on July 28 or they
had occurred in Nairobi, Kenya? These are questions that can be answered only by
analysis. In the context of Weller, the analysis necessary to respond requires creative
analysis, abductive as well as inductive reasoning.
Analysis of the evidence in Twist should have yielded similar questions with one
exception. Presumably, the analysis would not be as dramatically affected had the
events occurred in July or in Nairobi. An analysis of Twist is likely to lead counsel
to focus more attention on evidence that bears upon the credibility of the two
witnesses than was appropriate in Weller. Why? Again these are questions that fall
primarilywithinthedomainofanalysis.Acomparisonbetweenthekindsofanalysis
needed in Twist with that needed in Weller should make it clear that technical skill
and deﬁned protocols provide necessary tools but do not eliminate the need for
creativity and judgment.
Analysis that identiﬁed and yielded answers to questions such as those posed
above should have enabled counsel to deﬁne the plausible theories available for each
side in either case. Those theories in turn may have suggested, but did not dictate,
thewayinwhichtheevidentialdataandargumentscouldbepresentedtodevelopan
effective story consistent with the theory chosen. Does the story that either counsel
in Weller might properly have chosen have as strong or dramatic a plot as the stories
that might appropriately have been developed in Twist? Did you anticipate that the
story presented by counsel for the police was likely to be signiﬁcantly different from
that developed by counsel for Weller? How similar did you expect the competing
stories to be in the trial of Police v. Twist ?
The choice of a theory and a story in the two cases also illustrates the importance
of theme. Does counsel for Weller have to attack the conduct and motives of Ofﬁcer
Heep in any signiﬁcant way? Did the record provide material suggesting that such
an attack could have been successfully mounted? Would the attack have been con-
sistent with a sound defense theory or story? What were the appropriate themes in
Weller? Contrast your responses to these questions with the responses you would
give concerning the themes that counsel for Twist should try to establish in the
cross-examination of Ofﬁcer Abbott and should emphasize in opening and closing
arguments. If you participated in the full exercise, review your own performance
and those of your colleagues in light of your responses. How would you do the job
differently next time?
2. Some notes. The materials that follow illustrate theories and stories that might
have played an important role in famous (or in one instance ﬁctional) trials. For the
most part, these materials are more interesting as literature than prose in presenting
principles of proof and methods of analysis. As you read each, however, ask yourself

how extensive and detailed an analysis of the evidence would have been necessary
to enable a lawyer to select and develop themes and stories for cases in which real
interests of real parties were at stake.
2. More food for thought
a. K. Llewellyn: Who are these men?15
Who are the two men whose names recur, whose lives and honor are the immediate
stake in all this story?
Nicola Sacco, an Italian, resident in Massachusetts from his eighteenth year. A
solid workman, who learned his trade outside of hours, a shoeworker, a “good
cobbler” and “edger.” A simple-hearted devoted husband and father. A lover of
nature – who in prison found difﬁculty writing to his friends unless blue sky heart-
ened and cheered him through the bars. An idealist, bent on improving the lot of
working-men, so strong, so unafraid in his convictions that on trial for his life,
before a jury whom he knew to be prejudiced against such views, he preached his
beliefs, prepared to be a martyr to his faith.
Nicola Sacco (the same Nicola Sacco?), a foreigner discontented with our insti-
tutions, yet content to abide among them. One who forsook all decent views for
Socialism, even for Anarchism. Living and earning here, yet ﬂeeing to Mexico in fear
of being drafted to defend the country. The user of a false name. A man who would
lie lightly to his employer to cover up a morning on leave that he had spent in talk
and not on business. A gun-toter. An agitator. A man too indifferent to American
ways to seek during 12 years of freedom to learn English decently, too stupid to
learn English decently during seven years in jail. An associate of that Vanzetti whom
we know to have been convicted of an attempted holdup in Bridgewater.
Bartolomeo Vanzetti, a man who had forsaken his home in Italy and a good living
with a farmer-family whom he loved, because his conscience would not let him be a
party to exploiting men. A man who, though without wife and children, astonished
his neighbors by his steadiness and effort at his work. A man who, ready to throw
himself into the place of danger in defense of his fellows, was chosen to go up to New
York to discuss the further defense of Salsedo, a radical held incommunicado by
the Federal authorities in their wild deportation drive of 1920; that Salsedo whose
“questioning” is suspected of having driven him to seek relief in suicide. Vanzetti,
a man whom person after person, of judgment, insight, and sensibility, learned to
know after the time of his imprisonment; and whom each of those who learned to
know him came to honor, respect, admire, even love. A man framed up before the
15 Llewellyn (1962) Ch. 20. This was originally prepared as part of an unpublished study of the Sacco-
Vanzetti case. The present portion has been published in Michael and Wechsler (1940) 1085, and
in Joughin and Morgan (1948). The Michael and Wechsler notes [hereinafter designated “Michael
& Wechsler”] have been retained. See Commonwealth v. Sacco, 255 Mass. 369, 151 N.E. 839 (1926),
259 Mass. 128, 156 N.E. 57 (1927), 261 Mass. 12, 158 N.E. 167 (1927). The full record of all the
proceedings has been published as The Sacco-Vanzetti Case (1929). For discussions of the case, see
Frankfurter (1927); Kadane and Schum (1996).

Analysis of Evidence
present trial (on a charge made against Sacco, too, until for Sacco an unshakable
alibi was proved) in order to make easy the conviction in the case in hand.
Bartolomeo Vanzetti (the same Bartolomeo Vanzetti?), a radical leader, a speech-
maker, an anarchistic agitator; closely concerned with that Salsedo who was dan-
gerous enough to induce the Federal authorities to hold him incommunicado till,
seemingly, he confessed his guilt by suicide. A guntoter, Vanzetti, as well. A man
convicted previously of another desperate crime of violence. A man the more dan-
gerous because of his brains and gift of leadership. A draft-dodger. A liar, who
lied copiously and confessedly on his arrest. A believer in violence. An associate,
a sympathizer, a “comrade” of those radicals who threatened and even exercised
outrageous violence in efforts to terrify the authorities into giving him up without
punishment.
Opinions differ, you may observe, about these two. Two things are certain: they
were Italians and radicals; they were accused of murder.
From one angle, it makes no difference which of these two views of these two
Italians you accept. Angel or devil, a man has a claim to a fair trial of his guilt. Angel
or devil, he has a claim to a fair trial, not of his general social desirability, but of his
guilt of the speciﬁc offense charged against him. Such is the letter of our law.
b. Bywaters and Thompson: Who is this woman?
What kind of person is Edith Thompson? She pictures herself as a great romantic
lover, as someone who is prepared to risk anything “for a great big love like ours.”
But she is deceiving herself as she deceived others: just as again and again she lied to
her husband, to her family, to the police, even to her lover, so more often than not
she deluded herself. Consider her ﬁrst as a wife and as a lover: She did not marry
for love; when did she show affection or sympathy or mercy or remorse for her
husband? She refused him companionship, she refused him sex, she refused him
children. She made no effort to make her marriage work or to save it. She valued
her job above her home, above her husband’s life, even above her love for Freddy –
why else did they not elope? And what kind of lover is she? She complains, she nags,
she coaxes, she ﬂatters, she wheedles; she dominates and manipulates this younger
man who is more straightforward and less clever than she is. When she is feeling
insecure she is, on her own admission, prepared to lie to him, to make up stories, to
keep back presents, even to claim that she has tried to kill her husband. She values
money and respectability above her love for Freddy and, when the crunch comes,
she ditches him and puts the blame on him in order to save her skin: she denies her
love. Who’s the loyal pal, the real lover in the end?
No, this idea of a great romantic love is a great delusion. What is the truth?
Edith Thompson is a calculating, manipulative woman who used others – includ-
ing Freddy – for her own ends. She’s a competent business woman, a manager.
She regularly looks to the future, she calculates. Her world is full of plans and
pacts and plots and schemes. Plans for secret assignations, for getting a job abroad,
for persuading Percy to divorce her, for suicide, and even for murder. There are

telegrams and notes and prearranged signals, and, again and again, a desperate,
persistent searching for ways to get rid of Percy without being found out – “when
the time comes we shall need friends,” “we shall need witnesses,” she says; of
course she wants fun, adventure, risk, even love of a sort: so long as it does not
involve sacriﬁce of security, money, or respectability. What kind of great roman-
tic is this who is not prepared to sacriﬁce anything except her husband and her
lover?
Questions
1 For what kind of audience is this intended? What clues are to be found in this passage?
Is it consistently addressed to the same audience?
2 (a) What is the main purpose of the argument? (b) To what speciﬁc probanda is the
passage relevant?

the strength of the support might be increased within this particular framework.
4 Identify elements in the passage that are clearly and unequivocally supported by the
evidence (a) of Edith’s own words (b) by other evidence.
5 Identify elements in the passage that (a) are not supported by any evidence;
(b) involve exaggeration; (c) can be contradicted or explained away or rivaled.

to improve it.
7 Compose an alternative picture of Edith’s character, based on a signiﬁcantly different
theory. Make clear what you have in mind in respect to audience, relevance, and
function; how it strengthens the case as a whole; and how strongly it is supported by
evidence.
8 Analyze this passage and your own in terms of how far there is a tension between logic
and appeals to emotion and how far they mutually sustain each other.
9 In what respects does this passage violate ethical norms or principles of fairness in
argument?

The ﬂat northern Indiana farmland is lifeless now. Only the naked oaks and maples
break the emptiness, their branches standing like skeletons against the foreboding
winter sky. A stubble of dead, farrowed cornstalks sticks through the snow, and there
is no sound except for the wind. But the trees were full and green on that August
afternoon in 1978, and the cornstalks stood high and ready to bear. The land was
alive that day, as alive as the three Ulrich girls.
Donna Ulrich, 18, from Roanoke, Ill., was visiting her cousins Judy and Lynn
Ulrich in Osceola, a little town just outside Elkhart in northern Indiana. The girls
were close – bound by blood, age, and interests. Donna was only a day older than
Judy. Lynn was two years younger. All three were deeply religious, their social

Analysis of Evidence
lives revolving around church and school. That afternoon they were driving over
to Goshen, about 20 miles southeast, to a volleyball practice at the First Baptist
Church.
Judy was driving them in her new yellow Pinto – new to her, that is, for the
Ulrichs were the seventh owners of the 1973 model Ford. Earl Ulrich, a carpenter,
was helping his daughter pay for the used car as a sort of a high school graduation
present. The little car was good on gas, he ﬁgured when deciding to buy it, and it
was made by American workers, by gosh.
The girls left Osceola about 5:45 p.m., chattering about summer jobs and future
plans. Judy was working as a waitress at Farrell’s Ice Cream Parlor over in South
Bend. She aimed to enter a commercial college that fall to study interior design.
Donna was going to do volunteer church work. Lynn, a high school junior, was
working part time as a cashier at the Park and Shop Supermarket in Osceola. All
three were excited about going to South Dakota the next week for a Missionary
Church youth camp.
On the way, they stopped at the Checker Self-Serve gas station in Dunlap,
an unincorporated township, to ﬁll up. Then they headed on, laughing and
talking.
Likely no one knows for sure why the Ulrich girls turned around and headed
back towards home on Highway 33 – the stretch of ﬁve-lane blacktop between
Elkhart and Goshen. There was probably car trouble, for Judy had the Pinto’s red
emergency blinkers ﬂashing and the car was only going between 10 and 17 mph
in the right-hand lane. They might’ve wanted to get off the highway – which was
crowded with vacationers in motor homes – but they couldn’t. Eight-inch curbs
prevented any exit.
Suddenly, bearing down on them was a customized 1972 Chevy van – with a 350
cubic-inch engine, a “Peace Train” logo and mural of a train on the panels, and a
two-by-six wood plank for a bumper.
The Ulrich girls never saw the Chevy van.
Levi Hochstetler was out in the barn, settling in some new brooder chicks, when
he heard the noise. A tool-and-die maker by trade, Hochstetler is a bit of a farmer at
heart and works a lot in the outbuildings behind his rambling white house, which
sits alongside the railroad that runs parallel to Highway 3.
A crash startled him that August afternoon. Then came an explosion. He ran
to the roadside, but the thick black smoke kept him from seeing exactly what had
happened: He ran back to the barn and got a ﬁre extinguisher.
He could see the burning car when he got back. Inside a ring of groundﬁre, a
blackened body lay beside it.
“Help me! Oh, please help me!” pleaded the body that was Judy Ulrich.
Hochstetler saw that her foot was caught between the car door and rocker
panel. He tried to open the burning door but couldn’t. Then there was another
man there, pushing open the door with a stick. Hochstetler pulled the girl out of
the ﬁre.

“Thank you! Thank you!” Judy told him.
Only then did Hochstetler feel the throbbing in his hands. He looked and saw
them covered with second-degree burns. He had heard screams, horrible screams,
earlier, he remembered now. Perhaps they had come from onlookers.
James Fry, a Goshen ﬁreman, arrived with the rescue squad. He looked into the
blackened Pinto and saw a girl, Donna Ulrich, dead in the front seat. Only later
would he ﬁnd out that Lynn Ulrich was also dead in the crushed rear of the burned
car.
Withhispartner,hewenttoaidJudy.In14yearsonthejob,thegrayingpotbellied
ﬁreman had seen a lot of accidents, even people cut in two by a train. But never had
he seen anyone burned as badly as this girl.
An Elkhart ambulance arrived then, and sped off with the injured girl to the
bigger hospital there. But Judy Ulrich had burns over her entire body. She remained
lucid and alert, but her condition worsened. Doctors decided to take her to the burn
center at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Fort Wayne, 75 miles away.
Judy was awake and talking for most of the trip. The medical attendants with her
said she didn’t complain much about pain.
But she asked questions, ones they found hard to answer. “How’re Lynn and
Donna doing? Are they all right?” “Will this keep me from having children?” Then,
ﬁnally, “Am I going to die?”
Tears rolled down a male nurse’s cheeks as he listened to Wanda Lumpkin, the
other nurse, comfort the dying girl by quoting a scripture from the faith they shared.
“When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the
rivers, they shall not overﬂow thee.”
“When thou walkest through the ﬁre, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the
ﬂame kindle upon thee.”
“For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy one of Israel, thy Savior.”
Questions
The excerpt comes from a newspaper story about the criminal prosecution of the
Ford Motor Company for reckless homicide based upon their allegedly having sold
Pintos with knowledge that their gas tanks were likely to explode if the car was struck
in the rear. Consider the excerpt as part of an opening (or a closing) statement in
a wrongful death action by the Ulrichs against the owner and driver of the Chevy
van and the Ford Motor Company.
1 From the standpoint of plaintiff’s counsel: Who are the witnesses and what other
evidence will be necessary to support this statement of the “facts”? Are there any
assertions that appear to be incapable of proof; that is, assertions for which no
evidential data could be offered that would support the assertion as a reasonable
inference? Identify them. Are there any facts of which the court might take or permit
the jury to take judicial notice? Identify them.

Analysis of Evidence
2 From the standpoint of defense counsel: Assuming plaintiff’s counsel begins with the
assertion, “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, here is what I think the evidence will
show (has shown),” are there any valid bases for objecting to this statement or any
parts of it? What parts are objectionable and on what bases?
3 The statement does not include facts suggesting why Ford Motor Company should be
held responsible. Assume that you have experts who will testify, and documents
showing Ford’s engineers knew, that at an additional cost of $25 per unit Ford could
have installed a buffer between the rear bumper and the gas tank that would have
reduced the probability from one in ten to one in 50 that the gas tank would have
exploded from a comparable impact. Assume also that such buffers were known to
federal regulatory authorities, but were not required by applicable standards and were
not generally installed by United States auto manufacturers. Invent additional facts
that seem plausible inferences. In a two-paragraph statement of the facts, using Mr.
Dart’s style, supplement his statement to show the jury why Ford should be held
liable.
4 Assume that Dart’s story (with your two-paragraph addition) was told to the jury by
counsel for the plaintiff as the opening statement. Assume that each of the following
propositions is a statement of law the court will include in the instruction to the jury:
i In order for the manufacturer of an automobile to be liable for the death of
another, the jury must ﬁnd:
a That the automobile or its components were defectively designed,
manufactured, or assembled; and
b That, but for the speciﬁc defect in the design, manufacture, or assembly of the
particular automobile or component the death would not have occurred.
ii In order to ﬁnd that an automobile or a component thereof was defectively
designed, the jury must ﬁnd that the manufacturer knew or should have known at
the time the automobile was assembled:
a That the automobile or component was capable of causing signiﬁcant injury if
improperly designed; and
b That a design for the automobile or component was available and could be
employed at a non-prohibitive cost that would have materially reduced the
probability that an injury would occur or that the consequences from such an
injury would be so severe.
iii In determining whether a design was defective, the jury may consider industry
practices and any federal safety standards applicable in the automobile
manufacturing industry at the time as evidence of the state of the art in such
designs.
a Prepare a key-list and a chart showing the strategic ultimate and penultimate
probanda (i.e., through step 3) that you believe counsel for plaintiff should
attempt to prove.
b Translate your analysis into a brief (preferably one paragraph) statement of the
logical theory plaintiff’s counsel would be applying if he or she adopted your
key-list and chart.
5 Story and theme: Dart’s story is both dramatic and coherent. Identify ﬁve background
generalizations he used or on which his story depends. Identify the characteristics that

two of the principal witnesses would have to demonstrate on the stand (if they were to
be consistent with the characterizations the story has suggested).
6 The defense. Using the same assumptions and assuming in addition that the defense
witnesses will be credible and capable characters: (a) Prepare a key-list and chart of
the strategic ultimate and penultimate probanda you would use for the defense theory.
(b) Translate your analysis into a brief (preferably one paragraph) statement of the
logical theory defense counsel would be using if your analysis were adopted.
7 Story and theme: Prepare a brief opening statement consistent with your theory that
develops the most favorable story and themes that Ford might reasonably attempt to
establish.
8 Assume the trial was to take place primarily in Elkhart, Indiana, mid-size city.
D. Two more complex trial problems
1. Introduction
The two trial problems that follow are based upon problems developed for the
National Trial Competition in the United States in 1981 (Wainwright) and 1982
(Warren). They provide material suitable for a culminating exercise in a course
that focuses upon analysis of evidence for potential trial lawyers. (In the appended
materials, dates should be advanced to make the problems current.)
The suggested exercise has four parts – the preparation of a complete key-list and
chartforoneoftheproblems,thedevelopmentofacompletetrialbookbasedonthat
analysis, the trial of the case so prepared, and the preparation of a post-trial critique.
The following guidelines illustrate how the full exercise could be implemented.
1 Students undertaking the exercise would form two-person law ﬁrms, and each ﬁrm
would choose (or be assigned) to represent one of the parties in one of the problems
and to serve assigned roles as witnesses for one side in the other problem.
2 Each ﬁrm would analyze the evidence in light of the law given in the jury instructions
and develop a complete key-list and chart for the case from the standpoint of lawyers
preparing for trial.
3 Each ﬁrm would prepare a trial book containing all components speciﬁed above at
pages 318–23. The preliminary memorandum should refer to propositions on the
key-list as well as the appropriate portions of the record and should explain the theory
and themes adopted in light of the possibilities identiﬁed by the chart. The “script” for
anticipated direct and cross of each witness should identify the proposition(s) on the
key-list that each testimonial assertion is intended to support (or confound), and each
document or other item of real evidence should be similarly indexed to the key-list.
4 Each ﬁrm would then try its case to a jury composed of other members of the class
under the following rules:
a Witness preparation. Witnesses should know their statements thoroughly and be
familiar with the entire record. Of necessity, each witness will have to make
inferences with respect to relevant facts not adequately speciﬁed in the statements.
Witnesses should attempt, within the bounds of fairness and integrity, to draw

342
Analysis of Evidence
inferences favorable to the theory that counsel for their side of the case are
attempting to develop. In pre-trial preparation, counsel may suggest plausible
inferences by the use of leading questions, but they are bound by the witness’s
responses. On cross-examination, the witness must reveal any instructions
received from counsel in preparation. Opposing counsel may not, however, object
to any testimony on the ground that it is not in the statement or the record.
b Other evidence and law. No real or demonstrative evidence other than that
contained in the problem (or provided by the instructor as a supplement) may be
used. Pre-trial stipulations and rulings and the jury instructions set forth in the
record may not be challenged, although legal arguments may be advanced during
trial to support particular constructions where appropriate.
c Motions. No written motions will be received, and preliminary oral motions will
be looked upon with disfavor. No rights or objections are waived by failure to
present them before the trial commences.
d Division of responsibility. Each side shall call its two designated witnesses during its
case-in-chief. (Only if adequate time remains and the presiding judge is satisﬁed
that the interests of justice will be served thereby, may the other side’s witnesses
thereafter be called as additional and adverse witnesses.) Each member of the ﬁrm
will conduct the direct examination of one of its designated witnesses and the
cross-examination of one of the other side’s designated witnesses. The one
member who conducts the direct or cross-examination is responsible for
responding to and making objections to exhibits and testimony offered through
that witness as appropriate. One member of the ﬁrm shall open; the other shall
close. Each planned motion made during trial, for a directed verdict or the like,
shall be argued only by the member of the ﬁrm who makes it.
e The trial: order and time allotments for proceedings17
i Opening statements. Each side shall give an opening statement that may not
exceed ﬁve minutes.
ii Case-in-chief. Each side shall have an aggregate of not more than 30 minutes,
including time devoted to arguments on motions or objections and to the
introduction and publication of documents and other evidence, to present its
case-in-chief.
iii Cross-examination. Cross-examination of each witness may not exceed ten
minutes, including time devoted to arguments on motions or objections.
iv Rebuttal evidence. Ordinarily, rebuttal evidence will not be permitted. If the
plaintiff or prosecution has time remaining from its case-in-chief and if the
presiding judge concludes that fairness so requires, rebuttal may be permitted.
This should be done only in the exceptional case where the plaintiff’s or the
prosecution’s counsel have been unfairly surprised because evidence has been
offered by the defense that could not reasonably have been anticipated.
17 Based upon one of the authors’ extensive experience in coaching teams for the competition, these
time limits are more than adequate for well-prepared teams. The time allotments speciﬁed in the
National Trial Competition Rules are more generous: ten minutes for opening statements; forty-
ﬁve minutes for each side’s case-in-chief; ﬁfteen minutes for cross-examination of each witness;
plaintiff’s rebuttal, time remaining; and closings, ten minutes for each side.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
343
v Closing. Each side shall give a closing argument that may not exceed ten
minutes. Counsel for the plaintiff or prosecution may reserve up to ﬁve minutes
of that allotment for rebuttal argument.
vi Verdict. The jury should attempt to reach a verdict, and thereafter counsel and
the jury should discuss the case. The nature of this discussion should reﬂect the
fact that the jurors are Wigmoreans.
5 Each ﬁrm should prepare a post-trial memorandum critiquing the analysis and the
theory, story, themes that they developed before trial in view of their effectiveness at
trial and should specify what changes they would make in preparing a similar case in
the future.

/s/ Lucius Coleman
FOREMAN, GRAND JURY
Stipulations
The Government and the Defendant agree and stipulate as follows:
1 The Court has full and complete jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the parties.
For purposes of this Competition, the Territory of Columbia is a location within the
exclusive, special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. No issue
will be raised concerning the applicability of federal law to this case. The subject
incident occurred within the Territory of Columbia.
2 No issue will be raised concerning the sufﬁciency of the indictment.
3 No Speedy Trial Act questions are involved in this case, and none will be considered or
raised.
4 Each witness statement was given under circumstances where the penalty of perjury
would apply.
5 Prior to making any statement, the Defendant was given all appropriate warnings and
was fully advised of his rights.
6 Dr. Joseph Jiminez is the chief medical examiner, duly licensed and qualiﬁed to
determine the cause of death. The doctor, if present, would testify under oath that he
performed an autopsy on the deceased who died as a result of a .44 caliber gunshot
wound to the chest. The bullet entered in the area of the heart, went slightly
downward, straight into the body from front to back, and struck the heart killing the
deceased immediately. Because there was no powder residue on deceased or his
clothes, the gun had to be at least 20′′ from the deceased when it was ﬁred. The
deceased had a blood alcohol content of 0.15 or 1.5 times the 0.10 level at which all
experts and the medical profession agree is the standard recognized level of
intoxication. In other words, anyone who reaches 0.10 will be intoxicated regardless of
their individual tolerance. The deceased was in excellent health. There were no other
wounds. The bullet was recovered from the heart and turned over to Special Agent
Kelso.
Statement of Harold Clark
My name is Harold Clark. I attend the University of Columbia where I am majoring
in management. I am 21 years old and in my third year of college. Last night I picked
up my friend, Carlos Blanca, a foreign student who plans to return to Spain, where
his home is. Also, I picked up Terry “Bull” Dobbs and took him to the Octoberfest.
We all called him “Bull” because he was short and well built. I picked up Terry at
his home. We were good friends. We went to the Beer Garten and had a few beers.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
345
I think I had four or ﬁve. Actually it could have been seven or eight. I took my own
mug. We saw three girls whom we knew and bought them a few beers and were
taking them home to their sorority house. On the way, I told them that I knew of
this eccentric old man that lived at the end of the street. I grew up just a few blocks
away in a much poorer area. The word was this old fellow was about half crazy
and scared to death and kept building fences and stuff to keep people out of his
yard. I thought it would be fun just to drive by and show them where he lived. We
went down Trails End Road and drove around the cul-de-sac. Bull said, “let’s don’t
bother him.” This was after I may have yelled something like “Hey old man, how is
everything in your stockade tonight?” Then we left and took the girls home.
After we took the girls home, I said, “let’s go back there just for fun.” It was about
2:30 a.m. and we really weren’t going to do anything bad. My Spanish friend was
sitting in the right front seat and Bull was seated directly behind me. I was driving.
We drove around the cul-de-sac one or two times. I don’t remember anybody yelling
anything. The old man came out so we stopped in front of the house next door to
see what he would do. He opened the gate and came toward us. He had a ﬂashlight
in his hand and I couldn’t see what else he was holding. It never occurred to me
that he had a gun. However, as he got close to the car he said, “What are you punks
doing here? I may show you young whippersnappers a thing or two.” Bull said,
“He’s got a gun.” I quickly reached over to put the car in ﬁrst gear. The car has a
four-on-the-ﬂoor gearshift. About that time I was hit real hard up side my head. I
heard a loud sound. Somebody yelled “let’s get out of here.” The next thing I knew
I was driving down the street, and Carlos said, “Bull’s been shot and I think he’s
dead.” I guess he was dead. He never moved or said anything. I went straight to the
hospital, which was not too far away, and from there we called the police and told
them what had happened.
I don’t know if the old man meant to shoot and kill Terry or not. I do know that
he hit me plenty hard and I was dazed pretty good while I was driving away. In fact,
there is still a big scar on my head. He must have wanted to hurt me pretty bad by
hitting me so hard. I don’t know why he would do this. None of us really knew him
and we hadn’t done anything but drive down to the end of the street like lots of
other people I know. In fact, we were in my car in the street. We weren’t even on his
property.
I feel real bad about what happened. Bull’s father was a police ofﬁcer and was shot
and killed last year by a robber. Bull worked part time to help support his mother.
He was a straight “A” student and was getting ready to graduate with a music degree.
He never hurt a ﬂy and was the nicest guy I knew. After he drank a few beers that
night, he was as friendly as I have ever seen him. In fact, he didn’t want to go down
to the end of the street either time. Once he said, “let’s just leave the old man alone.”
This is really all I know.

Offense Report of Special Agent Kelso
I was working homicide in the district that includes Trails End Road during the
night shift on October 19, last year. I have been a homicide special agent for ten
years and have worked this area during all that time. I know the neighborhood
very well, and I am familiar with many of the people that live there. At 3:20 a.m.,
while cruising the area, I received a call to go to 10 Trails End Road to question a
Mr. Wainwright, whom I knew, about a shooting. As I got to the door, Mr. Wain-
wright was getting ready to leave his house. I immediately asked him what had
occurred and he told me he accidentally shot his gun when a boy, who was in a car
and who had driven to his house several times that night, went for a weapon. In fact
I said, “A young man is dead, he was shot, do you know anything about this?” He
said, “Yes, I must have done it, my gun went off when I was protecting myself from
the driver who was going for a weapon. I didn’t mean to hurt anybody.”
I later talked to the driver, Harold Clark. I examined his car and his tires matched
perfectly the fresh skid marks in the cul-de-sac as well as the tire tracks in the ditch.
My diagram shows where the car was parked in relation to Mr. Wainwright’s gate.
I took a statement from Mr. Wainwright and what he said about the past shoot-
ings at his house is true. I saw his window and the speaker at his gate after they
were shot out. Also, I know he called the police a lot about cars coming up to his
property.
I found no weapon on any of the boys or in the Pontiac. The Pontiac has a four
speedﬂoorshift.Theboy,Clark,wascoherent,butwalkedalittleunsteadily,smelled
ofbeerandprobablywasintoxicated.Hehadbeendrinking.Mr.Wainwrightturned
over the gun. It was a .44 caliber pistol. The bullet from the autopsy was the same
as the remaining bullets in the gun. There was one empty hull.
Mr. Wainwright’s gun is a “single action” revolver. Ordinarily, to ﬁre it you must
ﬁrst cock the hammer and then pull the trigger. Of course, if you pulled the trigger
back and held it and the hammer was moved back and then fell closed, the gun
would ﬁre. The gun can be ﬁred with the hammer closed, but it takes a terriﬁc blow
to the hammer. I tested it. I am also very familiar with all types of pistols and their
operation. In my opinion, the hammer must have been cocked when the gun ﬁred
and Mr. Wainwright’s ﬁnger must have been inside the trigger guard.
Mr. Wainwright is old. He has never been in any trouble before from his criminal
history. Neither the deceased nor the driver had any criminal record or previous
arrests. The Spanish boy spoke little English and was to return to Spain the next
week. He was ﬁnishing up a thesis for a masters degree in French at the University.

Special Agent L. I. Kelso
Statement of Sally Williams
My name is Sally Williams. I live at 34 Trails End Road. I am a retired school teacher.
I live alone. I am 58 years old.
Last night I was sleeping in my upstairs front bedroom. It was a cool night, but I
had the window open. Some time after midnight I saw a small foreign car come up
to the cul-de-sac and go around the circle very fast. The car returned about thirty
minutes later and did this again. I must have gone back to sleep. Around 2:00 a.m.
I saw a white car come up that looked like a two-door sports model. I think it was
a Pontiac. The car went around the cul-de-sac one time squealing its tires. I heard
one of the male occupants yell, “Hey you old goat, what if we ran through that silly
looking fence?”, or something like that. Something else may have been said. I just
don’t remember. I heard a noise like metal hitting metal.
Then sometime about 3:00 a.m. (I looked at my clock) I saw the same kind of
car come to a stop in the little ditch in my front yard. I just stayed by my front
window and looked out. Then I saw my neighbor, Mr. Wainwright, open the gate
and come toward the car. It looked like he had something in his right hand. I know
he was carrying a ﬂashlight in his left hand because it was turned on. He walked
up to the car and said something to the effect of, “What are you doing here.” One
of the boys said something. I can’t remember what, but he was very belligerent. I
am sure of that. The car was facing outward toward the street, and I couldn’t see
what happened next, but I heard a gun discharge. Then someone said, “Let’s go
quick,” and the car spun a lot of mud and came ﬂying out onto the street. Then
Mr. Wainwright looked around the neighborhood and walked back to his gate. I
don’t know what happened next. I guess I should have called the police, but I did
not know that anybody had been shot. Besides, I have heard shots ﬁred around the
end of the street on several previous occasions.
Mr. Wainwright’s wife used to be a friend of mine, but since she died he sort of
stays to himself. It seems like he is always building a big fence or putting lights out
there or some kind of gadget on his gate. He seems like a nice old man, but he really
doesn’t have much to say. I have never known him to do anything violent or wrong
before and he has got a good reputation for being a peaceable citizen. He doesn’t
like kids or anyone driving around his home at night. He is always complaining
about that.
I also wish people would quit racing around that cul-de-sac late at night. Some-

his home had been ﬁred into once and also where his fence was broken by a car
running over it.
I don’t know any of the boys in the car. I did hear one boy say, “Come on, let’s
go, let’s leave the old geezer alone.” This was when the car was in the ditch maybe
one minute before Mr. Wainwright walked out. This is really all I know, heard, or
saw that night.

Statement of Horace Wainwright
My name is Horace Wainwright. I am a white male, age 73. I live alone at 10 Trails
End Road. My wife died last year, and I am a widower. We bought this house two
years ago because we wanted privacy and by living at the end of this dead end
street in this wooded neighborhood, we thought we could enjoy my ﬁnal years of
retirement in the same general area where we were both raised. Although the overall
neighborhood has deteriorated, our street is nice and well kept.
Soon after we purchased our home, we found that kids and adults liked to drive
their cars at night to the cul-de-sac at our property entrance. They would drive
up and couples would park, kids would relieve themselves, and sometimes the kids
drove all over my yard. They would honk and yell bad things. They made me mad
and I installed a 6′ cyclone fence. After this they would still drive up and honk and
yell obscenities. About a year and a half ago, one guy drove through my fence. Then,
about one year ago, someone ﬁred a riﬂe through the downstairs kitchen window
while we were asleep. I then installed lights in my trees, an automatic gate with a
lock, and a speaker phone at the entrance.
Maybe around Christmas, some kids ﬁred some more shots. My wife had a heart
attack the day after and died in the hospital two months later. Just last August,
someone shot out my speaker phone with a shotgun, and one of my lights was shot
out one month ago.
I have lived in fear and the police have been called many times. In fact, Special
Agent Kelso, who I am giving this statement to, works this area and investigated
most of these shootings.
Tonight, like many weekend nights, it started back again. At 1:00 a.m. a car
drove up and ran into my fence. It was the same car the dead boy was later in. I
ran out and saw that it was a white Pontiac two-door sports car. It bent my fence,
but didn’t break it. The car came back two or three more times and spun its tires
and went around and around the cul-de-sac. The guys yelled obscenities. I heard
them call me a “dirty old s.o.b.” and one said, “We’ll just come over this pissant

fence you old lush.” They left the next to last time around 2:30 a.m. At 3:00 a.m.
they came back and spun the wheels and honked so I got my old long tom .44
pistol called a thumb buster. It’s a single action revolver and the only gun I have.
“Single action” means that ordinarily the hammer must be cocked before you pull
the trigger to ﬁre. I went out to ask them to leave and scare them. I noticed their
car parked in the ditch of my neighbor’s yard, I guess 50′ from my front gate. I
walked up to the car to get the license number. Someone in the car said, “Hey
ﬁnk face, you want to have some fun?” I said, “Get out of here.” My hand was
trembling.
The driver had his hands on the wheel and then he suddenly reached for some-
thing between the seats with his right hand. I thought he grabbed a weapon. I
had a ﬂashlight in my left hand turned on him. The gun was in my right hand.
I don’t think the hammer was cocked. I didn’t want to shoot him so I hit him in
the head with the barrel of the pistol. I guess the gun went off right then. There
were three boys in the car. The passenger in front yelled, “Get out of here, he shot
Bull.”
The car dug out of the ditch and left real fast. I went back to the house. I didn’t
know what to do. Finally about 3:30 a.m., I put on my pants and coat and was going
to drive to the police sub-station and tell them what happened. As I walked to my
car Special Agent Kelso was coming up the walk, so here I am. I don’t think I knew
any of the three men in the car. I do know they came to my house many times that
night.
I have read the above statement and it is true and correct.

Court’s Instructions to the Jury
Members of the Jury:
You have now heard all of the evidence in the case as well as the ﬁnal arguments
of the lawyers for the parties. You, as jurors, are the judges of the facts. But in
determining what actually happened in this case, that is, in reaching your decision
as to the facts, it is your sworn duty to follow the law I am now in the process of
deﬁning for you.
The indictment or formal charge against a Defendant is not evidence of guilt.
Indeed, the Defendant is presumed by the law to be innocent. The law does not
require a Defendant to prove his innocence or produce any evidence at all. The
Government has the burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and
if it fails to do so you must acquit him. But, while the Government’s burden of proof

Analysis of Evidence
is a strict or heavy burden, it is not necessary that the Defendant’s guilt be proved
beyond all possible doubt. It is only required that the Government’s proof exclude
any “reasonable doubt” concerning the Defendant’s guilt.
A“reasonabledoubt”isarealdoubt,baseduponreasonandcommonsense,after
careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence in the case. Proof beyond a
reasonable doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that you would
be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of your
own affairs. If you are convinced that the accused has been proved guilty beyond
reasonable doubt, say so. If you are not convinced, say so.
While you should consider only the evidence in the case, you are permitted
to draw such reasonable inferences from the testimony and exhibits as you feel
are justiﬁed in the light of common experience. In other words, you may make
deductionsandreachconclusionswhichreasonandcommonsenseleadyoutodraw
fromthefactswhichhavebeenestablishedbythetestimonyandevidenceinthecase.
You may also consider either direct or circumstantial evidence. “Direct evidence” is
the testimony of one who asserts actual knowledge of a fact, such as an eyewitness.
“Circumstantial evidence” is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances indicating
eithertheguiltorinnocenceoftheDefendant.Thelawmakesnodistinctionbetween
the weight to be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence. It requires only
that you weigh all of the evidence and be convinced of the Defendant’s guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt before he can be convicted.
It is charged in Count One of the indictment that on or about October 19, last
year, in the Territory of Columbia, the Defendant, Horace Wainwright, with malice
aforethought, and by means of shooting, unlawfully killed Terry Dobbs, in violation
of Title 18, Section 1111 of the United States Code. Section 1111 of Title 18 of the
United States Code declares, in part, that:
“Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.”
Iftheactofkillingisdonewithapremeditatedintentwillfullytotakeahumanlife,
the offense is murder in the ﬁrst degree. If the act is done without such premeditated
intent, the offense is murder in the second degree. You will note that the indict-
ment contains no allegation that the Defendant acted with premeditation. Conse-
quently, the offense charged is that of murder in the second degree. Two essential
elements are required to be proved in order to establish the offense of second-degree
murder:
First, the act or acts of killing a human being unlawfully;
Second, doing such act or acts with malice aforethought.
“Unlawfully” means contrary to law. So, to do an act “unlawfully” means to do
willfully something which is contrary to law and without legal justiﬁcation. An act
is done “willfully,” if it is done voluntarily and intentionally, and with the speciﬁc
intent to do something the law forbids; that is to say, with bad purpose either to
disobey or to disregard the law.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
353
“Malice aforethought” means an intent, at the time of a killing, willfully to take
thelifeofahumanbeing,oranintentwillfullytoactincallousandwantondisregard
of the consequences to human life; but “malice aforethought” does not necessarily
imply any ill will, spite, or hatred towards the individual killed. “Malice,” as the
term is used here, is but another name for a certain state or condition of a person’s
mind or heart. Since no one can look into the heart of another, the only means of
determining whether or not malice existed at the time of a killing is by inference
drawn from the surrounding facts and circumstances, as shown by the evidence in
the case. If it is shown that the Defendant used a deadly weapon in the commission
of a homicide, then you may ﬁnd, from the use of such weapon, in the absence of
mitigating circumstances, the existence of the malice which is an essential element
of the offense. You are not obliged so to ﬁnd, however.
The law permits the jury to ﬁnd the accused guilty of any lesser offense which
is necessarily included in the crime charged in the indictment, whenever such a
course is consistent with the facts found by the jury from the evidence in the case,
and with the law as given in the instructions of the Court. So, if the jury should
unanimously ﬁnd the accused “not guilty” of the crime charged in Count One of
the indictment, then the jury must proceed to determine the guilt or innocence
of the accused as to any lesser offense which is necessarily included in the crime
charged.
The crime of murder in the second degree, which is charged in Count One
of the indictment in this case, necessarily includes the lesser offense of volun-
tary manslaughter. Section 1112(a), Title 18 of the United States Code deﬁnes
manslaughter as follows: “Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being
without malice . . . : Voluntary – Upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.” Two
essential elements are required to be proved in order to establish the offense of
voluntary manslaughter:
First:
The act or acts of killing a human being;
Second:
The doing of such act or acts voluntarily and without legal justiﬁcation
or excuse.
If the jury should unanimously ﬁnd the accused “not guilty” of both the crime of
murderintheseconddegreeandthelesserincludedoffenseofvoluntarymanslaugh-
ter, then the jury must proceed to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused
as to Count Two of the indictment, which charges that he is guilty of involun-
tary manslaughter in that on or about October 19, [last year], in the Territory of
Columbia, the Defendant, Horace Wainwright, while engaged in the commission
of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, to wit, the assault of Harold Clark
by striking Clark’s head with a gun, did, unlawfully shoot and kill Terry Dobbs
with such gun, in violation of Title 18, Section 1112(a) of the United States Code.
Section 1112(a) provides in part: “Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human
being without malice . . . : Involuntary – In the commission of an unlawful act not
amounting to a felony . . . ”

Analysis of Evidence
Two essential elements are required to be proved in order to establish the offense
of involuntary manslaughter charged in Count Two of the indictment.
First:
The act or acts of killing a human being unlawfully;
Second:
Doing such act or acts while engaged in the commission of an unlawful
act not amounting to a felony.
You are instructed that Title 18, Section 113(a)(4) of the United States Code
prescribes punishment for the commission of (1) assault by striking, beating, or
wounding. The punishment prescribed is less than the minimum punishment pre-
scribed for the commission of a felony. Consequently, assault by striking, beating,
or wounding and simple assault are unlawful acts not amounting to a felony within
the meaning of Title 18, Section 1112(a) of the United States Code. If a person
actually strikes a blow while committing an assault, the offense is that of assault by
striking. This offense requires neither a particular degree of severity in the injury
inﬂicted nor the speciﬁc intent to cause serious injury. However, the prosecution
must establish the absence of just cause or excuse for the Defendant’s conduct if
evidence of just cause or excuse is presented.
If the jury should unanimously ﬁnd the accused “not guilty” under Count
Two of the indictment, then the jury must proceed to determine the guilt or
innocence of the accused as to Count Three of the indictment. It is charged in
Count Three of the indictment that on or about October 19, last year, within
the Territory of Columbia, the Defendant, Horace Wainwright, while engaged in
the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, that is confronting
Harold Clark, Terry Dobbs and Carlos Blanca with a gun, without due caution and
circumspection, and through gross negligence, unlawfully shot and killed Terry
Dobbs, in violation of Title 18, Section 1112 of the United States Code. Section
1112(a) also provides: “Manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being
without malice . . . : Involuntary . . . in the commission in an unlawful manner, or
without due caution and circumspection, of a lawful act which might produce
death.”
Threeessentialelementsarerequiredtobeprovedinordertoestablishtheoffense
charged in Count Three of the indictment.
First:
The act or acts of killing a human being unlawfully;
Second:
Doing such act or acts while engaged in the commission of a
lawful act which might produce death, without due caution and
circumspection;
Third:
Actual knowledge of the Defendant that his conduct was a threat to the
lives of others, or knowledge of such circumstances as could
reasonably be said to have made foreseeable to him the peril to
which his acts might subject others.
The term “without due caution and circumspection” is equivalent to the term
“gross negligence.” Gross negligence means more than ordinary simple negligence.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
355
Gross negligence requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a wanton or reckless
disregard for human life.
With regard to all counts of the indictment, you are instructed as follows:
In this case, the Defendant has relied in part upon the defense of self-defense.
If the Defendant was not the aggressor, and had reasonable grounds to believe and
actually did believe that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm
from which he could save himself only by using deadly force against his assailant,
he had the right to employ force, including deadly force in order to defend himself.
By “deadly force” is meant force that is likely to cause death or serious bodily harm.
In order for the Defendant to have been justiﬁed in the use of force or deadly force
in self-defense, he must not have provoked the assault on him or have been the
aggressor. Mere words, without more, do not constitute provocation or aggression.
The circumstances under which he acted must have been such as to produce in
the mind of a reasonably prudent person, similarly situated, the reasonable belief
that the other person was then about to kill him or to do him serious bodily harm.
In addition, the Defendant must have actually believed that he was in imminent
danger of death or serious bodily harm and that deadly force must be used to
repel it.
If evidence of self-defense is present, the Government must prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the Defendant did not act in self-defense. If you ﬁnd that the
Government has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant did
not act in self-defense, you must ﬁnd the Defendant not guilty. In other words, if
you have a reasonable doubt whether or not the Defendant acted in self-defense,
your verdict must be not guilty.
If the Defendant had reasonable grounds to believe and actually did believe that
he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm and that deadly force
was necessary to repel such danger, he would be justiﬁed in using deadly force in
self-defense, even though it may afterwards have turned out that the appearances
were false. If these requirements are met he could use deadly force even though
there was in fact neither purpose on the part of the other person to kill him or do
him serious bodily harm, nor imminent danger that it would be done, nor actual
necessity that deadly force be used in self-defense.
If the Defendant had reasonable grounds to believe and actually did believe that
he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm and that deadly force
was necessary to repel such danger, he was not required to retreat or to consider
whether he could safely retreat. He was entitled to stand his ground and use such
force as was reasonably necessary under the circumstances to save his life or protect
himself from serious bodily harm. However, if the Defendant could have safely
retreated but did not do so, his failure to retreat is a circumstance which you may
consider, together with all other circumstances, in determining whether he went
farther in repelling the danger, real or apparent, than he was justiﬁed in doing under
the circumstances.

356
Analysis of Evidence
Even if the other person was the aggressor and the Defendant was justiﬁed in
using force in self-defense, he would not be entitled to use any greater force than he
had reasonable grounds to believe and actually did believe to be necessary under the
circumstances to save his life or avert serious bodily harm. In determining whether
the Defendant used excessive force in defending himself, you may consider all the
circumstances under which he acted. The claim of self-defense is not necessarily
defeated if greater force than would have seemed necessary in cold blood was used
by the Defendant in the heat of passion generated by an assault upon him. A
belief which may be unreasonable in cold blood may be actually and reasonably
entertained in the heat of passion.
In this case, the Defendant has also relied in part upon the defense of accident.
If evidence of accident is present, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the discharge of the Defendant’s gun was not accidental. If you believe
that the Defendant, while engaged in the commission of a lawful act and while using
due caution and circumspection, accidentally discharged the gun which caused the
death of Terry Dobbs, or if you have a reasonable doubt thereof, then you should
ﬁnd the Defendant “not guilty” on all counts of the indictment.
Any verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror. In order to
return a verdict, it is necessary that each juror agree thereto. In other words, your
verdict must be unanimous. It is your duty as jurors to consult with one another,
and to deliberate in an effort to reach agreement if you can do so without violence
to individual judgment. Each of you must decide the case for yourself, but only after
an impartial consideration of the evidence in the case with your fellow jurors. In
the course of your deliberations, do not hesitate to re-examine your own view and
change your opinion if convinced it is erroneous. But do not surrender your honest
conviction as to the weight or effect of the evidence solely because of the opinion
of your fellow jurors, or for the mere purpose of returning a verdict.

Dale Warren, Jr., and in support of such Contest would respectfully show to this
Honorable Court and jury the following:
1 This Contest is brought as an ancillary proceeding to the Application for Probate of a
purported holographic Will of James Dale Warren, Deceased, dated October 31, last
year, ﬁled by the Decedent’s son, James Dale Warren, Jr., in Cause No. 10-05-XX,
pending, on November 4, last year.
2 By order of the Court, it has been adjudged and decreed that the purported Will dated
October 31, last year, bears the signature of James Dale Warren, Deceased, and satisﬁes
the formalities of the laws of the State of Nocona for the making of a legally binding
holographic will. By further Order of the Court, it has been adjudged and decreed
that the parties to this proceeding, Susan Warren Gearhart, Contestant, and James
Dale Warren, Jr., Proponent, are the sole legal heirs of James Dale Warren, Deceased,
and as such, the parties have proper standing and interest for this proceeding.
3 As grounds for her Contest of Will, Contestant would show to this Honorable Court
and jury that the purported October 31, last year Will of her father, James Dale
Warren, Deceased, was executed at a time and under such circumstances when he was
not of sound mind and did not possess sufﬁcient capacity to make a will. Because the
decedent lacked testamentary capacity, as that term is deﬁned by law, at the time of his
execution of the purported October 31, last year Will, said document is not the valid
Will of James Dale Warren, Deceased, and is therefore null and void.
4 As additional and/or alternative grounds for her Contest of Will, your Contestant
would show this Honorable Court and Jury that the purported October 31, last year
Will of her father, James Dale Warren, Deceased, was executed at a time and under
such circumstances that James Dale Warren, Jr. exercised over the decedent and over
the mind and will of the decedent such inﬂuence or dominion as prevented the
alleged Will from being the decedent’s own free will and constituted it instead the will
of the Proponent. Because the decedent executed the purported October 31, last year
Will under the proponent’s undue inﬂuence, as that term is deﬁned by law, said
document is not the valid Will of James Dale Warren, Deceased, and is therefore null
and void.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, by reason of the above and forego-
ing, your Contestant must generally deny the allegations in support of probate
offered by Proponent’s Application for Probate, and Contestant prays that the
purported October 31, last year Will of James Dale Warren, Deceased, be denied
admission to probate and be declared null and void on the grounds of lack of tes-
tamentary capacity and/or undue inﬂuence with respect to the execution thereof,
and Contestant prays further that she be given such other relief, at law or in equity,
to which she may be entitled and for which she will ever pray.
Respectfully submitted,

Attorney for Contestant, Susan Warren Gearhart

Answer to Petition for Contest of Will
NOW COMES James Dale Warren, Jr., acting as Defendant and Proponent herein,
and ﬁles this Answer to the Petition for Contest of Will and would respectfully show
the Court and jury the following:
1 Paragraph 1 is admitted.
2 Paragraph 2 is admitted.
3 Paragraphs 3 and 4 are denied, and your Proponent would show that there is no legal
or factual basis upon which the Last Will and Testament of James Dale Warren,
Deceased, dated October 31, last year, should be declared null and void or denied
admission to probate.
WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Proponent/Defendant prays that
the Original Petition for Contest of Will be denied and that this Court enter judg-
ment for Proponent in accordance with the facts and law and for such other and
further relief to which he may be entitled.

Dear Son,
Thanks for your phone call last night. It meant a lot to me to hear from you and

you were growing up. Your half sister, Susan, has remarried recently, to a guy named
Bill Gearhart. He is a stockbroker, not very successful, but enough to take care of Susan
and the kids. I have been here in this Home since April, and I don’t mind it too much,
except I really miss watching Kim and James grow up. I love them like they were my
own.
I have thought about your problem of needing a grub-stake to produce your new
play. I have decided to ﬁnd a way to help you. It would really make me feel wonderful
if I could help you do something great in your life.
I really look forward to your next phone call and especially to your promised visit
in the near future.

Analysis of Evidence
Statement of Susan Gearhart
My name is Susan Warren Gearhart. I live at 4250 Riverside Lane, Happy Valley,
Nocona. I am thirty-nine years old. My father was James Dale Warren, and my
mother was Mary Warren, who is now deceased. I have a half-brother named Jim
from my father’s ﬁrst marriage to Elizabeth Warren, who, as far as I know, is dead.
My father and Elizabeth Warren were divorced when my half-brother was about
two years old.
Ten years ago on July 4, last year, I married Bill Gearhart. Bill is my second
husband, and my ﬁrst husband’s name was Tom Smith. By Tom Smith, I had a son,
James Warren Smith, who is now twelve years old, and a daughter, Mary Kimberly
Smith, who is now ten years old. When Tom and I married, we continued living in
my father’s home with him, since my mother had recently passed away, and I didn’t
want to leave my father all alone. Tom was a salesman, and he was on the road a lot,
so it worked out well for me to live at home and have Dad there to help raise the
kids when they came along. About a year after Kim was born, Tom Smith divorced
me, and I continued to live there with my father in our family home on Riverside
Lane. Actually, I have never lived anywhere other than on Riverside Lane, except for
the times when I was away at school.
My dad’s health began to fail long ago, and I never felt comfortable leaving him
alone in the house for the last four or ﬁve years. I had discussed moving out of the
house with him, but he was very opposed to it, especially since he enjoyed having
Jamie, his namesake grandson, and Kim there with him. He was a very devoted
grandparent, and my children were extremely devoted to him. I know he would
never have failed to include me and my children in his will, if he were in his right
mind.
When I was growing up here in Happy Valley, I had an almost perfect rela-
tionship with my parents, and they had a wonderful relationship with each other.
My father told me that he and Elizabeth had gotten a divorce because he couldn’t
stand her constant bad temper, complaints and nagging. He never spoke kindly
of her. As for my half-brother, Jim, my dad told me he had been sending child
support for the ﬁrst twenty years of Jim’s life and had never gotten a thank you
for anything from Jim or Elizabeth. It seemed to hurt him that Jim never wrote
to thank him for the presents my father used to send him. He was a very ungrate-
ful boy. I can remember that he used to telephone our house back when he was
in high school, and he would always be rude to me and my mother. He would
say something like, “Let me speak to the old man.” Sometimes my dad would
be in when Jim would call, and my dad would always get really upset after their
conversations. My dad always said that each telephone call was for the purpose
of asking for money to buy something extravagant, like a car or a travel ticket.
When I was just about right out of high school, Jim decided to come to Happy
Valley, probably to try to borrow money again. By then, my mother was very ill
and suffering from a nervous condition caused by her medication, and I prayed

Jim would not show up to upset our household. I warned Mother in advance that
he might possibly show up, because I thought it might be harmful to her to be
surprised by his visit. Sure enough when he showed up, he was something of a
surprise.
When Jim arrived at the front door, he was wearing ﬁlthy rags and had a long
beard and long hair. I reluctantly let him in after he told me who he was, and I
took him into my father’s study and introduced my dad to Jim. I think they had
met a few times over the years, but I doubt that he could have recognized Jim as
his own son on that day. I then left the room, and the only thing I heard about
their conversation was when I walked by and heard Jim saying things about how
tough it was to be a poor student and that he would appreciate any help my father
might give him. My father then announced a principle that I had often heard him
say, and that was, “A man ought to make it on his own, or not at all.” The rest of
what I heard were just a few mumblings which sounded kind of like an argument
to me. I don’t recall how long Jim was there. When Jim left my father’s study, he
walked out into the hall and asked me if I would give him a ride. As I headed for
my coat, he asked me also to see if I could pick up some money for him to use
or else he just might have to stay around a few days. I then went upstairs and got
some money I had been given as a present. When we got in the car, Jim asked
me again for some money, and I gave it to him and told him that he should use
it to leave town and that he should not come back to upset my family any more.
I should have listened to him at the time, because he laughed at me and told
me that he would be back and that he would get whatever he wanted out of the
old man.
Over the next several years, Jim never called one time that I know of to speak
with my dad, and he never wrote any letters that I saw, either. I don’t think he ever
came to visit, because I certainly didn’t see him. I have heard from other people
that Jim turned out to be a drug addict, and I think he was on drugs the day he
came to see my dad way back there, or at least he looked like it. My dad never talked
about him or Elizabeth to me after that visit, and we continued to have a good life
together, until my dear mother died when I was about twenty-three years old. Two
years later, I married Tom Smith, and he moved into my house, so I could continue
to take care of my dad.
Several years after my divorce, I met Bill Gearhart, and we were engaged for over
a year before we ﬁnally married. My dad was aware that I was going to marry Bill,
but he never really said very much about it to me. I don’t think he liked Bill, but
then he never thought anyone was good enough for his daughter – just a typical
father. The only comment he ever made to me was after Bill and I got married,
he seemed a little surprised that Bill would be willing to live in another man’s
home, in the same house where I had been married and living with Tom Smith,
and he repeated his old philosophy that a man should succeed on his own or not
at all.

Analysis of Evidence
On many occasions, my father used to tell me that it was his intention to leave the
home on River Lane to me so that I could raise Jamie and Kim properly. The home
is worth probably $250,000 in today’s market in Happy Valley. He also told me he
wanted me to have everything else of his in return for the years I had spent taking
care of him. We had a wonderful relationship, and it certainly came as no surprise
to me that I would be his sole beneﬁciary in his will. On May 26, last year, I was
with him when he sat down and wrote out a will leaving the house and everything
to me.
My dad’s health had gotten to be really poor, and it seemed to me that he would
be much better off where nursing care would be available in the event anything
serious happened. The doctors told me he had all sorts of problems which could at
any moment result in an emergency, which is, of course, what ﬁnally did happen to
him when he had the stroke. After Bill and I married, sometimes he would go with
me to the nursing home to visit my dad, but of course Dad paid the most attention
to Jamie and Kim when we visited. I was there practically every day, and I felt he
was really happy there, or I would have taken him back home with me. My dad
had a roommate named Ernie Potter, whom he seemed to like quite a bit, although
Mr. Potter always seemed to be ﬂaky and sour-acting when I saw him. Certainly my
father never objected to me about staying at the nursing home instead of living in
his home with me and the kids.
Sometime in the middle of the summer, my half-brother called to tell me he
wanted to speak with my dad. I can’t really recall when it was, it could have been
anytime during the summer months. I told him where Dad was and gave him the
address where he could write to him. I know he later called my husband one day
while I was visiting with my dad and asked for the information again, telling Bill
that he had lost it. Bill gave him the phone number and address where my dad could
be reached. So far as I know, he never bothered to call or write, at least my dad never
mentioned it if he did.
On October 28, last year, I received a phone call from the Happy Valley Nursing
Home just as I ﬁnished feeding old Cassie. At that time, I learned that my dad
had suffered a stroke, which they believed to be a mild stroke, and that they were
going to put him in the hospital wing for treatment and observation. I rushed
on down to the hospital and stayed with him all of the time that they permitted
me to during that day. He really wasn’t quite right on that day, and he didn’t act
like himself at all. He was having a terrible time talking and he was weepy and
depressed. I was very worried about him, but the nurses kept telling me he was
doing very well. I was never able to talk with the doctors before I left to go home that
night.
On the next morning, I was on my way to the hospital to see my dad and spend
the day with him, when I was involved in a terrible car accident. The guy ran a stop
sign and hit me broadside. I hit my nose on something and broke it, which gave
me two black eyes later on. It also caused me to cut my lip and my forehead, and
I really looked horrible. Also, I broke several ribs and could barely breathe. I was

taken to Valley Hospital in an ambulance, where I was admitted for treatment of my
injuries. I called Bill at work and told him about it and told him to call the hospital
to advise them that I would not be there because of my injuries. I also told Bill that
he should instruct the nurses and doctors not to mention my injuries to my dad,
because it would upset him under the circumstances. When Bill got to the hospital
to see me, he had already called the Happy Valley Hospital and had told them of
my situation. Bill also told me that the nurses said not to worry about Mr. Warren,
because he was in very good condition. At some point in time, Bill went over to the
Happy Valley Hospital to check up on my dad, and he told me my dad had been
sleeping peacefully when he saw him.
On October 30, 1 called my dad’s room twice, hoping to speak with him. I had
decided that maybe I would tell him I had caught a cold or something and that I
would not be able to visit with him because it might be contagious. A man answered
the phone and told me that Mr. Warren was doing very well, but that he could not
talk on the telephone because of doctor’s orders and that Mr. Warren couldn’t really
speak very well anyway. I asked the man to tell my dad that I had called and that
I would call him back. I also asked the man to give my dad best wishes from his
grandchildren. The man did not tell me his name, I am certain, and I did not ﬁnd
out until later that it was probably my half-brother, Jim. By October 31, my face
was really black and blue, and I looked absolutely frightening. I again concluded
I simply could not possibly go to visit my dad in that condition. I was discharged
from the hospital during the afternoon of October 31, and stayed at home. Again, I
called my dad’s room and was told by the same male voice just about the same story,
and now I believe that it was my half-brother, Jim, to whom I spoke. I also called
the nurses’ station and spoke with a nurse by the name of Pat Duffey, with whom I
had been casually acquainted back in high school. She had heard about my accident
and asked me how I was doing. I explained to her that I had been discharged from
the hospital, but that I looked too awful to come to visit my dad. She reassured
me that my dad appeared to be in pretty stable condition. She suggested that 1
should put on some makeup and come in to visit my dad whenever I felt like I
could, because she explained that it had been her experience that stroke patients
could not be considered really stable for a few weeks after an initial problem. I
believe that telephone call was between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. in the afternoon of
October 31, [last year].
Around 11:30 that evening, Pat Duffey called me to tell me that my dad had taken
a terrible turn for the worse and that his condition had resulted in his receiving
a great deal of emergency care and attention, but to no avail. She told me my
dad had passed away. She also told me that my brother was there and would be
able to take care of all of the arrangements and details and for me not to worry
about coming to the hospital that night if I didn’t feel able. I was shocked to learn
of my brother’s presence, and told her that I did not have any idea that he had
been there at all. Pat Duffey told me she was surprised that I did not know of it
and had assumed that I had known that he had been there constantly for three

My Commission Expires at Death.
Statement of Pat Duffey, R.N.
My name is Pat Duffey. I live alone at 3737 South Street, Happy Valley, Nocona.
I am thirty-seven years old, and I have been employed as a primary care nurse in
the Happy Valley Nursing Home Hospital since I obtained my M.S.N. at Nocona
University. I am occasionally assigned to be the nurse on duty in the nursing home
wing of Happy Valley Nursing Home, but usually my duties involve only the hos-
pital wing. I have known James Warren since April 15, when he moved to the
Home.
On the 27th through the 31st of October of last year, I covered the morning shifts
for a nurse who was ill who was assigned to the Home wing. My regular shift at the
hospital was the 3-11 shift, which I also worked that week.
On the morning of the 28th of October, James Warren had a mild stroke in
his room at Happy Valley Nursing Home, and he was immediately moved to the
hospital wing for special care for his condition. That evening, I checked on him and
found his daughter, Susan, with him. He was in stable condition, physically, but he
was mentally slightly disoriented, which is typical of the stroke patients which I have
attended. He was being medicated to keep him calm to avoid his being excessively
frustrated by his confusion. I observed him become somewhat depressed about his
inability to speak properly at times. He was sort of childlike in his dependency on
his daughter. For example, he began to cry when she tried to go home, and she had
to stay until he went to sleep.
Next morning I received a call on duty at the Home, and it was Bill Gearhart
telling me about Susan’s accident. Shortly thereafter, I met Jim Warren and told
him about the accident. I told him to please not mention it to James Warren, and
he assured me that he had no intention of bringing up Susan or her accident to
Mr. Warren.
On October 30 and 31, I saw Jim Warren in his father’s room throughout my
entire 3–11 shifts. I noticed on the 30th of October that he had shaved off the beard
and mustache which he had on the ﬁrst day, and I also noticed that he was wearing

new clothes. He had brought in several ﬂower arrangements and other gifts for his
father. I assumed he was very devoted to his father, because each time I would go
into the room, on the 30th of October, Jim would be sitting on the side of the bed, or
standing at the side of the bed, telling his father details about his being a playwright
and some of the stories he had written. On the 30th, Mr. Warren seemed to improve
quite a bit in his speaking ability, and once during my shift, he asked me quite plainly
to ﬁnd out why Susan had not come to see him since his stroke. I realized that he
was still a little disoriented and confused when he made that comment, but at least
his speech was getting better.
On the 31st of October, I checked on Mr. Warren immediately after beginning
my 3–11 shift. Jim Warren was still in his father’s room talking to him constantly.
When I walked into the room around 3:30, I saw that Mr. Warren was holding a pen
in his hand and a blank sheet of paper was in front of him. I assumed he couldn’t
speak well and that he was going to try to write things he wanted to say. I took
Mr. Warren’s blood pressure and had to remove the pen from his hand. At that time,
Mr. Warren was able to say a few words which were reasonably well articulated, and
I don’t recall him saying anything that didn’t make sense or anything like that. I
remember only that he stated that he was very tired when I asked him how he was
feeling.
As I left the room, I saw Mr. Warren motion to his son, and Jim Warren got up
and put the pen back into his father’s hand and started talking to him again.
At the nurses’ station, while one of the nurses was complaining about all of the
drugs missing lately, I answered a call from Susan Gearhart inquiring as to her
father’s condition. I tried to be reassuring to her in order not to worry her too
much, just in case her injuries were still severe. However, I felt uneasy about her
father’s condition and encouraged her to attempt to come to the hospital to visit
him if she felt she could. I feel terrible about not having mentioned to her at that
time that Jim Warren was there, but I really didn’t know the relationship between
the two. I’m sure if I had mentioned that he was there, this whole thing wouldn’t
have happened to her.
Each time I went back to see Mr. Warren for the remainder of my shift until
about 7:00, he was asleep, or at least appeared to be, except for once when I looked
in and saw him writing on a piece of paper with Jim standing beside him helping
him to write. I couldn’t say whether Jim could have read the words on the paper
from his position or not, and I think I observed that occurrence shortly before we
served dinner, although I really can’t say for sure when it was.
Around 7:30 p.m., Jim Warren came running out to the nurses’ station and said
his father appeared to be getting very weak and was having difﬁculty breathing.
He was really panic-stricken. From that point on, James Warren’s condition went
steadily downhill, and nothing we did seemed to do any good. Jim Warren stayed in
the room until we ordered him to leave, because he was extremely emotionally upset
and kept saying, “Please, Dad, not now, Dad,” and things to that effect. The doctor

walked out to tell Jim Warren of his father’s death, and I went to the telephone to
advise Susan Gearhart. It was at the time of that ﬁrst telephone conversation that I
ﬁrst mentioned Jim Warren’s presence to her and learned she had known nothing
of his being in town.
I stood there and observed the doctor as he ﬁlled out the attached clinical
summary. It is a report the doctors always prepare promptly upon the discharge of
our patients in the routine or regular course at the hospital. After it was prepared,
it was placed in the permanent ﬁle we keep on every patient that is treated in the

My Commission Expires at Death.
Statement of Ernest Potter
My name is Ernest Potter, I am seventy-ﬁve years old, and I reside at the Happy
Valley Nursing Home – all of which is against my will. About the only good thing
that’s happened to me since my daughter stuck me here in the so-called Happy
Valley is that I met up with James Warren, rest his soul. We spent a lot of time
together, and we got to be really good friends before he died. I never had much use
for his daughter, Susan, and I think it was mutual judging from the way she used to
stare at my crippled hand and my wheel chair like I was something from outer space.
It was always a wonder to me that my friend James continued to look forward to
her visits, which were pretty frequent, just as though she hadn’t run him out of his
own house and home and dumped him in a nursing home. I expect he might have
looked forward to her visits mainly because he was crazy about his grandchildren,
Kim and James. You could look around his side of our room and tell that from
all the pictures he kept hanging on the wall of those kids. The only time we ever
talked about James’s son, Jim, was when he would talk about how disappointed he
was that Jim had turned out to be a starving artist trying to make it as an actor.
He told me he had the guilties about divorcing Jim’s mother, Elizabeth Warren,
right after young Jim was born, since he never spent any time being Jim’s father
after that. I used to try to talk him out of worrying so much about his kids, since
I didn’t think they were apparently very worried about him at the time, especially
after old Susan married “the Golddigger,” as James used to call him. Once or twice
the Golddigger, Bill Gearhart, would come along with little Susan to visit James,
and I could see James immediately change into a bad mood. He would either get
depressed or red-faced angry, and pretty soon they’d be arguing like they always

did about how much high-living Bill Gearhart was doing. I remember one day they
had a really big argument about the fact that the Golddigger had put the kids into
a private school, which James thought was too expensive and would turn the kids
into pampered weaklings.
A couple of months before James passed away, rest his soul, he got a phone call
from his son, Jim, from New York. It really did him a lot of good, kicked his spirits
up pretty high. From what I heard, a part of the conversation concerned Jim’s asking
for some help, because I heard James say, “It’s about time I did something for my
own son, so don’t be ashamed of asking.” They talked for about half an hour, and
James hung up and said to me, “Well, Ernest, I’ve still got a chance to be a father to
my son, and I’m going to do it this time.” We talked a lot longer, about how glad he
was to have heard from Jim.
Right then, he sat down and wrote a letter, to Jim I think, although I don’t know
whether he mailed it.
I’ll never forget the day James had his stroke, right there in our room, and I
called the people in charge at the Home and told them he was bad sick, and that
was on October 28, last year, right after breakfast. As soon as they came and got
James and took him around to the hospital wing of the Home, I went through
James’s telephone number book until I found his son’s number in New York. I
called him and told him that his dad had had a stroke. Early the next morning, Jim
arrived from New York and came directly to my room to thank me for having called
him and to visit with me about his dad. Then he went on up to the hospital wing
to visit with his dad, and I didn’t see him again until the morning of the 31st of
October.
I never did see that Susan, and I don’t know if she even bothered to come by to
see James in the hospital, but I do know the nurses said they had called her to tell
her that he had apparently suffered a stroke. I never heard from anybody where she
was, but I think it would have done James some good to get to see his grandchildren
if she had bothered to bring them up there.
On the morning of October 31, last year, Jim came by my room and told me that
James wanted me to come in for a visit, and Jim told me that he had been with his
father constantly since he had arrived. Jim then rolled me around to the hospital
wing and we went in to see James together. James looked tired and not well at all.
He told me he was glad to see me, and we just talked a little bit generally. He seemed
to be at peace with himself. He told me he had really enjoyed spending some time
with his son, Jim, at last, and that he had something really important to do that
I could help him with. He told me he wanted me to come back after supper that
night, because he thought he would have something for me to sign and keep for
him. During the conversation, he never even brought up Susan or her kids, or the
Golddigger.
Later in the day, I don’t remember when, I got a call from Jim reminding me
to be back after supper, and I told him I sure would be. He also mentioned to me

Analysis of Evidence
that I should not bring up Susan or her family, because he thought that might
upset James. Of course, right after suppertime, about 6:30 p.m., I went on back
down to see James, since I sure wanted to help him with anything I could. As I
pushed open the door, Jim looked a little startled at me, and just as I was about
to come in, James sat up in bed and looked in my direction and said just as plain
as anything, “Is that you, Elizabeth?” Jim put his hands on his shoulders and sort
of pushed him back into the bed and asked him to be calm and not worry any
more and said a few things like that to him in a very kindly way. James never
said anything else I could understand while I was there for the next few minutes,
and he just kept staring at Jim and had a little smile on his face. I was only there
a few minutes when Jim asked me to come on out in the hall. He handed me a
piece of paper and told me that it was the thing James had wanted me to help
with. Jim told me it was his dad’s will, and he said to me, “Ernest, you should
take this and put this in Dad’s room, wherever he keeps his papers, and don’t
ever tell anyone about it, until I give you the go ahead. That’s the way Dad would
want it.”
I took the Will back to my room, and the next morning, I decided to read it. I
could see that it was in James’ handwriting, and since he had told me that there
was something he wanted me to sign, I ﬁgured he wanted me to be his witness on
his Will. So I wrote down at the bottom of it, “I, Ernest Potter, am a witness to this
Will.”
That night, on October 31, James passed away, and I lost the best friend a man
could have. The next morning, Jim came by my room and picked up the Will from
me. Since that time, Jim has been kind enough to stay in touch with me by a few
phone calls and visits at the Home. In fact, I hear more often from him than I do
my own daughter.

The trial lawyer’s standpoint
369
When I was two years old, my mother and my father divorced, and my mother
eventually told me that the divorce came about due to my father’s having devel-
oped a relationship with Mary, whom he later married. For the ﬁrst few years of
my childhood, I had little contact with my father, since the divorce was not on a
particularly pleasant basis, but I always received a Christmas present and a birthday
present from him every year. I don’t know what kind of support he might have sent
my mother to raise me, but I know that I did not receive anything from my father
to help me get through college or drama school, although I was well aware that he
could afford to help me if he chose. During my last year in college, I traveled to
Happy Valley, Nocona, to renew my relationship with my father. That was when I
ﬁrst met Susan Warren Gearhart, my half-sister.
In advance of my trip, I called to make arrangements with my dad, but I was only
able to speak with Susan. She seemed very unhappy about my plan to visit with
my dad, but I ignored her. When I arrived in Happy Valley, I was not very warmly
received by Susan or her mother, Mary, who was still living at that time. As it turned
out, they had not even told my father that I would be arriving, and I suppose they
just hoped I might not ever show up due to the way they had discouraged me from
coming. My father took some time off from his work to visit with me, and I really
enjoyed meeting him.
At the time, I looked pretty much like a bum or a “hippie.” I guess my father
was a little bit disturbed by my appearance, and he told me I probably wouldn’t be
able to make very much of a career for myself by being a drama major in college.
On the other hand, he was genuinely glad to get to visit with me and encouraged
me to come back whenever I could ﬁnd time in the future. As I was leaving, Susan
offered to take me to the bus station. During that ride, Susan told me I should
not return to Happy Valley because it upset her mother, Mary, too much, and she
explained that Mary was in a very weak physical condition. She told me my father
was doing ﬁne and was very happy and that I should not stir up any problems for
him or his family. She said if anything ever came up that I should know about that
she would certainly keep in contact with me. Then, of all things, when I got out
of the car she jammed two $50 bills into my shirt pocket and told me she hoped
that would help me out a little. I guess I didn’t really hold that against her any,
and I certainly did look like a bum, but that was a pretty insulting thing for her
to do.
Over the next many years, I was able to speak with my father only a few times,
since most of the telephone calls to his home were intercepted by Susan. I never
heard back from him when Susan took my calls. I really didn’t put too much more
effort into getting in touch with my father, because I was working so hard on trying
to make it as an actor, or as a playwright. I got mixed up with drugs once and had a
hard time pulling myself back together, and I wouldn’t doubt but that Susan made
sure her father learned about that. Finally, I got some real encouragement by the
success of one of my plays at a community theatre, and I took my life and my writing
more seriously.

Analysis of Evidence
In about April of last year, I ﬁnished one of my scripts and took it around to
several agents, producers and other people in the business to see whether they
thought it might be a Broadway potential. Nearly everyone I spoke with told me it
looked like it had the makings of a big success. The only problem was that everyone
I spoke with told me I’d have to give up almost all of the proﬁts on the thing to
those who would be providing ﬁnancial backing for the production. The more I
checked into it, the more I realized that if I couldn’t put up a healthy sum of money
of my own, that I’d have to give up all of the control over the production, as well as
almost all of the proﬁt in order to get the play produced. It was then that I began
considering contacting my dad to see if he would provide me with some ﬁnancial
help.
Sometime mid-May 20, I tried to contact my dad, but Susan received the phone
call and was pretty vague about where my father was and whether or not he would
call me back. I tried again to call my father sometime in the middle of July, and
the same thing happened. Finally, in early October I called the house and Susan’s
husband, Bill Gearhart, answered, and he told me that my father was in the Happy
Valley Nursing Home and gave me the telephone number. I couldn’t believe my
father was in a nursing home, since Susan had not even told me he was in poor
health, much less that she had put him in a home.
On October 12, I called my dad and spoke with him in a long telephone conver-
sation which must have lasted over an hour. It was the best talk we ever had. My
dad was very interested in helping me ﬁnance my play, and he talked about loaning
me some money or working out some way by which he could help me protect my
interest in my work. He had a lot of personal things to say to me, which he had
never expressed before, about his own feelings about having not been around when
I was a kid and not having been responsible for helping me out with anything.
I told him that none of that was important and that, of course, I didn’t expect
him to help me out now just to make up for all the things he had failed to do in
the past.
Shortly after that I received a letter from him which again stated his interest in
helping me with my play. I was making plans to visit with him as soon as I could
get away from New York. Then, out of the blue, came a call from Ernest Potter, who
explained that he was my father’s roommate at Happy Valley Nursing Home. He
told me my father had suffered a stroke and was in pretty bad shape. I thanked him
and told him I would be coming to Happy Valley as soon as I could get there and
that I would come by his room to see him.
I traveled all night long to get to Happy Valley, Nocona, and when I arrived the
next morning at the Happy Valley Nursing Home, I headed to the room number
on my dad’s letter. A nurse saw me about to enter the room and asked if I knew
Mr. Warren, and 1 explained that I was his son. I have since learned that this nurse’s
name is Pat Duffey. She told me that they had just received a call that Mr. Warren’s
daughter, Susan, had been involved in a car wreck on the way to the hospital. The

nurse said Susan received some injuries to her face and other injuries that were not
life threatening. The nurse said Susan could not come to see her father as a result.
She explained that it would be best for Mr. Warren, in his condition, not to know
about the incident, and she asked me to be certain not to mention it. She further
stated she was glad I was going to be there in order that someone from the family
would be present during Mr. Warren’s recovery period. I went on to my dad’s and
Ernest Potter’s room, and Ernest was there. He seemed really happy to meet me,
and I sat down for a few minutes to inquire as to my dad’s condition. He said he
didn’t know very much, and so I went on to the hospital wing to see my father.
When I arrived at his room, I found my father awake and quite alert. He was glad
to see me, but he asked why I had bothered to ﬂy out to see him before he returned to
feeling a little better. I explained to him that I wanted to be there with him because I
thought he might need me for support and comfort while he attempted to get back
on his feet. We then began talking generally about just a lot of things, nothing in
particular. I guess we must have talked a couple of hours that morning, which was
October 29, I believe. I would say that I did most of the talking, since he was still
having some speech problems. A few times, he asked me about where Susan was,
and I pretty much dodged the question. As soon as they brought in his medication,
around noon, I left to go and check into a motel room and came back later in the
afternoon for about an hour. Then I came to visit him for a couple of hours in
the early evening. His condition stayed about the same all day long, and he was
extremely pleased to see me. He asked me to come spend the day with him the next
day.
The next day, which was October 30, I brought some of my work to his room to
sit there and write some letters to some people I was working with on my new play.
Of course, in my father’s condition, I couldn’t bring up the topic of my need for
some ﬁnancial support from him, but we did talk about my work a little bit, and
he seemed very interested in my telling him about some of the things I had written.
He also asked me to talk to him about Elizabeth, my mother, and about our life in
New York City. I spent most of the day just sitting either in his room or down the
hall working on my own things, since I didn’t want him to tire out. During the day,
Susan called while I was there and I told her he was doing quite well and I’m sure
I told her who I was. She showed about as much interest in me as she always had.
Also, once when I was down the hall, I saw a man walk in to see my father while
my father was sleeping, and I subsequently learned that it was Bill Gearhart. I don’t
know whether they were able to visit, but I doubt it, since my father was asleep at
the time. Just as I was about to leave on the evening of October 30, [last year], my
dad asked me to be sure and come back to visit the next day, and then he said to
me, “I really doubt that I will ever live to see the outside of this hospital, and there
are a few things I haven’t taken care of yet.”
The next morning when I returned to my father’s room, he asked me to get Ernest
Potter to come visit him. I did so, and he and Ernest had a nice visit that morning.

Analysis of Evidence
I really can’t recall any of the details of their conversation, though I think he told
Ernest he would like for him to come back and visit him again sometime.
After Ernest left, my dad told me that he wanted to write something, and he
asked me to give him a piece of paper and a pen. Later in the day, about 5:30 or so,
he started writing on the piece of paper. At the time, I observed him to be normal
and mentally alert. He was a little bit tired at the time, and when I suggested that
he stop worrying about writing anything, he got very upset and even cried a little
bit and pleaded with me to help him get on with what he intended to do. At one
point he did ask me to steady his hand a bit because it was shaking. When I did so,
I observed only a few of the words he was writing, and I didn’t really know what
he was doing. When he ﬁnished, he folded the piece of paper and placed it on his
bedside table. Sometime later, I observed his breathing to become somewhat forced,
and I contacted the nurses’ station to tell them to come check on him. From that
point on, his condition seemed to change for the worse. During that evening, Ernest
Potter came by for a few minutes, and he said, “I’m here like your dad asked.” When
Ernest left, I went outside and handed to him the piece of paper that my dad had
been writing out, which I assumed to be either a loan to me or a letter to someone,
and I might have even thought at that time that it was a will. I don’t really recall
telling Ernest that the paper was my dad’s will or anything else I may have said to
Ernest at the time, since I was so upset.
Shortly after Ernest left, my dad’s condition got so much worse that I was forced
to leave the room. The nurses and doctors were there for the rest of the evening,
and shortly after 11:30 p.m., the same nurse who had spoken with me on the ﬁrst
date of my arrival, Pat Duffey, came outside to tell me that my father had suffered
an additional stroke and had passed away as a result.
The next morning I went by to see Ernest Potter to thank him for his friendship
and kindness extended to me and my father. It was at that time that Ernest gave me
the will my father had written. I then observed that Ernest had written on the will
that he was a witness to it, and I asked him why he had done that. Ernest told me
that he thought that would make everything legal and that he knew that was what
my dad wanted. I think Ernie Potter is a very good man, and I have kept in touch
with him since that time.

Charge of the Court
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY:
This case is submitted to you on special interrogatories consisting of speciﬁc
questions about the facts, which you must answer from the evidence you have
heard in this trial. You are the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the
weight to be given their testimony, but in matters of law, you must be governed by
the instructions in this charge. I shall now give you additional instructions which
you should carefully and strictly follow during your deliberations.
1 Do not let bias, prejudice, or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.
2 Since every answer that is required by the charge is important, no juror should state or
consider that any required answer is not important.
3 You must not decide whom you think should win, and then try to answer the
questions accordingly.
4 Certain words are used in this charge for which you are given a proper legal deﬁnition,
and you are bound to accept the Court’s deﬁnition in place of any other meaning.
5 There is no “Dead Man’s Statute” in the state of Nocona, and thus you may consider
in your deliberations whatever evidence the Court may have admitted, with any
limiting instructions, pertaining to the decedent.
6 Answer with “Yes” or “No” unless otherwise instructed. A “Yes” answer must be based
on a preponderance of the evidence. If you do not ﬁnd that a preponderance of the
evidence supports a “Yes” answer, then answer “No.”
7 PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE means the greater weight and degree
of credible testimony or evidence introduced before you and admitted in this case.
INTERROGATORY NO. 1: Do you ﬁnd from a preponderance of the evidence
that at the time James Dale Warren, Deceased, executed the holographic will dated
October 31, last year, introduced in evidence in this case, he had testamentary
capacity?
Deﬁnition: “Testamentary capacity.” In connection with the foregoing interrogatory,
you are instructed that, for a person to have “testamentary capacity,” as that term is
used in this charge, such person at the time of the execution of the will must have had
sufﬁcient mental ability to understand the business in which he was engaged, the effect
of his act in making the will, the nature and extent of his property; he must have been
able to know his next of kin and the natural objects of his bounty and their claims
upon him; he must have memory sufﬁcient to collect in his mind the elements of the
business about to be transacted and to hold them long enough to perceive at least their
obvious relation to each other and to be able to form a reasonable judgment as to
them.
ANSWER TO INTERROGATORY NO. 1:
Answer “Yes” or “No”
INTERROGATORY NO. 2: Do you ﬁnd from a preponderance of the evidence
that at the time James Dale Warren executed the holographic will dated October 31,

last year, introduced in evidence in this case, he was caused to do so under and by
reason of the undue inﬂuence of Jim Warren?
Deﬁnition: “Undue inﬂuence.” In connection with the foregoing interrogatory, you
are instructed that the term “undue inﬂuence” means such improper domination,
constraint,orcontrolofoneperson,exercisedoverthemindofanotherastobesufﬁcient
to subvert and overthrow such other person’s volition, so that the party inﬂuenced has
been thereby induced to do what he would not have done had he been left to act freely
andvoluntarily.Theinﬂuencemustbesuchthattheactsodonerepresentsaresultofthe
exercise of such domination, constraint or control, rather than the will and expression
of the party doing the act. Undue inﬂuence may be any fraudulent or designing means
employed upon and with the maker of a will by which, under the circumstances and
conditions by which such maker was surrounded, he could not well resist and which
controlled his volition and induced him to do that which otherwise he would not have
done.

Glossary of terms and symbols
A. Terms
Throughout this book, we have introduced and used terms that embody concepts
in the ﬁelds of evidence and logic. Many of the terms regularly used in discourse
about the law of evidence are also employed in discourse about logic and the logic of
proof, terms such as relevance, material facts, and probative value. Other terms are
primarily used in the study of logic and may not be familiar even to those who have
studied the law of evidence, terms such as catenate inferences, cognitive competence,
conjunction, and convergence. Finally, there are terms that relate primarily to the
studyofproofinanadjudicativesettingandhavespecialmeaningsforthoseinvolved
in that ﬁeld, terms such as theory of a case, story, and theme.
The purpose of this glossary is to provide students with basic deﬁnitions of the
main terms used in this book that may be unfamiliar. Most of these terms embody
concepts that require careful analysis and elucidation. To the extent required, we
havedevelopedtheseconceptsinthetext.Someofthesetermsembodycontroversial
concepts, and there may be disagreement about their precise meaning. For these, we
have chosen the meaning that facilitates the points developed here and have simply
stipulated that to be the meaning of the term as used in this book.

and further aid, we have parenthetically identiﬁed the pages where the more novel
or difﬁcult terms are discussed and developed in the text. Students may also wish to
consult standard texts or treatises on the law of evidence for further ampliﬁcation
of some of the terms deﬁned here.
Abductivereasoning.
Acreativeprocessofusingknowndatatogeneratehypothe-
ses to be tested by further investigation.
Accuracy.
Also termed sensitivity. An attribute of the credibility of certain kinds
of tangible evidence such as those provided by sensing devices and tabled
information.

Glossary of terms and symbols
Ancillary evidence.
Evidence about other evidence and its probative strength;
also termed indirectly relevant evidence. Such evidence acts either to increase or
to reduce the strength of links in chains of reasoning set up by directly relevant
evidence (q. v.).
Authenticity.
An attribute of the credibility of tangible evidence referring to
whether a tangible item is what it is represented to be.
Autoptic proference.
Literally, evidence that will be perceived by the tribunal
through one of its senses. Wigmore used the term for what is conventionally
referred to as “real evidence,” a term which he considered ambiguous. In this
book it is used to include testimonial assertions the tribunal will hear, as well as
other evidence it will perceive with its senses.
Bias.
A term commonly used with reference to witnesses who provide testimonial
evidence. The term usually refers to the extent to which a witness’s interests,
incentives, or stakes may inﬂuence what this witness observed or reported. There
are several different kinds of bias that may inﬂuence a witness’s observations,
objectivity, and veracity.
Catenate inferences.
A series of inferences forming a chain; inferences upon
inferences.
Circumstantial evidence.
Circumstantial evidence is evidence that makes the
existence of a penultimate probandum more or less probable “indirectly,” in that
at least one further inferential step is involved. In legal usage sometimes con-
trasted loosely with testimonial evidence. Circumstantial evidence is the most
common kind of evidence in legal proceedings. Subject to the rules of admissi-
bility it can be relevant, valid, and of probative value. It is a common error to
treat circumstantial evidence as inferior to testimonial or real evidence.
Cognitivecompetence.
Ability to know and understand information on the basis
of the general stock of knowledge in a given society. In the logic of proof, it is
generally assumed that nearly all adult members of society are capable of drawing
upon a shared common stock of knowledge and applying ordinary principles of
practical reasoning.
Cognitive consensus.
The idea that there is a generally shared “stock of knowl-
edge” in a given society, commonly reﬂected by common sense generalizations
or generally known facts of which a tribunal will take judicial notice or the like.
Combination.
A logical process by which judgments about the probability that
individual elements of a compound proposition are true are combined into a
judgmentabouttheprobabilitythatthecompoundpropositionasawholeistrue.
Whether and by what process individual judgments may properly be combined
is the subject of serious controversy and theoretical debate. Cf. Conjunction,
Probability.

Glossary of terms and symbols
381
Conﬂicting evidence.
Evidence about events that can occur jointly but which
favor different probanda or propositions. For example, evidence about one event
may favor proposition P while evidence about another event may favor propo-
sition not-P.
Conjunction.
The combination of judgments about the probability of individual
facts in issue into a single judgment about the case as a whole. “The problem of
conjunction” refers to the contested issue whether legal standards of proof apply
to the ultimate probandum (a compound proposition) and the case as a whole
or to individual penultimate probanda (material facts) separately.
Contradictory evidence.
Evidence about two or more events that are mutually
exclusive, i.e. they cannot occur jointly. For example, one evidence item says
that event E occurred and another evidence item says that event E did not
occur.
Convergence.
Two inferences converge when they combine together to support
or negate an interim or penultimate probandum.
Corroboration.
Literally, strengthening, as when two witnesses independently
testify to the truth of the same proposition (cf. convergence). The term is used
in at least two senses: (1) to signify the production of an additional witness or
two, duplicating the assertion of a prior witness; or (2) to signify the auxiliary
evidential facts offered by a proponent to negative the explanations by which the
opponent seeks to weaken the inference from some original evidentiary fact of
the proponent. In the latter aspect, “corroboration” involves not a new logical
process, but a new stage in the presentation of evidence.
Credential [of evidence].
A term used to describe a property of evidence that
needs to be established or justiﬁed. Three major credentials of evidence are:
relevance, credibility, and probative force.
Credibility.
Concerns the extent to which an item of evidence or a source of
evidence may be believed. On occasion, this term is wrongly equated with the
term reliability [q.v.], which has a more restricted deﬁnition. As a credential of
evidence, credibility or believability has several different attributes that depend
upon the form of evidence, whether it is tangible or testimonial.
Credibility attributes [for tangible evidence].
These attributes are: authenticity,
accuracy, and reliability.
Credibility attributes [for testimonial evidence].
These attributes are: veracity,
objectivity, and observational sensitivity.
Deductive argument.
The form of argument in which a major premise is applied
to a minor premise to establish that a conclusion is valid. In evidential reasoning,
the major premise may be a proposition of law or, more often, a generalization.

382
Glossary of terms and symbols
Direct evidence.
In legal usage the term is ambiguous: it is sometimes used in
contrast with circumstantial evidence (q.v.) or with hearsay (q.v.) or with ancil-
lary evidence, which is indirectly relevant (q.v.). In a narrow sense it refers to
testimony from a witness who states that she actually saw, heard, or otherwise
experienced a material fact in issue (e.g., “I saw X cause Y’s death”).
Directly relevant evidence.
Evidence is said to be directly relevant if a defensible
chain of reasoning can be constructed that links this evidence with a major
proposition whose proof is at issue.
Discovery.
This term is used in two different ways in applications in law. The
ﬁrst, called investigative discovery, refers to the evidence, hypotheses, and argu-
ments generated by an attorney or other enquirer during fact investigation. The
other, called legal discovery, refers to the legally sanctioned process of obtaining
evidence from a usually unwilling opponent. In England the latter is now called
“disclosure.”
Eliminative induction.
A method of proof in which a variety of evidential tests
are employed in an effort to eliminate alternative hypotheses being considered.
The hypothesis that best resists our attempts to eliminate any hypothesis is the
one that can be taken most seriously.
Epistemology.
A branch of philosophy concerning the acquisition of and validity
of knowledge.
Evidence.
Any facts considered by the tribunal as data to persuade them to reach
a reasoned belief on a probandum. The term is sometimes used to refer to
evidential data or autoptic proferences and sometimes to refer to other facts
taken as established for purposes of argument.
Evidence and events.
There is an important distinction to be made between evi-
dence of some event and the event itself. Having evidence that an event occurred
does not entail that this event did occur. What is at issue is the credibility of the
evidence and its source(s).
Evidential data.
See autoptic proference.
Evidentiary fact.
See factum probans.
Fact.
Any event or act or condition of things, assumed (for the moment) as having
happened or having existed.
Fact of consequence.
An important probandum. The term is slightly wider than
material facts in that it refers to probanda undermining or reinforcing the cred-
ibility of evidence as well as to ultimate and penultimate probanda.

383
Facts in issue.
Material facts or facts constituting the elements of an ultimate
probandum; not necessarily disputed facts, for some elements of an ultimate
probandum may not be a matter of contention between the parties. “A fact-in-
issue is a fact as to the correctness of which the tribunal, under the law of the case,
must be persuaded” (J. Wigmore (1935) 7). Exceptionally, a fact in issue may be
one of a set of jointly sufﬁcient conditions rather than a necessary condition for
success in a case: for example, one of a series of defenses, any one of which is
sufﬁcient to exonerate a defendant in a civil or criminal case (e.g., self-defense or
insanity in a criminal case or fair comment or qualiﬁed privilege in a defamation
action).
Factum probandum.
A proposition to be proved. See probandum; compare inter-
mediate probandum, penultimate probandum, and ultimate probandum.
Factum probans.
Evidencing the proposition to be proved: A factual proposition
offered as support for a further inferred proposition, i.e. a factum probandum.
Generalization.
A general proposition claimed to be true which is used implicitly
or explicitly to argue that a conclusion has been established. All or almost all
inductive arguments can be translated into syllogistic form by articulating as a
universal the assumed generalization which provides the basis for the induction
claimed.
Hearsay.
A statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at
trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.
Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).
Hypothesis.
A general proposition put forward as a possible explanation for
known facts from which additional investigations can be planned to generate
evidential data that will tend to strengthen or weaken the basis for accepting
the proposition as the best or strongest explanation of the available data.
Inductive argument.
An argument that one proposition (taken as established),
a factum probans, makes another proposition in the case, a factum probandum,
more or less probable than it otherwise would be. The argument is frequently by
analogy and almost always rests upon an assumed generalization upon whose
acceptance the strength of the argument depends.
Inference.
“The process of thought, by which we reason from evidence toward
proof . . . ” J. Wigmore (1935).
Inference upon inference.
See catenate inferences.
Interim probandum.
A proposition to be proved which itself will tend to support
or negate, directly or indirectly, an ultimate probandum as part of a chain of
inferences. Such a proposition is a factum probandum in relation to propositions

offered as supporting it and a factum probans in relation to propositions for
which it is offered as support.
Judicial notice.
“A judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable
dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction
of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort
to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.” Fed. R. Evid.
201(a).
Marshaling.
Refers to the bringing together of thoughts and evidence during
fact investigation and argument construction. Having useful strategies for
marshaling thus helps advance the processes of fact investigation and of proof.
Marshaling magnets.
New hypotheses or probanda are frequently generated by
considering combinations of existing information. A marshaling “magnet” is a
metaphoric description of evidence marshaling operations that serve to attract
particular combinations of evidence from some collection of data or triﬂes and
that can assist in generating new hypotheses or probanda or that can open up
new lines of inquiry and evidence.
Material facts.
See ultimate probandum, facts in issue, and penultimate pro-
banda.
Penultimate probanda.
Simple propositions, each of which state one element of
a crime or claim or defense that must be established in order for the proponent
to prevail. The penultimate probanda in a case can be derived from the ultimate
probandum or probanda for the case and represent the decomposing of a
compound proposition into simple propositions identifying each of its essential
components. For most purposes, each of the penultimate probanda is a material
fact or a fact in issue.
Probability.
“The word ‘probable’ as used in everyday discourse describes a
state of affairs which we do not know for certain to be the case, but which
we are well inclined to believe . . .” In its more technical usage, the term
“probability” denotes a quantitative measure of the uncertainty associated
with some unknown state of affairs – or, as it is technically called, “event.”
(See Dawid, appendix.) Differing conceptions of probability are a matter of
considerable controversy and debate within statistics and the logic of proof.
Probandum.
Literally, a proposition to be proved. An ultimate probandum is
a proposition which must be proved to some speciﬁed degree by the party
asserting it in order to succeed in the case, i.e., the material facts or facts in
issue. See also factum probandum, interim probandum, penultimate probanda,
and ultimate probandum.
Probative force or value.
A term denoting a judgment about (a) the importance

degree to which that data might alter the probability that the fact of consequence
was or was not true. Probative value is the term usually employed in assessing
the signiﬁcance of speciﬁed evidential data for determining whether it should be
admitted notwithstanding otherwise improper prejudicial effects the data may
have. In contrast, “weight” is the term ordinarily employed in assessing the extent
towhichthewholeoftheevidenceinacaseestablishestheultimateprobandumor
probanda to the degree of certainty required by the applicable standard of proof.
Proof.
“The persuasive operation of the total mass of evidentiary facts, as to a
probandum.” (Wigmore (1937) 9.) See, further, Standard of proof.
Proposition.
A statement that is true or false, that can be afﬁrmed or denied.
Quantitative rules.
Rules that require certain kinds of evidence to be produced
in speciﬁed quantity (e.g., “corroborated”).
Quantum of evidence.
The amount of evidence; see also quantitative rules.
Real evidence.
Typically, physical evidence presented to the fact-ﬁnder. See
autoptic proference.
Redundancy.
Applied to evidence, this term refers to evidence that either says
the same thing over again or does not add anything to what we already have. (In
law, the term cumulative is often used with reference to redundant evidence.)
Relevance.
“Relevant evidence” means evidence having any tendency to make
the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the
action more probable or less probable than it would have been without the
evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 401.
Reliability.
A reliable process is one that is repeatable or consistent. The term
is usually applied to devices and tests of various kinds. This term is often used
incorrectly as a synonym for the term credibility or believability, which involves
other attributes.
Simple proposition.
A proposition that makes only one point: for example, “It
was X who murdered Y” as contrasted with “X murdered Y.” As a rule of thumb
nearly all items on a key-list should be simple propositions.
Standard for decision.
The generic term for the standard that an ofﬁcial or
functionary is required or expected to apply in respect of a given decision. For
example, the standard that a prosecuting authority has to satisfy with respect to a
decisiontoprosecute.Standardsofproofareonespeciesofstandardsfordecision.
Standard of proof.
The degree of persuasion required for the proponent to
establish a particular fact in issue (or, possibly, the case as a whole). The
standard of proof in civil cases is typically “the preponderance of the evidence”
or “the balance of probabilities.” In criminal cases the prosecution has to

Glossary of terms and symbols
satisfy the standard of “beyond reasonable doubt” in order to succeed. In some
non-criminal cases, the standard of proof is said to be “clear and convincing.”
There is controversy as to whether the standard of proof applies independently
to each fact in issue or, by conjunction, to the probability of the facts in issue in
respect of the case as a whole (the problem of conjunction).
Story.
“A narrative of particular events arranged in a time sequence and forming
a meaningful totality.” Rethinking 223 (adapted from Ricoeur).
Substance-blind.
A term used to describe a particular way of categorizing forms
and combinations of evidence without regard to its substance or content. Such
a categorization is based on the inferential properties of evidence and not on its
content.
Tangible evidence.
Evidence that can be directly examined by persons drawing
conclusions to see what event(s) this evidence reveals. Examples include objects,
documents, images, measurements, and charts.
Testimonial evidence.
Evidence provided by a human source to the evaluator
of the evidence. Testimonial evidence about some event can be based on direct
observations, secondhand reports from another source, or on the basis of
opinion or inferences based on information about the occurrence of other
events. In law: evidence given by a competent witness under oath or afﬁrmation
and in the presence of the tribunal.
Theme.
An element in an argument that is considered sufﬁciently important by
the person presenting the argument to deserve emphasis by repetition.
Theory of a case.
An overall strategic argument concerning the case as a whole,
typically used by an advocate or judge to structure the argument and guide
choices on particular aspects of it.
Ultimateprobandum.
The proposition of fact that the proponent (the party with
the burden of proof) must establish or negate in order to prevail in the case.
Viewing the rule of law that governs the case as a major premise, the ultimate
probandum is the minor premise that, if all of its elements were proved, would
compel the conclusion that its proponent urges. In a case in which the prose-
cution or a plaintiff alleges separate crimes or claims or in which a defendant
alleges an afﬁrmative defense upon which she has the burden of proof, there
may be more than one ultimate probandum, i.e. multiple ultimate probanda.
Warrant.
A term used in argument construction to refer to the grounds or
license for linking one proposition to another in a chain of reasoning. Warrants
and their backing by ancillary evidence are said to form the “glue” holding an
argument together. See also Generalization.
Weight.
See Probative force or value.

B. Symbols
The modiﬁed Wigmorean charting system or palette presented in this book requires
only eight symbols. Five are likely to be required for any chart:
(1) the square for depicting testimonial assertions;
⃝
(2) the circle for depicting circumstantial evidence or inferred proposi-
tions;
<
(3) the open angle to identify an argument that provides an alternative
explanation for an inference proposed by the other side;
◁
(4) a vertical triangle to identify an argument that corroborates a proposed
inference;
→
↑
(5) a line to indicate the “direction” of a proposed inferential relation-
ship between or among propositions – vertical line indicates “tends
to support”; horizontal lines indicate “tends to negate or weaken.”
The direction from evidential data to asserted inferences is always up,
from bottom to top. Directional arrows are only occasionally necessary
where the line standing alone might be misunderstood.
The nature of a judicial trial makes it necessary to have symbols to identify the
kinds of evidential data or the source of the propositions the tribunal will be asked
to take as the basis for the arguments advanced. Wigmore speciﬁed two, and we
have found a third useful:
∞
(6) an inﬁnity symbol to identify testimonial assertions that the fact-
ﬁnders will hear or other autoptic proferences they will perceive with
their other senses;
¶
(7) a paragraph symbol to identify facts the tribunal will judicially notice
or otherwise accept without evidential support; and
G
(8) theletter“G”todenoteageneralizationthatislikelytoplayasigniﬁcant
role in an argument in a case, but that is not a proposition that will be
supported by evidence or that the tribunal will be formally asked to
notice judicially.
