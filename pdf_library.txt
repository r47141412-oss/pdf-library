Research indicates that argumenta -\ntive writing is crucial for academic achievement ( Preiss et al., 2013 ). Proficiency in argu -\nmentative writing also fosters essential 21st-  century skills, such as critical thinking and \ncommunication ( UNESCO, 2016 ). However, many students struggle to become proficient \nargumentative writers ( Baffour et al., 2023 ).\nRegular and formative feedback on student writing can be a powerful tool for improving \nwriting outcomes, and a vast body of research shows that feedback is most effective when \nit is clear, timely, and focused on the task ( Hattie, 2008 ). AWE systems are computer-  based \napplications that can assess student writing and provide feedback using algorithms and \ncomputational techniques. The nature of AWE systems can augment the grading, evalu -\nation, and feedback process for student writing ( Stevenson, 2016 ). However, their impact \nis limited to the underlying algorithms’ accuracy, precision, and implementation. Most \npersonalized feedback in argumentative writing is given at the overall essay level, where \nstudents typically receive holistic ratings like numeric scores or letter grades as evaluative \nfeedback. Although these scores offer a baseline understanding of writing performance, \nthey do not provide sufficient formative feedback to guide improvement. Pinpointed feed -\nback at the discourse level that focuses on spans of text that perform specific rhetorical or \nargumentative functions offers students localized insights rather than broad evaluations, \nmaking it easier for them to understand and implement revisions.\nDiscourse-  level feedback can be given for organization, strength of evidence, idea devel -\nopment, and coherence. Although these features are commonly evaluated in classroom \nrubrics, capturing and evaluating them in detail remains challenging for even the most \nadvanced NLP algorithms and language models ( Farrokhnia et al., 2023 ). When feedback  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 2 ---\nPerpetual Baffour and Scott Crossley\n304is provided to students at the discourse level, students can better understand the different \ncomponents of argumentation. They have increased awareness and metacognition of their \nlearning and writing processes ( Arroyo González et al., 2021 ), and they can better identify \nopportunities to strengthen their arguments. For example, a student receiving tailored feed -\nback on their thesis statement or conclusion can improve their understanding of effective \norganizational structure.\nAn important component of AWE systems is fairness because some student populations \nare marginalized due to existing achievement disparities ( Fenu et al., 2022 ). AI algorithms, \noften trained on real-  world data, can inadvertently reflect and amplify these inherent soci -\netal biases ( Schramowski et al., 2022 ). Thus, confirming that the AI models that underpin \nAWE systems are not biased is crucial to ensuring that vulnerable populations are given \nfair, just, and accurate feedback. The goal of this chapter is to examine newly developed AI \nmodels resulting from the Feedback Prize. The Feedback Prize was a series of data analysis \nchallenges hosted from 2020 to 2023 that tasked participants with developing AI models \nto provide formative feedback to writers at the discourse level. This chapter examines the \noutput of the AI models developed to provide writing support and whether these models \nperform differentially on various target populations (i.e., display bias). Providing targeted \nfeedback at the argument level, especially for historically underperforming students, is \nbeneficial to students because it can help instill beliefs that challenges in achievement can \nbe overcome through deliberate practice ( Brown et al., 2016 ).\n16.2 The Feedback Prize\nThe Feedback Prize project was designed to address challenges in delivering writing feed -\nback to students about argumentation. The purpose of the project was to foster innovation \nin AWEs through open datasets, open-  source algorithms, and data science competitions. \nThe project resulted in the creation and release of the Persuasive Essays for Rating, \nSelecting, and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus \n(Crossley et al., 2022 ). This corpus is the most extensive publicly available collection of stu -\ndent writing annotated for common discourse elements found in argumentative essays. The \ncorpus also includes demographic information for individual writers. Three open science \ncompetitions were hosted on Kaggle.com as part of the Feedback Prize. These competitions \nresulted in over 100,000 solutions to classify argumentative elements and assign proficiency \nscores to those elements. The competition entries are freely available on Kaggle to help \nfoster ongoing research on argumentation, discourse, and algorithmic bias.\n16.2.1  Corpus Annotation\nThe PERSUADE corpus was created by collecting and curating student writing samples \non argumentative topics and then annotating these samples for elements commonly \nfound in student writing. The Learning Agency Lab (Lab) and Georgia State University \n(GSU) spearheaded the effort with support from various education-  focused organizations, \nresearchers, and practitioners.\nCreating the PERSUADE corpus involved careful consideration to ensure that it was a \nhigh-  quality resource for developing and evaluating AWE systems. The project’s first phase \ninvolved collecting student writing samples from educational organizations, including \ngovernment agencies and digital learning platforms. The team gathered nearly 400,000  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 3 ---\nAdvances in Automating Feedback for Argumentative Writing\n305argumentative essays during the initial data collection before curating them to a final \nsample of approximately 26,000. The team considered several factors during this curation \nprocess. For instance, it was important for the prompts to be diverse enough to avoid algo -\nrithmic bias toward any particular type of essay, so the team selected 15 prompts for the \nfinal corpus. The essays were collected from various organizations in different school years \nand contexts, such as annual statewide standardized exams and in-  classroom formative \nassessments. These differences in context are an advantage of the dataset as they ensure the \nalgorithms are more generalizable to various learning contexts.\nThe essays in the final corpus were also distinguished by two types of argumentative \nwriting tasks: text-  dependent writing and independent writing. Each writing task was \nequally represented in the corpus. The text-  dependent writing tasks required students to \nconstruct an argumentative essay responding to a reading passage. On the other hand, the \nindependent writing tasks required students to develop an argument without referencing \nor citing any source material. The independent writing essay topics were often related to \nschool or adolescent experiences, such as whether cell phones should be allowed in school. \nThe reading sources for the text-  dependent writing tasks were diverse in genre, length, and \nreading difficulty level.\nAdditionally, the project focused on equity, which compelled curating a data sample \nwith an adequate representation of different United States (US) student populations. The \nmajority of the essays sampled included detailed demographic information on the student \nwriters, including their reported gender, race, ethnicity, English language learner (ELL) \nstatus, participation in an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or 504 plan, and economic \nindicators like eligibility for government assistance or school lunch programs. To ensure \nsufficient representation of historically underrepresented groups, the corpus includes many \nessays from racial minority groups in the US, with 55% of all essays coming from nonwhite \nstudents.\nThe decision to oversample minority students is rooted in present-  day disparities in \nwriting performance across minority subgroups in the US. These achievement gaps are evi -\ndent in national data, such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( National \nCenter for Education Statistics, 2012 ), which finds that less than one-  third of high school \nseniors are proficient writers, but this percentage lowers to 15% for Black, Hispanic, \nand ELL students. Choosing a representative sampling approach would carry the risk \nof underrepresenting minority subgroups in terms  of quality writing samples and over-  \nrepresenting examples of poor-  quality writing. Given that minority students constitute a \nsmaller share of the population, their sample sizes are small in terms of the overall dataset \nand examples of high-  quality writing within that subset would be lower than those found \nin the overall population. On the other hand, oversampling minority groups enables the \ncollection of more instances of high-  quality writing from minority students. This, in turn, \nresults in a more diverse dataset encompassing greater variation in student writing and \nquality that should result in less biased AI models of writing proficiency.\nThe sample is also representative based on economic background because the sample  \nstatistics were aligned with national averages using data from the National Center for  \nEducation Statistics as a benchmark. Additionally, the corpus reflects writing from 6th  \nthrough 12th grade students. Thus, the corpus is robust enough to perform exploratory  \nanalysis of student writing among different demographic groups and age groups and study  \nfairness and bias in machine learning algorithms developed from the corpus. Descriptive    \n\n--- Page 4 ---\nPerpetual Baffour and Scott Crossley\n306statistics for demographic and individual differences in the PERSUADE corpus are presented  \nin Table 16.1 .\n16.2.1.1  Discourse Elements\nA teacher and research advisory board helped develop an annotation scheme for identifying \ndifferent elements of argumentative writing or discourse elements . Broadly, a discourse \nelement was defined as a span of text that performs a specific rhetorical or argumentative \nfunction within an essay. The rubric underwent multiple rounds of feedback to ensure \nthe annotations aligned with instructional practice. The discourse elements chosen for the \nannotation scheme come from adapted or simplified versions of the Toulmin argumentative \nframework ( Toulmin, 1958 ). The final discourse elements were:\n •Lead:  An introduction begins with a statistic, a quotation, a description, or other device \nto grab the reader’s attention and point toward the thesis.\n •Position:  An opinion or conclusion on the main question.\n •Claim : A claim that supports the position.\n •Counterclaim:  A claim that refutes another claim or gives an opposing reason to the \nposition.Table 16.1   Demographic Group Distribution in the PERSUADE \nCorpus: Sample Shares of Subgroups\nSample Share\nEconomic disadvantage\nEconomically disadvantaged 34.71%\nNot economically disadvantaged 45.59%\nInformation not available 19.7%\nRace/  ethnicity\nBlack or African American 18.40%\nHispanic/  Latino 24.21%\nWhite 45.26%\nAsian or Pacific Islander 7.56%\nTwo or more races 4.07%\nAmerican Indian or Alaskan Native 0.5%\nEnglish Language Learner status\nYes 7.60%\nNo 87.63%\nInformation not available 4.77%\nGrade Level\n6 4.5%\n8 37.53%\n9 7.90%\n10 28.54%\n11 15.41%\n12 1.71% \n \n  \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nAdvances in Automating Feedback for Argumentative Writing\n307 •Rebuttal : A claim that refutes a counterclaim.\n •Evidence:  Ideas or examples that support claims, counterclaims, rebuttals, or the \nposition.\n •Concluding Statement:  A concluding statement that restates the position and claims.\nHuman raters were tasked with identifying and annotating discourse elements within \nthe essays (or the absence of discourse elements). However, raters did not have to assign a \ndiscourse label to every span of text in an essay, so some sections were left unannotated. All \nraters had at least two years of experience in data annotation.\nThe raters also received anti-  bias training and anti-  bias strategy instruction, which \nconsisted of two main components. First, raters underwent individual preparation by \ncompleting Module 1 and Module 2 of the Implicit Bias Module Training Series (Kirwan \nInstitute, n.d.). In these modules, scorers engaged in self-  reflection and explored the crit -\nical concept of implicit bias. Key takeaways from these modules included a heightened \nawareness of unconscious biases related to gender, race, and demographics and con -\ncrete examples of how such biases could manifest in essay scoring. Additionally, scorers \nreflected on how these modules influenced their perception of training and alignment \nwhen scoring essays, emphasizing the need for vigilance in avoiding biases throughout \nthe process.\nAfter completing the modules, scorers participated in a 45-  minute group training session \nto raise awareness of various types of bias and their potential impact on scoring. The group \ntraining was meant to foster discussions on recognizing biases and their manifestations, \nbuilding upon the reflections from the individual preparation phase. Strategies to address \nbias were emphasized, focusing on adhering to the rubric and promoting ongoing reflection \nand review of bias throughout the scoring process. Ultimately, this anti-  bias training and \nstrategy instruction ensured a more equitable and unbiased approach to annotating the \nPERSUADE corpus.\nThe essays were annotated using a rigorous, double-  blind rating process with 100%  \nadjudication, such that each essay was independently reviewed by two expert raters and  \nadjudicated by a third rater. Annotators were not aware of the demographic characteristics  \nof the students. The Jaccard Index was used to assess the agreement between raters during  \nannotation, which measures the overlap between text segments marked by two raters. The  \noverall annotator agreement for each argument category was then determined using the  \nformula from Ferretti, Lewis, and Andrews-  Weckerly (2009), which calculates the per -\ncentage of agreement versus disagreement. Overall inter-  rater agreement prior to potential  \njudgments made by a third rater reported a weighted Cohen’s kappa of 0.73 ( Crossley  \net al., 2022 ), a relatively high level of agreement indicating reliability. However, agreement  \nvaried by discourse element. Table 16.2  presents the IRR for annotations on discourse  \nelement types in the PERSUADE corpus. The IRR values for Counterclaim and Rebuttal are  \nTable 16.2   IRR for Annotations on Discourse Element Type in the PERSUADE Corpus\nVariable Lead Position Claim Evidence Counterclaim Rebuttal Concluding Statement\nInter-  rater \nagreement0.774 0.751 0.628 0.804 0.393 0.349 0.839  \n\n--- Page 6 ---\nPerpetual Baffour and Scott Crossley\n308notably low. This is likely because these elements appear sparsely throughout the corpus. It  \nis important to highlight that any QWKs below 0.6 may be more indicative of noise rather  \nthan genuine signal.\nRegarding frequency, claims were the most common discourse element ( n =  82,584), \nwhile rebuttals were the least common ( n =  7,217).  A large number of segments were \nunannotated ( n =  47,410; see Figure 16.1  for details). Each essay had, on average, ten \nlabeled discourse elements, with low variation ( CV =  0.36), as shown in Figure 16.2 , indi -\ncating the annotations were precise enough to train machine learning algorithms to auto -\nmatically classify multiple argumentative components of an essay.\n16.2.1.2  Discourse Effectiveness\nThe experts who annotated the corpus for discourse elements also rated each element’s \neffectiveness in supporting the writer’s argument. These raters scored each element as \neffective, adequate, or ineffective  (see the Appendix for rubric). These annotations also \nfollowed a rigorous process of double-  blind ratings followed by 100% adjudication.\nMost discourse elements were rated as Adequate ( n =  188,607), followed by Effective \n(n =  38,672), then Ineffective ( n =  10,687), as shown in Figure 16.3 . This distribution poses \na potential limitation to the data. Specifically, the disparity in the number of examples \nacross the categories means that there are relatively few samples of ineffective and effective \nelements.\nMisalignments between the raters in segmenting argumentative and discourse elements  \nmake it difficult to calculate inter-  rater reliability (IRR). Segments with at least 50%  \noverlap between the first and second raters were examined to calculate the IRR. There were  \n159,228 overlapping elements, with approximately 120,000 rated as adequate, 32,000  \nas effective, and 6,000 as ineffective. Two statistics were computed: exact agreement and  \nFigure 16.1   Frequency of Discourse Element Types in PERSUADE Corpus. \n  \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nAdvances in Automating Feedback for Argumentative Writing\n309weighted Cohen’s kappa. The overall exact agreement for all classes was 0.718, ranging  \nbetween 0.68 and 0.81 for specific classes. Cohen’s kappa yielded low values ranging from  \n0.17 to 0.38 for specific classes. The overall Cohen’s kappa for all classes was κ =  0.316,  \nindicating a fair agreement.\nFigure 16.3   Frequency of Discourse Effectiveness Ratings.\nFigure 16.2   Frequency Distribution of Discourse Elements Per Essay in PERSUADE Corpus. \n  \n\n--- Page 8 ---\nPerpetual Baffour and Scott Crossley\n31016.2.1.3  Holistic Essay Quality\nThe expert raters also scored each essay holistically to provide an overall assessment of \nwriting quality. The scoring rubric used a 1-   to 6-  scale with interval levels, meaning that \nthe difference between each successive score (e.g., between 1 and 2 or 4 and 5) represents \na consistent measure or distance. For independent essays, raters were trained using a \nstandardized SAT holistic essay scoring rubric that focused on the effective development \nof a well-  reasoned position, critical thinking, well-  structured organization, language use, \nand strong grammatical accuracy. A slightly modified version of the same rubric was used \nfor source-  based essays. The modified rubric included wording related to the inclusion of \nsource material.  Scores follow a positively skewed or right-  skewed distribution, as shown \nin Figure 16.4 . IRR before adjudication indicated a strong agreement between the expert \nraters, with a weighted κ of 0.745 and r of 0.750.\n16.3 Feedback Prize 1.0: Evaluating Student Writing\nFrom December 2021 to July 2022, two data science competitions were launched on the \nKaggle platform to promote the release of the PERSUADE corpus and spur the devel -\nopment of new, accurate, and efficient open-  source algorithms for assisted writing feed -\nback ( Baffour et al., 2023 ). Educational data science challenges like these offer significant \nopportunities for developing algorithms that support the advancement of AWE systems \nand solve critical problems in education. These challenges bring together a diverse group \nof research experts, technical professionals, and experimental methodologists to solve \nproblems previously limited to research institutions and academics. They also promote \nFigure 16.4   Frequency of Holistic Score Ratings.\n  \n  \n\n--- Page 9 ---\nAdvances in Automating Feedback for Argumentative Writing\n311the democratization and expansion of research and development efforts by providing open \naccess to new datasets.\nThe competitions were launched because open data science competitions contribute to \nthe growth of knowledge in two important ways. First, participants in these challenges \ngain access to datasets, which they use to develop models and gain insights. Second, the \nmodels, insights, and data generated during the challenges are openly shared once the com -\npetition ends. This allows the work to continue and enables further innovation in methods \nand approaches. In the past decade, numerous data science challenges have been hosted \non platforms like Kaggle, attracting thousands of participants and generating millions of \nsubmissions across various competitions (Kaggle, 2021, 2022a, 2022b). However, educa -\ntional data science challenges are rare.\nIn the first Feedback Prize Kaggle challenge, “Evaluating Student Writing,” teams had to \nbuild a model to segment essays into smaller sections and assign the discourse element type \nlabels. Teams were evaluated for how well their predicted segments matched the segments \nannotated by human raters, using a minimum word overlap threshold of 50%.  The dataset \nwas divided into a training set and an evaluation test set using a 60–  40 split. Both sets \nwere carefully balanced to maintain similar distributions of data annotation labels, stu -\ndent demographic representation, and prompt representation. Kaggle participants were \ngranted access to a single evaluation set, and this test data was entirely unseen until the final \nevaluation. Although Kaggle participants could view their scores on a public leaderboard, \nencompassing approximately 61% of the test data, their final rankings were determined \nbased on their performance over the entire test dataset.\nIn evaluating performance, the final score was a calculation of the true positives, false \npositives, and false negatives for each class, then taking the macro F1 score across all classes. \nIf there was at least 50% word overlap between the machine-  segmented section and the \nhuman-  segmented section and a match between their discourse label, the model prediction \nwas considered correct (true positive). Any unmatched ground truths were false negatives, \nand any unmatched predictions were false positives.\nThe first-  place team’s model had a 75% accuracy rate, similar to the rate at which human \nreaders agreed on the annotations of the Feedback Prize data (73%).\n16.3.1  Architecture and Accuracy of Select Models\nOverall, the winning entries in the Feedback Prize were broadly based on ensembles of \nlarge-  scale, pre-  trained Transformers paired with custom preprocessing and post-  processing \ntechniques to improve accuracy. Transformers are a type of large language model, which \nare deep learning algorithms that can process and analyze textual data ( Vig & Belinkov, \n2019 ). Although all Transformer models are similar in functionality, they may vary in \nstructure. Thus, leveraging diverse Transformer architectures in an ensemble model helps to \nimprove the model’s overall performance, creating more accurate models that can evaluate \nthe organization and flow of an essay.\nThe top model developed by Chun Ming Lee, Udbhav Bamba, and Chris Deotte (Team  \nFeedforward) begins by breaking down input essays into tokens, the individual units or  \nbuilding blocks of the essay, and classifying them into one of the seven discourse elements or  \nlabeling them as “unknown.”  It also classifies whether each token is the beginning of a dis -\ncourse element or a subsequent token. Each of the 27 Transformer models in the ensemble  \nreturns a class probability distribution at the token level for each essay before lifting them   \n  \n\n--- Page 10 ---\nPerpetual Baffour and Scott Crossley\n312to word-  level predictions and segment-  level predictions. The word-  level predictions are  \nconverted to segment –   or discourse element-  level predictions using innovative techniques  \nsuch as weighted box fusion ( Zhang et al., 2021 ). The model’s correct segmentations over -\nlapped with the ground truths at 87%, on average, meaning the segmentations captured  \n86% of the words in the ground truth (see Figure 16.5 ). The model’s overall accuracy score  \nwas 0.740, with a range of 0.546 for Rebuttal and 0.874 for Concluding Statement (see  \nFigure 16.6 ).\nThe top model developed by Ahmet Erdem, Shujun He, and Darek Kleczek (Team \nBestoverfitting) consists of an ensemble of 12 Transformer models based on two architectures, \nDeBERTa and the Longformer. Unlike Team Feedforward’s model, this model does not \noutput segment-  level predictions directly from the Transformers. Instead, the Transformers \nuse word-  level predictions to generate “candidate segments,” potential segment boundaries \nof where a discourse element starts and ends, for each of the seven discourse elements. It \nthen trains separate machine learning models (class-  specific ensembles of Extreme Gradient \nBoosting (XGB) and Light Gradient-  Boosting (LGB) gradient boosting trees) to predict \neach candidate segment’s confidence scores or probabilities. The model then selects the \nmost likely segments as the final predictions. The model’s correct segmentations overlapped \nwith the ground truths at 82%, on average (see Figure 16.5 ). Its overall labeling accuracy \nwas 0.740, with a range of 0.554 for Rebuttal and 0.866 for Concluding Statement (see \nFigure 16.6 ).\nThe top model developed by Chen Jian (Team Tascj) uses a simpler word-  level segment  \nprediction task, predicting seven independent class probabilities (corresponding to the seven  \ndiscourse elements) and segment boundaries for each word in the essay. Once the model  \npredicts the probabilities, the next step is to use a unified confidence threshold to predict  \nFigure 16.5   Word Overlap between True Positives and Ground Truths in Segmentation for Feedback \nPrize 1.0 models. \n  \n\n--- Page 11 ---\nAdvances in Automating Feedback for Argumentative Writing\n313the segments around the words. This threshold determines whether or not to start or end a  \ndiscourse element at a particular word. This solution used an ensemble of four Transformer  \nmodels: two DeBERTA-  Large models and two DeBERTA-  xlarge models. On average, the  \nmodel’s correct segmentations overlapped with the ground truths at 87% (see Figure 16.5 ).  \nIts overall labeling accuracy was 0.732, with a range of 0.536 for Rebuttal and 0.858 for  \nConcluding Statement (see Figure 16.6 ).\nAll the algorithms utilize ensemble models, which combine the predictions of multiple \nmodels to improve performance. Some of the post-  processing techniques used by these \nalgorithms are innovative, such as using weighted box fusion and class-  specific ensembles \nof gradient-  boosting trees in the Feedforward and Bestoverfitting models.\nHowever, the Feedforward model requires a significant amount of storage, approxi -\nmately 85 GB, due to its utilization of 27 Transformer models. Similarly, the Bestoverfitting \nmodel requires around 33 GB of storage space. Regarding runtime, the Feedforward solu -\ntion has an amortized runtime of 2.94 seconds per essay using a high-  performance Graphics \nProcessing Unit (GPU), and the Bestoverfitting solution has an amortized runtime of 2.98 \nseconds per essay. Overall, both the space and runtime requirements for the Feedforward \nand Bestoverfitting models can be considered inefficient, given the large storage demands \nand relatively long processing times per essay.\nOptimizing efficiency for these algorithms is vital because it frees up computational \nresources and time for integrating other AI-  powered features in an AWE system, enhancing \nthe overall capabilities of such systems. While a 3-  second processing time per essay may \ninitially seem fast, it is just one step in the evaluation process that identifies the presence \nor absence of discourse elements. When considering the additional processing time needed \nfor subsequent algorithms that assess the quality of these discourse elements, generate \nFigure 16.6   Predictive Accuracy of Feedback Prize 1.0 Models by Discourse Type.  \n\n--- Page 12 ---\nPerpetual Baffour and Scott Crossley\n314feedback based on these ratings, and provide other user-  facing features (discussed later in \nthe chapter), it becomes evident that efficiency optimization is critical.\nThe top model developed by Team Tascj is substantially more efficient than other \nsolutions. It uses four Transformer models and requires the least amount of storage space \n(9 GB) compared to the other models. To generate segmentations and labels, the model \nuses a high-  performance GPU to have an amortized runtime of 0.72 seconds per essay. On \naverage, the model would take about an hour to analyze 5,000 essays for discourse seg -\nmentation. Although this performance may be slow for an AWE system where thousands \nof essays need to be graded quickly and accurately, it is still relatively fast and efficient \nfor many research applications or smaller-  scale platforms that require accurate discourse \nsegmentation.\nThe efficiency of the third-  place solution can be attributed to the simplicity of the model \nand the fact that segment predictions occur almost directly after the Transformer computes \noutputs, with relatively minimal post-  processing. Further optimizations are also possible. \nFor instance, the solution only runs one essay at a time, but implementing batching would \nlikely lead to substantial efficiency improvements.\n16.3.2  Overall Model Trends\nThe models reported a high degree of linear association between the model’s classification  \naccuracy and the inter-  rater agreement on that discourse label, as shown in the scatterplot  \nin Figure 16.7 . Each dot on the scatter plot corresponds to one of the three models analyzed  \nin conjunction with one of the 15 essay prompts included in the corpus. With 3 models and  \n15 distinct essay prompts in the dataset, the scatter plot encompasses 45 individual data  \nFigure 16.7   Correlation between Machine Learning Model Accuracy and Inter-  Rater Agreement for \nDiscourse Labeling by Prompt. \n  \n\n--- Page 13 ---\nAdvances in Automating Feedback for Argumentative Writing\n315points. The scatter plot displays the correlation between the classification accuracy of a  \nmachine learning model for a specific discourse label in essays from a particular prompt and  \nthe inter-  rater agreement on that discourse label in those essays. The correlation coefficient,  \nmeasured using Pearson’s r, was 0.92.\nIn simpler terms, the scatter plot demonstrates that when there is a high level of human \nagreement on classifying a discourse label in the essays, there is a correspondingly high level \nof machine accuracy on the same label. The strong correlation between inter-  rater agreement \nand model accuracy highlights the significance of the data annotation phase in developing \nhigh-  quality algorithms for an AWE system. Achieving high inter-  rater agreement will likely \nlead to high performance in subsequently trained models, but this hinges on several key \nfactors, including the quality of the human raters, comprehensive training in the scoring \nand annotation process, and rigorously addressing bias considerations.\nThis high correlation between a discourse element’s inter-  rater agreement and F1 score \nalso suggests that machine learning algorithms may struggle to identify discourse elements \nthat humans struggle to agree on. The machine learning algorithms may require additional \ntraining or refinement to perform well on elements with lower human agreement.\n16.3.3  Bias of Select Models\nThe bias assessment focused on demographic factors such as student race/  ethnicity, eco -\nnomic disadvantage, and ELL status ( Baffour et al., 2023 ). To assess bias, T-  tests and ana -\nlyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted on the average true positive rate (TPR) per  \nessay for the models. The criterion for detecting bias was a Cohen’s d with effect size of >  \n0.2, which indicates at least a weak relationship. Because of the large sample size, p- values  \nare not reliable indicators of differences, although we report them as a matter of conven -\ntion. The models demonstrated minimal bias based on these criteria with regard to demo -\ngraphic factors. Table 16.3  presents the results of T-  tests and ANOVAs, indicating that the  \nTable 16.3   True Positive Rate (TPR) by Demographic of Student Writer, \nFeedback Prize 1.0 Team Feedforward Model\nVariable N TPR SD\nELL Status\nELL 7,565 0.717 0.235\nNot ELL 81,207 0.726 0.220\nEconomic advantage\nEconomically disadvantaged 35,696 0.713 0.226\nNot economically disadvantaged 42,698 0.743 0.214\nRace/  ethnicity\nWhite 42,197 0.723 0.217\nBlack 17,060 0.722 0.228\nHispanic 23,055 0.712 0.229\nAsian 6,814 0.777 0.198\nAmerican Indian 574 0.728 0.226\nMultiple races 3,884 0.743 0.197 \n  \n\n--- Page 14 ---\nPerpetual Baffour and Scott Crossley\n316average TPR per essay for the Team Feedforward model did not exhibit significant vari -\nation based on students’ demographic factors. None of the t-  tests or ANOVA tests reported  \nany results with a p- value < 0.01 and a Cohen’s d > 0.2. For example, when comparing the  \nTPR differences between ELL and non-  ELL writing, the Team Feedforward model had a  \nTPR of 71.7% for ELL writing and 72.6% for non-  ELL writing, with a Cohen’s d of 0.103.  \nThese results suggest a negligible difference in model performance ( Baffour et al., 2023 ).\n16.4 Feedback Prize 2.0: Predicting Effective Arguments\nThe second Feedback Prize competition, “Building Effective Arguments,” built on its prede -\ncessor by tasking participants with developing models that predict the quality of argumen -\ntative elements (i.e., effective, adequate, or ineffective).\nThe competition ran separately from the first challenge because it used a smaller subset \nof the data from the first competition (around 6,900 out of the 26,000 essays, or a little \nover one quarter), which had a stronger balance of effectiveness scores (see Figure 16.8 ). \nIt also ran separately because the competition task for Feedback 1.0 was already at a high \nlevel of difficulty. This challenge also prioritized computationally efficient algorithms, with \nwinning algorithms on the inaugural “Efficiency” track demonstrating runtime perform -\nance ten times faster than solutions on the original track.\nThe competition gauged the overall accuracy of models using LogLoss, a common  \nevaluation metric that compares the accuracy of predicted probabilities with the actual  \nprobabilities. Additionally, the efficiency score considered both accuracy and inference  \nruntime, which is the time required for the model to generate predictions. Efficiency was  \ncalculated using the formula: Efficiency =   (1/ (log3–  min LogLoss)) * (LogLoss) +   (1/ 32400) *  \nRuntimeSeconds. By incorporating the LogLoss in the efficiency score formula, models with  \nbetter predictions will have a lower score, indicating higher efficiency.\nFigure 16.8   Distribution of Effectiveness Ratings in Feedback Prize 2.0 Competition Dataset. \n  \n\n--- Page 15 ---\nAdvances in Automating Feedback for Argumentative Writing\n317The efficiency score also considers the time it takes for a model to make predictions, \nwhich is important in real-  world applications where speed is critical. By including \nRuntimeSeconds in the formula, models that make predictions faster will have a lower \nscore, indicating higher efficiency. The efficiency score is normalized using a logarithmic \nscale and includes a constant value to ensure that the RuntimeSeconds component does not \ndominate the score.\n16.4.1  Architecture and Performance of Select Models\nThe first-  place Efficiency solution, developed by Philipp Singer and Yuahen Babakhin (Team \nHydrogen), used a single Transformer model, DeBerta-  V3- Large, using a novel approach \nthat involved generating pseudo-  label data from the previous Feedback competition. They \nthen combined this data with out-  of- fold pseudo-  labels for their given training data to \ncreate a larger, pseudo-  labeled dataset, which they used to train a new model without any \noriginal labels. By doing this, they could distill the knowledge from their large ensemble \ninto a single model, which performed very well. Team Hydrogen achieved a LogLoss score \nof 0.558 and an efficiency score of 1.035 on the private evaluation set. Comparatively, their \nLogLoss score for the main track solution was similar at 0.554. However, the runtime for \nthe main track model took nearly 3 hours to process around 1,600 essays. In contrast, the \nmodel in the efficiency track only required slightly over three minutes, resulting in a runtime \nof approximately 0.12 seconds per essay using a high-  performance GPU. This difference \nunderscores the importance of developing efficient machine learning models for this par -\nticular project and advancing AWE systems as a whole.\nThe second-  place Efficiency solution (Team Now You See Me) also used a single Deberta-  \nV3- Large model and pseudo-  labeling to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the model. \nPseudo-  labeling is a machine learning technique used during training that involves the auto -\nmatic generation of labels on unlabeled data, which are then combined with the existing \nlabeled dataset to create an augmented training dataset. Their LogLoss score on the private \nevaluation set was 0.563, with an efficiency score of 1.049. Their solution requires approxi -\nmately 1.8 GB of storage space and has an amortized runtime of 0.173 seconds per essay.\nUnlike Team Hydrogen and Team Now You See Me, the third-  place Efficiency solution \n(Team SKT) did not use pseudo-  labeling with hard labels but generated synthetic data with \nT5, a large language model. Their LogLoss score on the private evaluation set was 0.568, \nwith an efficiency score of 1.056 and an amortized runtime of 0.144 seconds per essay using \na high-  performance GPU.\n16.4.2  Accuracy of Select Models by Effectiveness Rating\nThe models accurately predicted discourse effectiveness but had more difficulty identifying \nineffective discourse segments. On average, the models were 75% accurate in predicting the \neffectiveness rating. However, this accuracy dropped to 44% for the ineffective discourse \nsegments, which were more likely to be predicted as adequate (see Figure 16.9 ). In contrast, \nthe models were more accurate in predicting adequate and effective discourses, with 85% \nand 75% accuracy, respectively.\nThis lower accuracy for ineffective discourse elements may be because there were fewer  \nexamples of ineffective discourses in the competition dataset ( n =  4,225). The lower accuracy  \ncould also stem from the inherently lower writing quality within these ineffective segments,   \n  \n\n--- Page 16 ---\nPerpetual Baffour and Scott Crossley\n318presenting a greater challenge for NLP models to interpret and evaluate the segments accur -\nately. Despite this, the models still performed well overall in predicting discourse effective -\nness. The accuracy of the models also varied by discourse type, with Lead, Concluding  \nStatement, and Evidence being more accurately predicted than other types.\n16.4.3  Bias of Select Models\nThe winning solutions from Feedback Prize 2.0 showed a greater degree of bias among \nfactors related to race/  ethnicity, economic status, and ELL status than Feedback Prize 1.0 \n(Baffour et al., 2023 ). For instance, the Team Hydrogen model was more accurate in iden -\ntifying discourses classified as effective in non-  ELL writing, achieving a 76% accuracy rate \ncompared to a 27% accuracy rate in ELL essays. T-  tests revealed a meaningful difference \nin the model’s average likelihood scores for effective discourses between ELL and non-  ELL \nwriting, reporting a medium effect size (Cohen’s d ~0.671). None of the other t- tests or \nANOVA tests reported any results with a p- value < 0.01 and a Cohen’s d > 0.2.  These \nfindings are presented in Tables 16.4  and 16.5.\n16.5 Leveraging the PERSUADE Corpus and Algorithms to Improve \nStudent Writing Outcomes in AWE Systems\nThe Feedback Prize project, anchored by the PERSUADE corpus, offers new pathways  \nfor automating feedback in argumentative writing at the discourse level. The PERSUADE  \ncorpus boasts over 25,000 essays annotated for argumentative elements and covers various  \nprompts, tasks, and student demographics, ensuring broad representation and minimizing  \nalgorithmic bias. Over 100,000 feedback models emerged from the open Kaggle  \ncompetitions, aiming to classify argumentative elements and rate their effectiveness using  \nFigure 16.9   Predictive Accuracy of Feedback Prize 2.0 Team Hydrogen Model by Discourse Type \nand Effectiveness Rating. \n \n  \n\n--- Page 17 ---\nAdvances in Automating Feedback for Argumentative Writing\n319advanced NLP approaches. The winning models, leveraging Transformer architectures,  \nboasted accuracies mirroring human annotators in segmenting essays and labeling dis -\ncourse components.\nDespite their high performance and efficiency, certain models, particularly in the \nFeedback Prize 2.0 competition for predicting discourse effectiveness, demonstrated bias \ntoward students’ demographics, such as the ELL status. Some of this bias can be attributed \nto limitations in the PERSUADE corpus, such as imbalances in effectiveness ratings. These \nlimitations call for cautious application in educational contexts. Additionally, the distribu -\ntion of grade representation within the PERSUADE corpus is notably skewed, with a sig -\nnificant concentration in Grades 8 and 10. Given this imbalance, further research may be \nnecessary before the associated algorithms can reliably offer grade-  level-  specific feedback \nbeyond 8th and 10th grade students. Nonetheless, the Feedback Prize project underscores \nAI and NLP’s capacity to elevate AWE systems.\n16.5.1  Potential User-  Facing Features in an AWE System\nOverall, the annotations in the PERSUADE corpus offer a comprehensive dataset that \neducators and AWE developers can utilize to gain insights into argumentative writing and Table 16.5   Summary of T-  Tests and ANOVA Results for Likelihood Scores, \nFeedback Prize 2.0 Efficiency Track Team Hydrogen\nVariable Test Type Cohen’s d p- value\nELL Status t- test 0.671 < 0.001\nEconomic advantage t- test 0.263 < 0.001\nRace/  ethnicity ANOVA 0.15 < 0.001Table 16.4   Likelihood Scores for Effective Discourses by Demographic of \nStudent Writer, Feedback Prize 2.0 Efficiency Track Team Hydrogen\nVariable N Likelihood STD\nELL Status\nELL 2,623 0.028 0.083\nNot ELL 19,853 0.246 0.321\nEconomic advantage\nEconomically disadvantaged 10,268 0.113 0.224\nNot economically disadvantaged 9,805 0.338 0.353\nRace/  ethnicity\nWhite 9,816 0.270 0.328\nBlack 4,157 0.133 0.246\nHispanic 6,218 0.149 0.261\nAsian 1,721 0.398 0.370\nAmerican Indian 179 0.096 0.176\nMultiple races 888 0.250 0.321 \n \n  \n\n--- Page 18 ---\nPerpetual Baffour and Scott Crossley\n320train algorithms for more effective feedback in AWE systems. The winning algorithms \nfrom the Feedback Prize competition series have the potential to support both students \nand teachers in various ways. Primarily, they can deliver immediate, formative feedback on \ndifferent aspects of a student’s argumentative writing. This feature is particularly valuable as \nteachers often need help finding time to provide feedback and assist students in improving \ntheir writing. Research indicates that more than 70% of educators feel overwhelmed by \ngrading and administrative tasks ( Baffour et al., 2023 ). Furthermore, teachers in low-  \nincome schools are nearly 20% more likely to report feeling burdened by routine duties \nlike grading essays ( Baffour et al., 2023 ).\nConsidering these challenges, one application of AWE systems could assist teachers \nand students in evaluating the structural elements of essays and identifying areas where \nwriting may be effective. Based on the performance of the winning algorithms in identi -\nfying “effective” versus “adequate and ineffective” argumentative elements in essays, it \nappears that the more immediate and evidence-  based application of these algorithms lies in \nassisting teachers and students in identifying the presence of effective writing versus inef -\nfective writing. The algorithms are well-  equipped to determine whether a student’s essay \nincludes a given element and whether it resembles an effective example.\nThis information can also help teachers understand individual student needs and identify \npatterns within the classroom. It can then be used to provide personalized feedback and \nguide classroom instruction. Another application involves integrating these algorithms into \ngrading tools, saving teachers’ valuable time during the grading process. Additionally, AWE \nsystems can provide real-  time formative feedback directly to students as they write. These \napplications can analyze the structural elements of their writing, estimate writing quality, \nand track progress over time. Such feedback empowers students to identify their strengths \nand weaknesses, enabling them to improve their writing skills.\n16.5.2  Supporting the Academic Growth of All Students,  \nIncluding the Historically Marginalized\nThe annotations on the effectiveness of each discourse element help teachers, students, and \nresearchers gain an in-  depth understanding of the nuances of argument development. The \ninsights gleaned from the effectiveness ratings can be used to create targeted interventions \nat the individual student level or inform broader policy changes at the population level. For \ninstance, a higher proportion of Lead and Concluding Statement elements were considered \neffective (~20% and ~18%, respectively), while a lower proportion of Position elements \nwere considered effective (~11%), indicating students may need more support crafting their \nthesis statement in comparison to rhetorical elements.\nPractitioners and policymakers can also implement targeted strategies to address the spe -\ncific needs of historically marginalized students based on the data found in the PERSUADE \ncorpus. For instance, if the data consistently reveals a significant gap in the effectiveness of \ncertain discourse elements among marginalized students, policy initiatives can be developed \nto allocate resources and support to improve performance in those areas. By recognizing \npatterns in students’ strengths and weaknesses and addressing disparities through oper -\national or policy changes, educational systems can work towards creating a more equitable \nand inclusive environment for marginalized students.\nAdditionally, although the holistic scores were not used in the Kaggle challenges, \nresearchers can use these scores to identify trends in the data and determine which aspects   \n\n--- Page 19 ---\nAdvances in Automating Feedback for Argumentative Writing\n321of the writing are most important for predicting overall essay quality. This information can \nthen be used to improve the performance of the algorithms used in an AWE system.\nBefore implementing widespread use, evaluating bias in AWE systems is crucial. The \nPERSUADE corpus highlights a challenge: when reflecting the US population accurately, \ndisparities in educational achievement can manifest as biases in datasets. Specifically, \nminority student groups are a smaller proportion of the population and traditionally \nunderperform in writing assessments. Consequently, fewer high-  quality writing samples \nfrom these populations are available, and data may show differences in scores and writing \ncharacteristics between these groups and the majority. This limited representation of \nminority writing can hinder the ability to train algorithms effectively to recognize and \nevaluate high-  quality writing from these underrepresented student populations ( Baffour \net al., 2023 ). Future efforts in developing educational NLP applications, such as Assisted \nWriting Feedback Tools, should prioritize the identification of potential biases in data, \nincluding label distribution, agreement, and demographic representation, to mitigate bias \nin algorithmic outcomes and promote fairness in these systems.\nIn summary, the annotations and effectiveness ratings provided by the PERSUADE \ncorpus not only contribute to an in-  depth understanding of argument development but \nalso enable personalized feedback and interventions for historically marginalized students. \nBy tailoring instruction to address specific areas of weakness and implementing changes \ninformed by the data, education leaders can promote educational equity, support the aca -\ndemic growth of marginalized students, and ensure that all students can master effective \npersuasive writing.\nReferences\nArroyo González, R., Fernández-  Lancho, E., & Maldonado Jurado, J.

This \npaper explores the concept of hybrid intelligence (HI), \nwhich emphasizes the synergistic collaboration be -\ntween AI and humans to optimize learning outcomes. \nDespite the potential of AI-  enhanced learning sys -\ntems, their application in a human-  AI collaboration \nsystem often fails to meet anticipated standards, and \nthere needs to be more empirical evidence showcas -\ning their effectiveness. To address this gap, this study \ninvestigates whether formative feedback in an HI \nlearning environment helps law students learn from \ntheir errors and write more structured and persuasive \nlegal texts. We conducted a field experiment in a law \ncourse to analyse the impact of formative feedback \non the exam results of 43 law students, as well as on \nthe writer (students), the writing product and the writ -\ning process. In the control group, students received \nfeedback conforming to the legal common practice, \nwhere they solved legal problems and subsequently \nreceived general feedback from a lecturer based on \na sample solution. Students in the treatment group \nwere provided with formative feedback that specifi -\ncally targeted their individual errors, thereby stimulat -\ning internal cognitive processes within the students. \nOur investigation revealed that participants who \nwere provided with formative feedback rooted in their \n\n--- Page 2 ---\n    | 651\nHYBRID INTELLIGENCE FOR LEGAL EDUCATION\nINTRODUCTION\nArtificial intelligence (AI) advancements promise to revolutionize traditional educational \nmethods by offering personalized learning experiences (Maghsudi et al., 2021 ) and improv -\ning learning outcomes (Wu & Yu, 2023 ). AI technologies, ranging from intelligent tutoring \nsystems (ITS; Wang et al., 2020 ) to adaptive learning systems (Wambsganss et al., 2021 ), \npossess the capability to process large datasets and customize educational experiences \nto meet the unique requirements of each learner. Traditionally, AI systems within the ed -\nucational sector have been oriented towards maximising the automation of student sup -\nport throughout the learning process (eg, Bredeweg & Kragten, 2022 ; Chen et al., 2020 ). \nHowever, doubts persist regarding the development of AI, capable of multitasking and solv -\ning diverse challenges simultaneously, in the foreseeable future (Russell & Norvig, 2010). \nAccordingly, the application of AI in educational contexts falls short of entirely substituting \nhuman instructors for intricate learning environments. This limitation stems, for example \nfrom AI's deficiency in emotional intelligence (Megill, 2014 ) and its inability to engage in \nflexible thinking and contextual adaptation (Marcus & Davis, 2020 ). These shortcomings be -\ncome particularly evident in tasks like guiding nuanced discussions during literature classes \nor offering feedback tailored to specific contexts (Chan & Tsi, 2023 ). Therefore, discussions \non alternative hybrid approaches, like hybrid intelligence (HI), have emerged (Bredeweg & \nKragten,  2022 ; Järvelä et al., 2023 ). HI is characterized by integrating humans and AI to \naccomplish intricate objectives, achieving outcomes that surpass what either could achieve \nindependently (Dellermann et al., 2019 ). The interaction between humans and computers \nwithin education can catalyse the emergence of a novel form of collective intelligence. This \nevolving dynamic underscores the indissoluble link between the educational advancement \nof both entities, as posited by Gavriushenko et al. ( 2020 ).\nInvestigations into the deployment of HI within educational settings reveal the effective ap -\nplicability of AI systems in enhancing learning outcomes. However, in summary, the majority \nof existing research on HI in the realm of AI-  supported education is of a theoretical nature \n(Holstein et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, there are only a few systems that have been developed \nfor and used in specific learning contexts (eg, Nguyen, Hong, et al., 2024 ; Yang et al., 2020 ), \nwith only a few empirical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of HI systems in achieving \npositive learning outcomes through field experiments (Akata et al., 2020 ). This gap is partic -\nularly notable concerning empirical research involving real-  time learning environments and \ntheir impact on students' learning outcomes. To help close the research gap, we present a errors within structured and persuasive legal writing \noutperformed the control group in producing qualita -\ntive, better legal text during an exam. Furthermore, \nthe analysed qualitative student statements also \nsuggest that formative feedback promotes students' \nself- efficacy and self-  regulated learning. Our findings \nindicate that integrating formative feedback rooted \nin individual errors enhances students' legal writing \nskills. This underscores the hybrid nature of AI, em -\npowering students to identify their errors and improve \nin a more self-  regulated manner.\nKEYWORDS\nformative feedback, hybrid intelligence, learning from errors, \nstructured persuasive writing\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n652 |   \nWEBER  et al .\nfield experiment as a longitudinal study that investigates formative feedback in a HI learning \nenvironment (Nguyen, Kremantzis, et al., 2024 ; Romero et al., 2024 ). Our understanding of \nHI revolves around systematically analysing student texts using AI-  based formative feedback. \nHuman intelligence then contextualizes the errors identified by the AI and places them in the \nrespective context (see Figure  2). To illustrate HI learning environments with formative feed -\nback in a specific learning context, we conducted a field evaluation of an innovation learning \nsystem in a law course. To assess the educational progress of law students in our HI learning Practitioner notes\nWhat is already known about this topic\n• Collaboration between humans and AI in educational settings advances learning \nmutually, fostering a unified developmental process.\n• Collaborative education models advocate leveraging human and AI strengths for \nadaptive learning.\n• Despite abundant theoretical research, empirical studies in HI remain limited. This \ngap underscores the need for more evidence-  based approaches in integrating AI \ninto educational settings.\nWhat this paper adds\n• Field experiment investigating the impact of formative feedback in a hybrid intel -\nligence learning environment based on the theory of learning from errors.\n• Comparison of a traditional legal learning environment (lecturer teaching using \nsample solutions) versus formative feedback in a hybrid intelligence learning \nenvironment.\n• Implementing formative machine learning-  based feedback supports law students \nin producing more structured and persuasive legal texts, leading to enhanced \nexam performance and higher grades.\nImplications for practice and/or policy\n• Our research contributes significantly to computer-  based education by present -\ning empirical evidence of how formative writing feedback impacts students' legal \nknowledge and skills in educational settings. This underscores the importance of \nincorporating empirical data into the development of AI-  based educational tools to \nensure their effectiveness.\n• By focusing on individual errors corrected by formative feedback, we contribute to \nthe learning from errors literature stream. This perspective offers valuable insights \ninto how such feedback can support students' writing and learning processes, fill -\ning a gap in empirical evidence.\n• Our findings demonstrate the potential impact of ML-  based learning systems, par -\nticularly in large-  scale learning environments like legal mass lectures. Formative \nwriting feedback emerges as a scalable and beneficial addition to traditional learn -\ning environments, triggering internal learning processes, fostering self-  regulated \nlearning and increasing self-  efficacy among students.\n• By demonstrating the effectiveness of formative feedback within the framework \nof HI, particularly in legal education, our research underscores the potential of \ncombining human understanding with AI-  supported feedback to enhance learning \noutcomes.\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n    | 653\nHYBRID INTELLIGENCE FOR LEGAL EDUCATION\nenvironment, we focus on their skills in structured and persuasive legal writing, which is a \nfundamental aspect of legal education (Kosse & Butle Ritchie, 2003 ). The law curricula typ -\nically require students to develop persuasive legal opinions, adhering to specific structural \nguidelines (Enqvist-  Jensen et al., 2017 ; Kosse & Butle Ritchie, 2003 ; Stuckenberg, 2020 ). \nMastery of such writing, crucial for German law programs, depends significantly on feedback \n(Narciss,  2008 , 2013 ; Shute,  2008 ). Formative feedback is a critical component of effective \nlearning and is defined as information provided to learners to change their thinking or be -\nhaviour and improve learning outcomes (Shute, 2008 ). Thus, formative feedback is a sophis -\nticated form of feedback or assessment that takes into account a detailed understanding of \nindividual learning needs and progress, for example by checking the accuracy of answers, \nexplanations, recommendations, or examples of work (Shute, 2007 ). The formative feedback \nof our novel student-  centred learning system LegalWriter draws on the theory of learning from \nerrors (Metcalfe, 2017 ), which should enable students to improve their legal texts in a self-  \nregulated manner (Bandura, 1991 ; Molenaar, 2022 ). Formative feedback is not exclusive to HI \nlearning environments, as it has been researched and applied in various educational settings \n(Fluckiger et al., 2010 ; Rochera & Espasa, 2013 ; Shute,  2008 ). With the advancement of mod -\nern information technologies, which provide numerous opportunities for enhancing formative \nfeedback in learning processes (Goldin et al., 2017 ; Whitelock, 2015 ), there is considerable \npotential for further research into its role as a distinct form of feedback in HI environments. \nHowever, the legal education sector struggles with providing such feedback due to large \nclass sizes and limited faculty availability for reviewing work (Henderson, 2003 ); therefore, \nstudents usually only receive summative feedback in the form of a grade or an assessment \ntext (Taras, 2001 ; Zekoll & Wagner, 2018). Additionally, current learning systems for improving \nlegal writing have fallen short (Beurskens, 2016 ). To tackle these issues, our paper aims to \ndeepen the understanding of how formative feedback in HI learning environments affects the \nlearning of legal writing. To this end, it addresses the following two research questions:\nRQ1:  Does formative feedback help students in a learning environment following the hy -\nbrid intelligence concept to develop structured writing skills in a persuasive legal writing \nassignment?\nRQ2:  How can error-  based learning combined with formative feedback help students in \nlegal courses learn how to write in a structured and persuasive manner?\nTo answer our research questions, we created an experimental design where we paired \nthe assessment of students' legal writing skills (RQ1) with the acquisition of qualitative in -\nsights from the students (RQ2) within the context of a field experiment.\nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\nHybrid intelligence  in educational settings\nThe concept of HI is based on the recognition that humans and computers have unique \nstrengths that, when combined in a collective intelligence, enable collaborative achievements \nthat neither could accomplish independently (Dellermann et al., 2019 ). In the context of \nhumans and AI, humans excel in intuitive, creative tasks, while machines are strong at \nrepetitive tasks and data processing (see Figure  1). Human intelligence relies on swift, \nintuitive thinking, while AI operates through logical, rule-  based processes. Despite human \nadaptability, machines often surpass human experts in predictive accuracy, particularly in \ntasks like actuarial modelling (Dellermann et al., 2019 ; Meehl, 1954 ). Expanding on this \nfoundation, Dellermann et al. ( 2019 ) introduced the concepts of AI in the loop of human \n\n--- Page 5 ---\n654 |   \nWEBER  et al .\nintelligence and human intelligence in the loop of AI to enhance understanding of the \nsynergistic advantages offered by human-  AI collaboration. In the subsequent section, we \naim to employ these concepts to show their implications for educational settings.\nIn the field of education, human intelligence also has a crucial role in the loop of enhanc -\ning the capabilities of machine learning (ML) and AI systems. For example, educators con -\ntribute to algorithm development by fine-  tuning parameters, such as adjusting the difficulty \nlevel of learning materials to match students' individual needs (Liu & Wang, 2020 ). Given FIGURE 1  Conceptualization of human-  AI collaboration in learning environments, fostering collective \nintelligence to improve learning outcomes based on Dellermann et al. ( 2019 ).\nFIGURE 2  Conceptualization of our system in a human-  AI collaboration system (Dellermann et al., 2019 ). \nThe graphic shows the intelligent system (AI) as the mediator of the problem information and the human as the \nprovider of problem-  solving capabilities (Von Hippel,  1994 ).\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n    | 655\nHYBRID INTELLIGENCE FOR LEGAL EDUCATION\nour research's foundation relies more on the integration of AI within human intelligence \nloops, we aim to delve deeper into this concept. AI serves a dual purpose in educational \nsettings: automating administrative tasks and providing personalized learning experience \n(Maghsudi et al., 2021 ). For instance, AI-  driven systems can handle routine tasks like grad -\ning assignments, freeing up teachers' time for more meaningful interactions with students \n(Matthews et al., 2012 ; Vittorini et al., 2021 ). Additionally, AI algorithms can analyse stu -\ndents' learning patterns and provide tailored recommendations for resources or study strate -\ngies. This personalized approach can enhance student engagement and learning outcomes \n(Wu & Yu, 2023 ). The emerging trend of HI in education involves integrating human and \nAI (Bredeweg & Kragten, 2022 ; Holstein et al., 2020 ; Järvelä et al., 2023 ). This approach \nis driven by the idea of harnessing the combined strengths of diverse intelligence, namely \nhuman and artificial agents, to achieve complementary goals (Dellermann et al., 2019 ). A re -\ncent study by Nguyen, Hong, et al. (2024 ) highlights how AI tools with large language models \n(LLMs) enhance human collaboration in academic writing, improving productivity, creativity \nand efficiency. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance traditional LLMs by in -\ntegrating text, images, audio and video, offering innovative learning and teaching methods. \nMLLMs can transform educational content delivery by making it more interactive and engag -\ning. For example, they can analyse scientific texts and create visual aids like diagrams or \nanimations, helping students understand complex concepts and catering to diverse learning \npreferences (Nguyen, Hong, et al., 2024 ).\nConceptualisation of  formative feedback\nWhen considering the mechanisms of technology-  mediated learning (Gupta & Bostrom, 2009 ; \nLeidner & Jarvenpaa, 1995 ), the social cognitive theory provides a well-  established frame -\nwork to explain its effectiveness. Developed by Bandura, the social cognitive theory fo -\ncuses on learning through acquiring knowledge by observing models (Bandura, 1977, 1991 ). \nBehavioural modelling, a cornerstone of this theory, has been extensively studied in the \ncontext of technology-  mediated learning and primarily involves learning through observ -\ning the actions of others (Gupta & Bostrom, 2009 , 2013 ). Bandura's theory suggests that \nbehaviour results from the interaction of self-  generated influences and external sources \n(Bandura,  1986 ). Regarding external sources, the social cognitive theory does not limit \nthese to peers and teachers but includes all external sources that model learning. These \nsources can encompass abstract curricula, video recordings and digital sources (see, eg, \nZimmerman & Schunk,  2011 ). Digital sources, particularly AI-  based learning systems, are \nwell-  suited to support learners in their learning activities (Khalil et al., 2024 ; Liao et al., 2024 ). \nAs highlighted by Zawacki-  Richter et al. ( 2019 ), AI-  based learning systems offer a wide \nrange of academic support, from assessment to providing feedback and tutoring in various \nteaching and learning environments. Formative feedback is a critical component of effec -\ntive learning and is defined as information provided to learners to change their thinking or \nbehaviour and improve learning outcomes (Shute, 2008 ). Thus, formative feedback is a so -\nphisticated form of feedback or assessment that takes into account a detailed understanding \nof individual learning needs and progress, for example by checking the accuracy of answers, \nexplanations, recommendations or examples of work. The primary aim of formative feed -\nback is to improve learners' knowledge, skills, and understanding in a specific area or gen -\neral ability (eg, problem-  solving) (Shute,  2007 ). Formative feedback is often differentiated \nfrom summative feedback in the academic literature (Harlen & James, 1997 ; Taras, 2001 ). \nResearchers suggest that formative feedback should be promoted, as it supports deep \nlearning (Higgins et al., 2002 ). On the other hand, summative feedback is provided at the \nend of a learning period, typically during final evaluations, to assess and summarize overall \n\n--- Page 7 ---\n656 |   \nWEBER  et al .\nachievement. Summative feedback is valuable as it also enhances students' ability to self- \nassess (Taras, 2001 ). While formative feedback emphasizes ongoing improvement, summa -\ntive feedback focuses on evaluating final results (Harlen & James, 1997 ).\nEnhanced by advanced technologies and analytical methods (Goldin et al., 2017 ; \nNarciss,  2008 , 2013 ; Whitelock, 2015 ), formative feedback provides context-  sensitive \nand personalized information that aids learners in improving their skills, solving problems \nand learning more effectively (Arkorful & Abaidoo, 2015 ; Narciss, 2013 ). For example, for -\nmative feedback can help students better understand certain concepts by providing de -\ntailed and tailored explanations (Shute, 2008 ). Additionally, it is crucial to customize the \nfeedback according to the individual needs and requirements of students, as well as the \ncapabilities of the available information technologies (Rodríguez-  Martínez et al., 2023 ). \nFeedback ultimately plays a central role in self-  regulated learning (Bandura, 1977 , 1991 ; \nButler & Winne, 1995 ), especially when provided through information technology (IT) or AI- \nbased learning systems (eg, Hooshyar et al., 2019 ; Liao et al., 2024 ; Sharma et al., 2024 ). \nFormative feedback as a special form, is one way to trigger self-  efficacy and better learning \noutcomes (Orsmond et al., 2002 ; Shute,  2008 ). Self-  regulated learning is a process in which \nlearners plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning activities (Clark,  2012 ). A practical appli -\ncation of formative feedback can support students as they write persuasive and structured \ntexts. This can be achieved through the use of ML and natural language processing (NLP) \nmethods. For example, ML-  based formative feedback is already being successfully imple -\nmented in various educational tasks, such as enhancing the quality of students' empathetic \npeer-  review writing (Wambsganss et al., 2020 ) or supporting students' argumentative writing \n(Wambsganss, 2021 , 2022 , 2024 ). These advanced feedback systems can analyse student \nsubmissions, provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses, and suggest specific \nimprovements, fostering better writing skills and deeper understanding.\nLearning from  individual errors through formative feedback\nThere is some evidence in prior research for the positive effects of feedback on individual \nerrors to training skills such as structured and persuasive writing (Hausman & Rhodes, 2018 ; \nKhasawneh et al., 2023 ; Metcalfe, 2017 ; Patchan & Puranik, 2016 ). According to Ericsson \net al. (1993 ), practice and application are essential in the process of learning and acquiring \nskills. This principle holds true for law students who must develop expertise in structured \nand persuasive writing by writing several legal texts throughout their academic journey. In \ntraditional lectures, students gain foundational knowledge and receive examples from their \nprofessors. However, due to the time constraints and large class sizes, formative feedback \non individual legal opinions is rare. Research indicates that repeated practice and learning \nfrom errors contribute to skill improvement and mastery (Ohlsson, 1996 ). Particularly \nfor novice students, errors are expected during the learning process. Metcalfe ( 2017 ) \nemphasizes the importance of providing formative feedback after errors to enhance the \nlearning process (Narciss, 2008 , 2013 ). In their work, Wong and Lim ( 2019 ) delineate \nthree distinct approaches to managing errors: prevention, permission, and promotion. \nThe error prevention approach involves strategies aimed at minimizing mistakes made \nby learners. Achieving this can involve structuring the learning environment to minimize \nthe occurrence of errors or providing learners with exposure to errors made by others \n(Chillarege et al., 2003 ; Potts & Shanks, 2014 ). McLaren et al. ( 2015 ) demonstrate the \npotential of problem solutions containing errors for enhancing learning outcomes through \nrecognition and correction processes. Conversely, the error permission approach permits \nlearners to make mistakes naturally, with subsequent corrective feedback addressing these \nerrors (Lorenzet et al., 2005 ; Potts & Shanks, 2014 ). The third approach, error promotion, \n\n--- Page 8 ---\n    | 657\nHYBRID INTELLIGENCE FOR LEGAL EDUCATION\nintentionally encourages learners to make errors. This can be accomplished by creating \nparticularly challenging learning conditions or designing learning tasks that prompt students \nto make specific errors (Keith et al., 2010).\nIn summary, we observe that students who are enrolled in legal courses typically receive \nsummative feedback centred around a model solution of a qualitative legal text or receive \nfeedback only in the form of a closing grade (Schwarcz & Farganis, 2017 ). This approach \ncontrasts with the potential benefits of formative feedback tailored to alter their thinking or \nbehaviour and improve learning outcomes (Shute, 2008 ). Unfortunately, the financial lim -\nitations faced by universities and educational institutions hinder the feasibility of offering \nsuch individualized feedback (Cresswell et al., 2015 ). A potential approach to tackle this \nchallenge lies in implementing AI-  based formative feedback (Narciss, 2008 , 2013 ). Yet, the \nexisting body of literature offers limited empirical substantiation for the effectiveness of ML- \ngenerated feedback grounded in the principles of learning through errors. Through this proj -\nect, we aim to contribute valuable insights into the effectiveness of AI-  powered feedback \nwithin a HI learning environment.\nMultidimensional perspective  on feedback\nAlthough the impacts of feedback on cognitive, motivational and emotional aspects can be \nclearly delineated (Ajjawi et al., 2022 ), most studies related to learning and writing systems \nadopt a linear perspective, focusing on the relationship between feedback and student \nwriting performance (Pinkwart et  al., 2008 , 2009 ; Reed et al., 2007 ). To achieve a more \nholistic understanding of the effects of formative feedback in a HI learning environment, it \nis essential to consider the quality of the entire feedback process (Henderson et al., 2019 ). \nTherefore, we focus on three central conceptualizations of writing feedback: feedback as \ninformation, feedback as an internal process, and feedback as a sociocultural interaction \n(Liu & Yu, 2022 ). This approach allows us to maintain the complexity of formative feed -\nback and its broader impact on the writer, the writing product and the writing process (Liu \n& Yu, 2022 ).\nTraditionally, feedback is seen as the provision of comments to students, often in the \nform of error corrections related to the writing product (Liu & Yu, 2022 ). It is a one-  way \nflow of information that follows an external assessment of writing performance and aims to \nprovide correct responses and flag types of errors. This approach focuses on the quality \nof feedback, taking into account elements such as content, type, timing, mode and the \nproviders, while the role of the learner is often overlooked (Hattie & Timperley, 2007 ; Liu \n& Yu, 2022 ). When feedback is approached as an internal process, the focus shifts to the \nstudent's writing process and how they interpret and use feedback (Liu & Yu, 2022 ). This \ncognitivist perspective emphasizes the internal processing of feedback information, high -\nlighting self-  efficacy and self-  regulation (Bandura,  1977 , 1991 ). Feedback helps students \nprocess evaluative information, reshaping their beliefs and mental structures, and involves \nmetacognitive operations for understanding and learning regulation. Models like the inter -\nnal comparison framework and concepts such as engagement and noticing illustrate how \nfeedback fosters cognitive responses, guiding students in knowledge construction and \nhabit formation (Nicol,  2021 ). The sociocultural perspective on feedback underscores its \ninteractive and relational aspects, framing it as a dialogic process where meaning is nego -\ntiated and understanding is co-  constructed (Carless, 2022 ). When feedback is perceived \nas a form of sociocultural interaction, it can have significant emotional, interpersonal, and \nmotivational effects, particularly when it targets the writer's personal development (Liu & \nYu, 2022 ).\n\n--- Page 9 ---\n658 |   \nWEBER  et al .\nDESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGALWRITER\nLearner interaction  in a hybrid intelligence learning environment\nOur learning system LegalWriter is based on the concept of HI, which emphasizes the com -\nbination of human intelligence and AI (see Figure  2). By highlighting errors and providing \nrecommendations, the system helps learners produce high-  quality legal opinions and obtain \nbetter exam grades. Our system thus combines human intuition and contextualization skills \nwith the analytical capabilities of AI. In doing so, the system identifies individual errors and of -\nfers formative suggestions for improvement, providing information about the problem rather \nthan solutions (Shute, 2007 ; Von Hippel, 1994 ). This means that our feedback highlights the \nproblems without providing direct solutions and encourages learners to engage in cogni -\ntive processes to find the solutions themselves (Aleven & Koedinger, 2000 ; Shute,  2007 ). \nIn contrast, systems such as Grammarly provide students with direct solutions, which can \ndiminish the hybrid nature of the learning process by making it more passive. In contrast, \nour system encourages active learning by asking students to analyse and correct their \nown errors (Metcalfe, 2017 ). In this context, AI acts as a mediator of the problem informa -\ntion, and human intelligence provides problem-  solving capabilities (Von Hippel, 1994 ) (see \nFigure  2). This approach encourages deeper engagement with the material and improves \ncritical thinking skills, as students need to understand and apply feedback to improve their \ntext. Accordingly, human intelligence can interpret the errors detected by the AI in legal texts \nand evaluate them in the context of the specific legal context and nuances. This integration \nenables learners to deepen their legal understanding and perform competent legal analysis, \nresulting in improved learning and performance (Wu & Yu, 2023 ).\nBack-  end of  the hybrid intelligence system LegalWriter\nWe designed and built LegalWriter as an ML-  based learning system that gives students \nformative feedback on their errors based on three fine-  tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder \nRepresentations from Transformers) models. The models are based on a corpus, which is \nshown in Weber et al. ( 2023 ). The three trained models allow identifying certain components \nin the students' legal texts and, based on the classification, provide formative feedback to \nthe students. In designing the system, we followed the findings of recent literature on digital \nlearning (Afrin et al., 2021 ; Cagiltay, 2006 ; Mathan & Koedinger, 2018), literature related to \nlearning from errors (eg, Metcalfe, 2017 ; Ohlsson, 1996 ; Wong & Lim, 2019 ) and formative \nfeedback (Narciss,  2008 , 2013 ), as well as the social cognitive theory of self-  regulation \n(Bandura,  1977, 1991 ; Nicol & Macfarlane-  Dick, 2006 ). We have created a web-  based ap -\nplication designed to work seamlessly on various devices. For integration into a hybrid learn -\ning framework featuring an AI system, the system is tailored to guide learners in crafting \nproficient legal texts. It facilitates the learning process by engaging learners interactively, \nwhere the AI plays a pivotal role in stimulating the learner's cognitive processes. This is \naccomplished by highlighting errors and offering suggestions for improvement rather than \nsupplying outright solutions (Molenaar, 2022 ). Here, the AI ultimately serves as a provider \nof information about errors. At the same time, the student provides the problem-  solving \nskills to resolve the errors and improve their text in a self-  regulated manner (see Figure  2). \nConsequently, the learning outcome is achieved through the dynamic interaction between \nthe AI and the learner, with the system purposefully not engineered to deliver flawless an -\nswers to the student. When utilizing the application, students are guided through its function -\nalities via intuitive buttons and checklists, allowing them to familiarize themselves with legal \nwriting principles. Our system is illustrated in Figure  3.\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n    | 659\nHYBRID INTELLIGENCE FOR LEGAL EDUCATION\nUser interaction  with LegalWriter\nWhen starting the application, the students were introduced to the main functionality of the \nsystems through the buttons “more” and to the main principles of legal writing through the \nchecklist on the system's left side. On the right side, the system displaces a feedback dash -\nboard for the learner, which gives more insights in the distribution of the text. After learners \nwrite their texts in the text editor, they can use the feedback button to get different types of \nfeedback. In the checklist, the errors detected by the model are displayed per component \nof the structured legal writing. Based on the errors, students receive different recommenda -\ntions on how the errors could be improved (Cagiltay, 2006 ) (see Figure  4). The highlighting \nis created using the three fine-  tuned BERT models (see section ‘Back-  end of the hybrid \nintelligence system LegalWriter’). In the text editor, learners are provided with highlights \nthat indicate which sentences can be allocated to specific components of structured legal \nwriting. Sentences that could not be assigned to any component of the legal writing remain \nunmarked (see Figure  4). On the right side, learners are presented with a feedback dash -\nboard. Here, students are shown the compositions of their text and receive feedback on \nhow to improve them. Furthermore, the learners are shown the persuasiveness of their text \nin the form of a bar chart. The presented value is lower the more errors occur and the more \nsentences cannot be classified into a component of structured legal writing (see Figure  4).\nMETHODS\nOverview of  the experimental measures and surveys\nTo answer the questions of whether formative feedback is effective in HI learning \nenvironments (RQ1) and what effects formative feedback has on the writer (students \nthemselves), the writing product, and the writing process (RQ2), we conducted a mixed- \nmethod field experiment at a German university. The experiment was designed to collect \nboth quantitative and qualitative data in the form of user statements. For this purpose, we FIGURE 3  Screenshot of the design of our formative feedback system, which gives formative ML-  based \nfeedback on errors. For the purpose of this publication, the interface has been translated into English.\n\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n660 |   \nWEBER  et al .\nconducted a five-  week field experiment (see Figure  5), which included a pre-  and post- \nsurvey as well as a treatment phase (see section ‘Treatment phase’) in the form of three \nwriting tasks and a pre-  and post-  test (see Table  1).\nStudents from the law course where our field experiment takes place could voluntarily \ndecide whether they wanted to participate in the field experiment. All students who wished \nto participate were informed that the experiment complied the data protection regulations of \ntheir university and had been classified as harmless by our university ethics committee.1 To \ncontinue participating in the experiment, the students received and completed a declaration \nof consent. Forty-  three students voluntarily took part in the experiment and completed it.

The students were randomly assigned to either the control or \ntreatment group; however, differences emerged as some students did not complete the final \nexam.\nPre- survey and pre-  test\nWe collected data and test randomization during the pre-  survey and the pre-  test.2 In the \npre- survey,3 we informed the students about data protection protocols and obtained their \nconsent to participate in the experiment. Additionally, we collected demographic data from \nthe students. The pre-  survey also included questions about various constructs (perception \nmeasures) to evaluate the effectiveness of the randomization. Specifically, we used the con -\nstructs of personal innovativeness in IT (Agarwal & Karahanna, 2000 ) and feedback-  seeking \nbehaviour (Ashford, 1986 ), both rated on a 7-  point Likert scale (see Table  S1). Moreover, we \nincorporated one control question and included an item to serve as a manipulation check.\nBefore the treatment phase starts, we further control for the efficacy of randomization and \nmitigate potential influences from confounding variables. Therefore, we executed a pre-  test. \nThe objective of the pre-  test was to demonstrate that students in both control and treatment \ngroups possessed similar levels of prior knowledge regarding legal writing. To achieve this, \nstudents were tasked with resolving a legal issue in the form of a legal opinion. This was \nthen assessed by a lecturer from the law lecture, where our experiment takes part using \nthe same grading criteria employed in the subsequent post-  test.4 The solution to the legal \nopinion was carried out during the kick-  off event of the legal lecture, and all students solved \nthe legal problem individually with the help of law books. The students entered the solution \ninto the system for collecting the legal texts.\nTreatment phase\nThe treatment phase lasted 3 weeks and took place as part of an extra 90-  minute course \naccompanying the lecture, in which a lecturer5 led. Each week, we asked the participants to \nsolve a legal problem in the course. Each student had 60 minutes to solve the legal problem \nand write a legal text. A translated excerpt from a typical student's legal text can be found \nin the Supplementary Material  (see Figure  S1). In each assignment, the participants are \nrequired to solve a legal problem in the form of a legal opinion. The legal opinion has to be \nwritten in the appraisal style. Since the term appraisal style is peculiar to the German legal \nlanguage, there is no direct equivalent in English. The term appraisal style is often defined \nas ‘the form and writing style of a legal opinion’ (eg, Stuckenberg, 2020 ; Weber et al., 2023 ).\nThe 43 participants of our field experiment were randomly assigned to two groups \n(see Figure  6). Participants in the control group followed traditional legal standards while \nTABLE 2  Overview of participants from the control and the treatment group.

They worked individually to solve legal problems, \nusing the necessary legal texts. After completing their legal texts, they received a sample \nsolution from the lecturer. The lecturer explained the sample solution, discussed it with \nthe group and answered any questions the students had. This part lasted 30 minutes. \nBased on the sample solution and the lecturer's explanations, the students continuously \nimproved their texts. In contrast, the treatment group worked on the legal problems using \nthe LegalWriter system (see Figure  6) and received formative feedback. This formative \nfeedback from the system is based on the theory of learning from errors. The system \nindicates to the students where problems and errors appear in their written text. Based \non this feedback, cognitive processes are triggered that activate the students' problem-  \nsolving capabilities. Thus, the students are self-  directed in recognizing and improving \ntheir errors. After the students completed their work with the system and improved their \nassessments, the texts were discussed in a group with the lecturer based on a sample \nsolution (30 minutes). This decision is based on several reasons. First, the use of AI in our \nHI learning environment is intended to complement, not replace, the role of the human \nlecturer. Second, we did not want to deprive the students in the treatment group of the \nexplanations of a human lecturer, as this would conflict with the ethical principles of our \nresearch. Third, there may be questions that the AI cannot adequately answer, requiring \nhuman intelligence. Fourth, AI can make mistakes, and lecturers are necessary to clarify \nand correct any misunderstandings that may arise.\nPost-  test and post-  survey\nThe post-  test, designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the treatments using the sys -\ntem, was administered as a final exam. Students from both groups participated in this exam, \nwhich was conducted under real conditions and was required for the successful comple -\ntion of the law course. However, the exam's evaluation did not affect the overall course \ngrade; it served as preparation for graded exams. The exam lasted 90 minutes and was \nindependently assessed by the same lecturer. The lecturer remained uninformed, about \nwhether the texts were generated by the control group or the treatment group. Additionally, \nno indicators were present that could unveil the affiliation of the texts with their respective FIGURE 6  Overview of the control and treatment group in the field experiment.\n\n\n--- Page 15 ---\n664 |   \nWEBER  et al .\ngroups. To facilitate a more comprehensive textual analysis, the instructor allocated three \ngrades, ranging from 0 to 18 points (0: indicating failure; 18: very good), to the students' as -\nsignments. This grading system adhered to German legal norms (Zekoll & Wagner, 2018); \nthe whole scale can be found in Table  S7. One grade was assigned for legal structured and \npersuasive writing, one grade for the content quality of the legal text, and one overall grade \nfor the legal text. To determine the grade for structured and persuasive legal writing, we \nresorted to the appraisal style, which is a widely used method of legal writing (Man, 2022 ; \nStuckenberg, 2020 ). Therefore, to assess whether the structure and persuasiveness of \nlegal writing had been adhered to, the lecturer needed to determine whether the com -\nponents of the appraisal style ( major claim , definition , submission , and conclusion ) had \nbeen used appropriately and whether the connections between these components had \nbeen made correctly. In addition, the lecturer had to verify the proper use of legal claims \nand premises in the subsumption process and ensure that the connections between the \ncomponents were coherent and logical. To measure the content quality of the legal text, \nthe lecturer checks if appropriate definitions and paragraphs were used and whether the \nstudent could derive a comprehensible solution to the legal problem of the hypothetical \nfacts (Zekoll & Wagner, 2018). The evaluation of the overall score for the legal text was \ncomposed of the two previously awarded grades on a percentage basis. While the struc -\ntured and persuasive legal writing contributed 30% to the total grade, the content quality of \nthe legal text held a weight of 70%. As Schröder ( 2022 ) indicates, structured and persua -\nsive writing in the appraisal style is part, of every legal exam. Nevertheless, a standardized \ncriterion for the impact of structured and persuasive writing on the final grade through the \nappraisal style is lacking. As a result, we opted to follow the lecturer's evaluation method, \nwhich involves factoring in 30% of the structured and persuasive writing grade into the \noverall final grade.6\nIn the post-  survey, we aimed to assess the perceived impact of formative feedback on \nthe students themselves, the writing product, and the writing process to answer research \nquestion 2 (RQ2) via an online survey (Braun et al., 2021 ). To achieve this, we captured the \nqualitative impressions of students in their learning processes by asking four qualitative \nquestions: “How has the system's usage and feedback influenced your learning process?”, \n“Can you share specific aspects of your interaction with LegalWriter that you enjoyed the \nmost?”, “If given the opportunity, what enhancements would you suggest for LegalWriter?” \nand “Are there any other suggestions you'd like to propose? What additional features would \nyou like to see integrated into the system?” (see Table  S2). The questions aim to provide \nmore precise qualitative insights into why formative feedback is effective in a HI learning \nenvironment. All students in the treatment group participated in the post-  survey, which was \nconducted via an online survey platform. We asked the students to answer the questions for \nat least 15 minutes ( SD = 3.12  minutes).\nRESULTS\nResults of  the pre-  survey and the pre-  test\nWe compared the mean differences of the two constructs measured in the pre-  survey \nto control for the potential impact of confounding variables given our small sample size \nand to confirm the effectiveness of randomization. No significant differences were found \nbetween the control and treatment groups in terms of personal innovativeness ( p = 0.531) \nor feedback-  seeking behaviour ( p = 0.705), indicating successful randomization. The \ncontrol group averages 3.5 ( SD = 0.55) in personal innovativeness and 6.24 ( SD = 0.49) in \nfeedback seeking. Meanwhile, the treatment group averages 3.37 ( SD = 0.71) for personal \n\n--- Page 16 ---\n    | 665\nHYBRID INTELLIGENCE FOR LEGAL EDUCATION\ninnovativeness and 6.18 ( SD = 0.47) for feedback seeking. The specific items used for these \nmeasurements are provided in Table  S1.\nIn addition to the two measurements, participants were asked to solve a legal problem \nin the post-  test. This allowed us to determine whether the two groups' abilities to write legal \ntexts differed. Our analysis, conducted via a two-  tailed t-  test comparing the control and treat -\nment groups, yielded p- values exceeding 0.05 for all measured variables (see Table  S12). \nConsequently, examination of three distinct grading criteria—structured and persuasive \nwriting, content quality and overall grade of the legal text—revealed no significant dispari -\nties in mean values between the control and treatment groups. This suggests a comparable \nbaseline level of prior legal writing knowledge across both groups (see Table  S12).7\nImpact on quality of legal writing\nWe start by presenting the results related to our first research question: Does formative \nfeedback help students in a learning environment following the hybrid intelligence concept \nto develop structured writing skills in a persuasive legal writing assignment? To investigate \nRQ1, we specifically tried to validate whether formative feedback from a learning system, \ncompared to feedback from a lecturer based on an example solution, helps students to write \nbetter structured and persuasive legal texts. To answer RQ1, we compared the grades of \nthe written exams of the control group and the treatment group. We used a one-  tailed t-  test \nto check for significance between the variables of structured and persuasive writing quality, \nthe content quality of legal writing, and the overall grade. To ensure that the assumptions \nfor the one-  tailed t-  test are met, we conducted statistical and visual tests for normality and \nhomogeneity of variance (for more detail, see Tables  S4–S6 ). All assumptions were met \nfor all variables. More specifically, we conducted a Shapiro–Wilk test to test the normality \nassumptions (see Tables  S8–S10 ), and a Levene's test to check for the homogeneity of \nvariance assumption (see Table  S11). Q-  Q plots graphically supported the results of the \nShapiro–Wilk test.\nWe analysed the quality of legal writing to gain insights into the students' structured and \npersuasive writing. The assessment involved a comparison between the appraisal styles \nof the control group and the treatment group. The assigned scores for the quality of the \nappraisal style served as the basis for this comparison, with Figure  7 depicting the data dis -\ntribution through boxplots. The control group is represented on the left, while the treatment \ngroup is on the right. Notably, the interquartile ranges reveal a more extensive score distri -\nbution in the treatment group. Red points are used to highlight mean values for better visu -\nalization. The control group has a median score of 8, and the treatment group has a median \nscore of 12 (refer to Table  3). Examining Table  3, we observe that the mean score for the \ntreatment group (mean  = 11.08**, SD = 2.19) exceeds that of the control group (mean = 8.84, \nSD = 2.59). By conducting a t - test, we found a statistically significant difference between the \ncontrol and treatment groups ( p = 0.002). Furthermore, the effect size analysis indicates a \nlarge effect ( d = 0.95) (Cohen,  1992 ), suggesting that the treatment appears to be effective.\nThe assigned scores for the content qualitative legal writing served as the basis for this \ncomparison, with Figure  8 depicting the data distribution through boxplots. The control group \nis represented on the left, while the treatment group is on the right. Notably, the interquartile \nranges reveal a slightly extensive score distribution in the treatment group. Red points are \nused to highlight mean values for better visualization. For the content qualitative legal writ -\ning, the control group shows a mean of 5.53 (median = 6), and the treatment group shows \na mean of 6.58 (median = 7). We did not find a statistically significant difference between \nthe two groups; accordingly, no effect size was calculated. In Figure  8 also, the assigned \nscores for the total grade of the legal text are shown as boxplots. The interquartile ranges \n\n--- Page 17 ---\n666 |   \nWEBER  et al .\nreveal a higher score distribution in the treatment group. The analysis of the total grade of \nthe legal text shows a mean of 6.53 (median = 6) in the control group and a mean of 7.75* \n(median  = 8) in the treatment group.8 We observed a significant difference with a p - value of \n0.035. Further examination of the effect sizes indicates a medium effect ( d = 0.57).\nImpact on the writer, the writing product and the writing process\nSince our findings on RQ1 lead us to assume formative feedback helps students write better \nstructured and persuasive legal texts, we aimed to investigate further our RQ2 about how FIGURE 7  Data distribution of scores for structured and persuasive writing grades.

To obtain deeper insights into \nthe observed effect and the mechanisms of formative feedback on errors in an HI learning \nenvironment.\nFor this purpose, we evaluated qualitative students' statements concerning their learn -\ning process; the corresponding questions are shown in the Supplementary Material  (see \nTable  S2). We analysed the students' qualitative answers concerning their perception of \nthe learning process with the system. We identified three main themes among participants' \nresponses based on Liu and Yu ( 2022 ) framework for adopting feedback in the learning \nprocess. These are the topics of (1) feedback as information, (2) feedback as sociocultural \ninteraction and (3) feedback as an internal process. The three characteristics help us better \nrecognize to what extent the formative feedback impacts the writing product (legal text), the \nwriter and the writing process Liu and Yu ( 2022 ). We briefly present the highlights and elab -\norate on them in the discussion.\nFeedback as information : Across all responses, there were positive comments about the \ndifferent feedback channels and how they were embedded in students' learning processes. \nThus, 74% of the students positively highlighted the informational content of the feedback. \nMost frequently, students mentioned the positive information content of the highlights in the \ntext, which helped students identify which sentences do not fit the structure of legal writ -\ning. Interestingly, many students had positive remarks about the dashboard, particularly the \npersuasion bar, often mentioned as ‘the best thing was the feedback on persuasion’. Some \nstudents also appreciated the chart showing the composition of components in the text, \nsaying, ‘because of the chart, I was able to adjust the weighting of my text well’. Feedback \nin the checklist, which provided recommendations for improving the texts, was mentioned \nless frequently. Due to, a student stated, ‘thanks to the comments, I have seen better where \nI have made mistakes and where I need to correct them’. Furthermore, students positively \nmentioned the direct timing of the feedback. Thus, an above-  average number of students \nappreciate the direct feedback provided by the system: ‘I get very fast and detailed feedback \non everything I write. LegalWriter allows me to identify and correct my writing mistakes \nimmediately’. Based on the comments, we can conclude that the information content of for -\nmative feedback helps students improve their texts, especially concerning adherence to the \nstructure and composition of the text. The formative feedback, therefore, directly affects the \nstudents' writing, that is the writing product, which follows Liu and Yu ( 2022 ) explanations.\nFeedback as sociocultural interaction : When feedback operates as a sociocultural in -\nteraction, it can have emotional, interpersonal, and motivational effects, influencing the \ndynamic nature of teaching and learning both in and outside the classroom. As a social ar -\ntefact, learning emotion involves students interpreting feedback within the specific context in \nwhich it is given (Liu & Yu, 2022 ). In our qualitative evaluation, students primarily perceived \nfeedback as a sociocultural interaction regarding trust and accuracy towards the system. \nThe formative feedback seemed to inspire confidence among the students: ‘The accuracy \nof the system and therefore the trust in a quick and thorough review of my work’. Another \nstudent mentioned, ‘I had more trust to start writing freely and focus on structuring afterward \nsince the program pointed out all the errors’. Overall, trust appears to be triggered by forma -\ntive feedback, which positively influences the learner's acceptance of an AI-  based learning \nsystem (Ghazizadeh et al., 2012 ; Parasuraman & Wickens, 2017 ).\nFeedback as an internal process : In terms of the internal processes that the feedback \ntriggered in the student's learning process, the main themes addressed were self-  efficacy \n(Bandura,  1977 ) and self-  regulation (Bandura, 1991 ; Molenaar, 2022 ) in writing. Students \nindicated, ‘I receive quick and detailed feedback on everything I write. LegalWriter helps me \nidentify mistakes in my writing and I was able to correct my errors immediately’. Furthermore, \nstudents noted, ‘that you can generally improve your appraisal technique and feel more \n\n--- Page 20 ---\n    | 669\nHYBRID INTELLIGENCE FOR LEGAL EDUCATION\ncourageous with the writing style as a result’. Regarding self-  regulated learning, students \nindicated: ‘I saw what I need to improve. So, in the following cases, I was able to work out the \nthings I had neglected before’ and ‘Using and receiving feedback from this system has been \nvery effective for me. The feedback has helped me better identify where I made mistakes \nand where I need to correct them’. The statements from the students suggest that, based on \nthe formative feedback, their writing process evolved into a more self-  regulated approach.\nDISCUSSION\nOur study aimed to examine the impact of formative feedback on law students' structured \nand persuasive writing skills, as well as its influence on the writing product (legal text), the \nwriter and the writing process. The results indicated that students who received formative \nfeedback from a learning system in an HI learning environment demonstrated significant \nimprovements in their ability to write legal texts. This finding supports our initial assumption \nthat formative feedback in a HI learning environment is more effective than general feedback \nprovided by a lecturer after a writing task, as formative feedback is tailored to each student's \nneeds. Therefore, we can conclude that formative feedback, which is based on individual \nerrors, plays a crucial role in supporting students in a writing environment that is guided by \nAI. Both quantitative and qualitative data obtained from a field experiment corroborate these \nconclusions.\nThe quantitative analysis of our data shows that the students who worked with formative \nfeedback received better grades in structured and persuasive legal writing than students \nwho received only general human feedback based on a case study in traditionally designed \ntutorials. Thus, we might indicate in our context that formative feedback supports students' \nlearning processes better than the common practice in legal teaching. Furthermore, we \ncan also show that the overall grade of students in an exam is higher for those who worked \nwith formative feedback in a legal lecture. This result should be interpreted in the context \nthat 30% of the overall grade depends on the quality of structured and persuasive writing \nin the appraisal style. However, no further assumptions could be made, as we could not \ndemonstrate any significant differences in the grade for the content components of a law \nexam between the two groups. Since the system in its current version can only train legal \nwriting style, the result is unsurprising and even tends to confirm its specific effect size (eg, \nTable  3). The analysis of our qualitative study further demonstrates that formative AI-  based \nfeedback in a HI learning environment significantly supports students' writing product, the \nwriting process and the writer itself. Students perceived the formative feedback provided \nby the learning system as a valuable information source, offering immediate guidance for \nimproving the content and structure of their texts. Moreover, the feedback's influence on \nthe learners became evident, as students trusted the formative feedback in these HI envi -\nronments, specifically mentioning the feedback generated by the system. Future research \ncould explore whether students would continue to trust system-  generated feedback if it \nwere not followed by a lecturer's explanation of a sample solution. Conducting further focus \ngroup interviews could provide deeper insights into this question. Additionally, our qualita -\ntive analysis revealed that the feedback initiated self-  regulation processes, as described \nby Bandura (1991 ). This supports and extends previous findings in this field (eg, Persico \n& Steffens, 2017 ; van Alten et al., 2020 ), by showing that formative AI-  based feedback \nalso promotes self-  regulated learning. Intelligent systems can thus serve as tools through \nwhich students evaluate their progress and reflect on internal benchmarks and standards. \nSystems like these are particularly good at recognizing errors or misunderstandings in stu -\ndents' tasks better than their peers or the students themselves. Consequently, the feed -\nback that these systems provide can significantly support students to use their human skills \n\n--- Page 21 ---\n670 |   \nWEBER  et al .\nin the conceptualization and problem-  solving and to act in terms of collective intelligence \n(Dellermann et al., 2019 ). When combined with the results of the quantitative evaluation, our \nstudy's findings align with existing research, instilling confidence in the validity of our work. \nIt appears that the writing process, driven by enhanced self-  regulation among students, is a \nkey factor contributing to the measured learning success in terms of structured and persua -\nsive writing grades and the overall grade of the legal text. These findings align with research \non learning from errors (Metcalfe, 2017 ) and formative feedback (Hattie & Timperley, 2007 ; \nMathan & Koedinger, 2018).\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that intelligent learning systems can effectively train struc -\ntured and persuasive legal writing. Traditional systems in the domain of persuasive legal \nwriting have primarily focused on using examples (Aleven, 2003 ) or highlighting structures in \ntexts to improve writing (Pinkwart et al., 2008 , 2009 ; Reed et al., 2007 ). However, our study \nshows how formative feedback can support students in structured and persuasive writing, \nenhancing their learning process. This builds on current studies exploring AI in HI learning \nenvironments (Järvelä et al., 2023 ; Nguyen, Kremantzis, et al., 2024 ; Romero et al., 2024 ) \nand adds to the literature by illustrating the long-  term impacts of formative feedback in HI \nenvironments through a practical field experiment.\nOur research offers five valuable contributions to the exploration of how formative feed -\nback in HI learning environments can improve education. First, we make a noteworthy \ncontribution to the field of technology-  mediated learning by presenting empirical evidence \nregarding the impact of formative writing feedback on the advancement of students' legal \nknowledge and skills in educational settings. Second, we contribute, in particular, to the \nlearning from errors literature stream by providing a nuanced perspective on how individual \nerrors corrected by formative feedback can support students in their writing and learn -\ning processes. To the best of our knowledge, empirical evidence for formative feedback \nbased on individual errors is still limited in this area. Third, we contribute to technology-  \nmediated learning by showing that interactions with ML-  based learning systems in a spe -\ncific writing environment have the potential to impact students' learning processes (Gupta \n& Bostrom, 2009 , 2013 ). Especially in large-  scale learning environments such as legal \nmass lectures, formative writing feedback could be a scalable and beneficial addition to \ntraditional learning environments. The qualitative results indicate that this new technology \nmight be able to trigger internal processes in the learning process of students. Thus, forma -\ntive feedback seems to trigger self-  regulated learning and leads to increased self-  efficacy \nin students. Fourth, our experiments provide empirical evidence that formative feedback \nwithin the framework of a HI approach, such as in legal education, can be effective. Through \nthe integration of formative feedback, we observed enhancements in participants' learning \nprocesses and learning outcomes. In our research, directly addressing individual errors \nand providing feedback based on this approach resulted in a significant enhancement in \nthe examination outcomes of students who engaged with our AI system. These findings \noffer tangible indications that the combination of human understanding and AI-  supported \nfeedback represents a promising approach to enhance learning outcomes in legal educa -\ntion and further strengthen the HI paradigm (Dellermann et al., 2019 ; Holstein et al., 2020 ). \nFinally, our extends on existing studies exploring the intersection of AI and education, \nadvancing the development of formative learning systems that can more deeply person -\nalize the learning experience (Järvelä et al., 2023 ; Nguyen, Kremantzis, et al., 2024 ). This \ninvolves not only adjusting task difficulty based on student performance but also integrating \nformative feedback. Additionally, we examine the long-  term effects of artificial intelligence \non student learning outcomes in the form of exam grades. Through our longitudinal studies, \nwe track the impact of AI integration over extended periods, providing a more comprehen -\nsive and nuanced understanding of how continuous interaction with AI technologies influ -\nences HI learning environments (Nguyen, Kremantzis, et al., 2024 ; Romero et al., 2024 ).\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n    | 671\nHYBRID INTELLIGENCE FOR LEGAL EDUCATION\nLIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nIn respect to our work, some limitations must be mentioned. First, the field experiment was \nlimited in terms of sample size ( n = 43). Further empirical analysis is needed to replicate the \nresults presented. However, we assume that the effects shown are more replaceable, as we \nshowed high effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.95) for, among others, the quality of structuring and \npersuasive legal writing. The effect sizes suggest a specific effect of formative feedback. \nSecond, we conducted a qualitative online survey, which provided preliminary insights into \nstudents' perceptions of AI-  based formative feedback in HI learning environments. These \ninsights particularly pertain to the feedback's impact on the writing product, the writer, and \nthe overall writing process. However, further research is necessary to delve deeper into the \nreasons behind the students' sense of trust when interacting with the system. Additional \nfocus group interviews could be valuable for a more comprehensive understanding of the \nsystem's effectiveness and for exploring aspects such as trust in HI learning environments. \nThird, we want to highlight the ethical limitations of our study. Concerning the integration of \nformative feedback within an educational system, our intention is by no means to replace \nhuman educators. We firmly believe proficient teachers will consistently excel in offering \npersonalized writing feedback compared to any algorithm. Nevertheless, we aspire for our \nsystem to assist human educators in allocating additional time and attention towards ad -\ndressing intricate inquiries and challenging instances.\nIn summary, our objective is to offer valuable insights into the design of learner-  centred \napproaches to enhance educational applications by integrating cutting-  edge computational \ntechniques in legal pedagogy. We aspire to catalyse the progress of NLP and ML, inspiring \nresearchers to conceive more educational systems tailored to the specific demands of legal \neducation. By doing so, we anticipate making a tangible impact on the advancement of legal \neducation, particularly in cultivating proficient writing skills.\nCONCLUSION\nIn our project, we addressed two research questions. Initially, we examined whether imple -\nmenting formative feedback, rooted in students' errors, enhances their proficiency in con -\nstructing well-  structured and persuasively argued legal texts. Through a field experiment at \na German university, we observed a positive correlation between the provision of formative \nfeedback and advancements in students' legal writing skills. Subsequently, we delved into \nthe influence of error-  based formative feedback on the writing product, the writer and the \nwriting process. As a result of using this form of feedback, students reported heightened \nlevels of self-  regulated learning and increased self-  efficacy in their writing skills.\nIn conclusion, our study provides solid empirical evidence regarding the effectiveness of \nML- based formative feedback in the domain of legal writing. Moreover, our empirical results \nemphasize the efficacy of the fusion of human and AI capabilities in the learning process. \nThey accentuate the additional value AI can contribute to education, particularly within a \nlearning environment, adhering to the HI framework.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nOpen Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.\nFUNDING INFORMATION\nThe results presented in this paper were developed in the research project Komp-  HI funded \nby the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, grant 16DHBKI073).\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n672 |   \nWEBER  et al .\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\nThe authors state no conflict of interest.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe data that supports the findings of this study are available in the supplementary material \nof this paper.\nETHICS STATEMENT\nIn this study, we made it a top priority to protect participants' rights and maintain the re -\nsearch's integrity.

Its goals are to identify argumentation in text or dialogue; to construct\nrepresentations of the constellation of claims, supporting and attacking moves (in diﬀerent levels\nof detail); and to characterize the patterns of reasoning that appear to license the argumentation.\nFurthermore, recent work also addresses the diﬃcult tasks of evaluating the persuasiveness and\nquality of arguments. Some of the linguistic genres that are being studied include legal text,\nstudentessays,politicaldiscourseanddebate,newspapereditorials,scientiﬁcwriting,andothers.\nThe book starts with a discussion of the linguistic perspective, characteristics of argumen-\ntative language, and their relationship to certain other notions such as subjectivity.\nBesides the connection to linguistics, argumentation has for a long time been a topic in\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence, where the focus is on devising adequate representations and reasoning\nformalisms that capture the properties of argumentative exchange. It is generally very diﬃcult\nto connect the two realms of reasoning and text analysis, but we are convinced that it should be\nattempted in the long term, and therefore we also touch upon some fundamentals of reasoning\napproaches.\nThen the book turns to its focus, the computational side of mining argumentation in text.\nWe ﬁrst introduce a number of annotated corpora that have been used in the research. From the\nNLP perspective, argumentation mining shares subtasks with research ﬁelds such as subjectiv-\nity and sentiment analysis, semantic relation extraction, and discourse parsing. Therefore, many\ntechnical approaches are being borrowed from those (and other) ﬁelds. We break argumentation\nmining into a series of subtasks, starting with the preparatory steps of classifying text as argu-\nmentative (or not) and segmenting it into elementary units. Then, central steps are the automatic\nidentiﬁcation of claims, and ﬁnding statements that support or oppose the claim. For certain\napplications, it is also of interest to compute a full structure of an argumentative constellation\nof statements.\nNext, we discuss a few steps that try to ‘dig deeper’: to infer the underlying reasoning\npattern for a textual argument, to reconstruct unstated premises (so-called ‘enthymemes’), and\nto evaluate the quality of the argumentation. We also take a brief look at ‘the other side’ of\nmining, i.e., the generation or synthesis of argumentative text.\nThebookﬁnisheswithasummaryoftheargumentationminingtasks,asketchofpotential\napplications, and a—necessarily subjective—outlook for the ﬁeld.\nKEYWORDS\nargumentation mining, natural language

researchers interested in contributing to the ﬁeld\nof argumentation mining, a fast-growing ﬁeld at the intersection of human language technolo-\ngies and computational argumentation. The book’s purpose is to spread existing concepts and\nmethods about argumentation mining widely, providing background about argumentation and\na snapshot of the current state of this burgeoning ﬁeld. As part of the Synthesis Lectures on\nHLT series, this book is directed primarily at the natural language processing and computational\nlinguistics community. A secondary audience is the broader computational argumentation com-\nmunity. Growing the common ground between these complementary realms will, we believe,\ndrive further progress in the ﬁeld.\nThe book focuses on key background, current approaches, and possible future directions.\nIt describes existing models, corpora, and annotation schemes that researchers everywhere can\nreuse in building their own systems. It structures the overall problem of argumentation min-\ning into a number of subtasks used to mine arguments from written documents. Given the\nprimary target audience stated above, we assume a basic knowledge of natural language pro-\ncessing (NLP), as it can be obtained for example from Jurafsky and Martin [2009] and Clark\net al.[2013]. Conversely, for readers coming from an NLP background who would like to study\nsome argumentation literature, good starting points include van Eemeren et al. [2014] and Ba-\nroni et al. [2018].\nOur aim is to give a representative review of progress and challenges in the ﬁeld, as of\nlate 2017 and early 2018. We have focused on capturing work presented on the one hand in\nthe international Computational Linguistics literature—conferences such as ACL, COLING,\nEMNLP, and LREC; workshops such as SemDial and the Argument(ation) Mining series;\njournals such as Computational Linguistics andTransactions of the Association for Computational\nLinguistics —and on the other hand (to a somewhat smaller extent) at computational argumen-\ntation venues such as the COMMA conference, the CMNA workshop, or the Argumentation\n& Computation journal. Argumentation is also studied in the wider artiﬁcial intelligence com-\nmunity, which is however beyond our scope, as are a number of speciﬁc tasks such as political\nideology detection. On the whole, unsurprisingly, our choice of literature is inﬂuenced by our\nown past work and the community with which we have interacted.\nWe hope that parts of this book quickly become obsolete due to new results, new knowl-\nedge, new approaches, and more synthesis. At the same time, it would be nice if the role of a\n\n--- Page 14 ---\nxiv PREFACE\ngentle introduction to the nature of the ﬁeld and its manifold aspects worked for a number of\nyears.

This is supplemented by outlining further central aspects\nof argumentation, viz. the dimensions of logos, ethos, and pathos, and the concept of the ‘criti-\ncal discussion’ as a fundamental idealized context for activities of arguing. We then move to the\napplied side of computational linguistics, and provide a deﬁnition of argumentation mining in\nSection 1.2, followed by an outline of reasons for studying automatic argumentation mining in\nSection 1.3. We ﬁnish the chapter by explaining the structure of the book in Section 1.4.\n1.1 ARGUMENTS AND ARGUING\n1.1.1 A DEFINITION\nArgumentation (as an activity of human beings seeking to sort out their conﬂicting views) has\nbeen of interest to philosophers for a long time, with the best-known of the traditional work\nbeing that of Aristotle. In his Rhetorics, he sought to develop a general theory of persuasion and\napplied it to three types of speeches: the deliberative speech, which advises on a course of future\naction; the judicial speech, which accuses or defends someone whose past activities are to be\njudged; and the epideictic speech, which praises or blames a person of public interest. As the\nconcrete starting point for our introduction, however, we selected a deﬁnition proposed in much\nmore recent work by van Eemeren and Grootendorst [2004, p. 1]:\n“Argumentation is a verbal, social, and rational activity aimed at convincing a rea-\nsonable critic of the acceptability of a standpoint by putting forward a constellation\nof propositions justifying or refuting the proposition expressed in the standpoint.”\nThe main elegance of this deﬁnition is in its bringing together the range of crucial aspects in a\nrather compact form (a single sentence). Let us consider each aspect in a little more detail.\nA verbal activity. People can and do gesture and frown at each other, and occasionally this\nmight be a way of resolving some disagreement. In our conception here, however, argumentation\nis an inherently linguistic activity—either in spoken or written mode. This is to be distinguished\nfrom, for instance, a ﬁstﬁght, which can be a diﬀerent means of sorting out a conﬂict.\nA social activity. Socialemphasizes that argumentation is a matter of interaction among a\nnumber of people, with a minimum of two. Granted, many of us munch on a diﬃcult decision\n\n--- Page 17 ---\n2 1. INTRODUCTION\nfor some time by mentally walking through the consequences of the alternatives, but genuine\narguing requires a person to argue with.\nA rational activity. Obviously, we can perform verbal and social activities in very many ways.\nAmong these, argumentation targets speciﬁcally the dimension of reason. When one person\nreminds the other “Be reasonable!”, the point is to call for a style of dialogue that is not driven\nby emotional outbreak, power struggle, personal oﬀense, etc., but by the sober exchange of—\nreasonable arguments.\nA standpoint. In argumentation, the heart of the matter is some issue on which people may\nhave divergent views. Thus, the argument does not target an undisputed ‘fact’ but a ‘standpoint’\n(or a ‘stance’). Where there is no potential disagreement, there is no need to argue.\nConvincing of acceptability. At the end of an argument, the parties involved may not nec-\nessarily be completely ‘on the same page’ about the standpoint. An argument (usually) does not\nprove beyond any doubt that one particular viewpoint is the single correct one. Instead, the party\nwho initially was skeptical may now be somewhat more inclined to accept the view of the other\nparty (if the argument was successful).\nA constellation of propositions. The shape of a justiﬁcation might be quite simple, for in-\nstance a single convincing sentence. But quite often it will be more complex and involve a web\nof interrelated points that the speaker carefully assembles in a non-arbitrary way; an example of\nsuch a constellation will be shown at the end of this section.\nJustifyingthepropositionofthestandpoint. If the reader is more inclined to accept the par-\nticular standpoint after the argument is ﬁnished, that result is not just due to the speaker having\npointed out that he is the boss, or some such; it is due to the speaker having successfully justiﬁed\ntheir view.1\nA reasonable critic. This phrase in fact combines two distinct aspects. Reasonable reinforces\nthe point made earlier by the ‘rational activity’: the argument is subject to scrutiny on the level\nof rational thought. But in addition, the presence of the external criticpoints to a social context\nin which the argumentation takes place. This can be common political discourse for which most\npeople have the background, or it can be a much more specialized realm such as the scientiﬁc,\nmedical, or legal. Whatever the context, it includes particular rules of conduct that have become\nconvention, which the implicit judge of the argument watches over.\nAs an illustration for the theoretical considerations given so far, here is an example from\nthe corpus of ‘argumentative microtexts’ [Peldszus and Stede, 2016b]:\n1The proviso (given in the quotation from van Eemeren and Grootendorst) that the goal can also be to refutethe proposition\nrefers merely to the situation where said standpoint is about notbelieving something or doing something.\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n1.1. ARGUMENTS AND ARGUING 3\n(1.1) Some may ﬁnd the idea of a school uniform anachronistic, or regard it as too much of an\nintervention into the leeway of students and parents to make decisions. Indeed, however,\nit’s already the case today that students of apparently ‘uniform-free’ schools are essentially\nwearing a uniform consisting of certain brand-name garments. A simply designed\npractical outﬁt would even out the overall visual image of a school, and direct attention\ntoward the character and achievements of the students—and not their buying power.\n(micro-b012.txt)\nThis text was written in response to the trigger question “Should students wear school uni-\nforms?”, and thus the controversial standpoint defended here is “Students should wear school\nuniforms at school”. Incidentally, this standpoint is not spelled out completely explicitly in the\ntext, but it can—and needs to—be inferred by the hearer. For argumentation mining, this situ-\nation of implicit standpoints can be diﬃcult to handle, as we will see later on.\nOne question to ask at this point concerns the range of possible standpoints, or the range\nof ‘things that we can argue for’. That range is naturally very wide, but broad classiﬁcations have\nbeen suggested, in addition to that by Aristotle mentioned above. For Eggs[2000], the three\nbasic categories are:\n• theepistemic argument: some proposition is true or false;\n• theethical (oresthetical ) argument: something is good or bad (or: beautiful or ugly); and\n• thedeontic argument: some action should be done or not done.\nSometimes, the vocabulary used in an argument provides hints as to which category the stand-\npoint belongs to—at least as long as the argument is not too indirect. For illustration, here is an\nexample of an esthetical argument, taken from a ﬁlm review.2We marked some words indicating\nthe realm of esthetics in boldface.\n(1.2) Of all Greenaway’s works (...), this is probably the British ﬁlmmaker’s least eﬀective. As\nwith all of his ﬁlms, the choreography of people and objects before the camera (...) is\nelaborate and splendid. The ﬁlm also marks some of Greenaway’s favorite thematic\nobsessions, including (in no particular order) spiritual and corporeal rotting , Sir Isaac\nNewton and arcane mullings on things historic, classical and numerical.\nBut Greenaway’s narrative and his direction of actors—two elements which only\nrecently has he concerned himself with—are without foundation. After the eﬀects of the\nvisualpresentation have worn oﬀ, the ﬁlm becomes rather tiresome to follow.\n2Desson Howe, The Washington Post.

INTRODUCTION\n1.1.2 HOW DO WE ARGUE?\nHaving described the static view of whatconstitutes argumentation, we now move to a more\nprocess-oriented perspective that is interested in howargumentation unfolds. We already em-\nphasized that we are dealing with a social activity that involves a speaker3and a hearer, where the\nlatter can be a speciﬁc person, or alternatively a broader and possibly quite unspeciﬁc audience\n(as with the ﬁlm review in The Washington Post ).\nLet us start with the case where two (or more) people seek to resolve a disagreement. They\nengage in a debate and aim for reaching a conclusion that—at best—leaves everybody happy,\nor—at least—makes none of the participants too unhappy. This is a process that constitutes the\nheartof,forinstance,politicaldeliberation:makingdecisionsafteracarefulandthoroughweigh-\ning of the options and their potential consequences. Greek philosophy had a lot to say about the\nrules of conduct that enable successful deliberation; in more recent times, the German philoso-\npherHabermas [1981] (among others) studied the role of rational activity in modern society and\nespecially in communication. Within the ﬁeld of argumentation theory, the pragma-dialectical\nschool [van Eemeren and Grootendorst, 2004] put forward a theory of what constitutes a ‘crit-\nical discussion’: what kind of behavior is expected of the participants, what protocol to use, and\nso on. Their work exempliﬁes foremost a normative approach to argumentation theory: It seeks\nto specify how things should be done, ideally. For the practical goals of argumentation mining,\nthis may seem of a lesser relevance, but in fact, work in the pragma-dialectical school has also\nstudied the linguistic aspects of the enterprise. For instance, van Eemeren et al. [2007] identiﬁed\npatterns of formulation that can typically occur at diﬀerent stages of a critical discussion.\nThe normative perspective emphasizes the central role of rational thought in argumenta-\ntion, as does the deﬁnition we quoted in the beginning. Indeed, most arguments should ulti-\nmately reﬂect a pattern of sound reasoning, but still, in most real-world instances of argumen-\ntation, there are additional inﬂuences at work. For one thing, beyond claiming to demonstrate\na sound inference, speakers may very well stress their own personal authority on the subject,\nin order to reinforce the acceptability of their standpoint. They may point out that they have\nstudied the matter for a long time, remind the hearer that they are formally in a teacher-student\nrelation, cite an external source that enjoys high public esteem, etc. Obviously, such moves are\nindependent of the underlying reasoning, but they can add ‘weight’ to the standpoint the speaker\nputs forward.\nFurthermore, as we so far only hinted at, argumentation in most cases is a process that\ncan stretch across multiple dialogue turns, or across a sequence of sentences. It brings together\nthe “constellation of propositions”, as the deﬁnition calls them, and importantly, speakers face\nthe task of organizing that constellation in a linear linguistic contribution. Some portions of a\ncomplex argument may be closely related, others may be more distinct. Some points may be\nrated as more important or ‘weighty’ (by the speaker) than others. Therefore, the linearization\n3Throughout the book, we use ‘speaker’ and ‘hearer’ as cover terms that should be taken to also subsume writers and readers;\nin other words, we generally do not distinguish between the diﬀerent linguistic modes.\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n1.1. ARGUMENTS AND ARGUING 5\nof the argument’s portions in a text should not be left to coincidence. On the contrary: being\nable to arrange one’s argumentative speech in such a manner that it promises to be eﬀective has\nfor a long time been considered an art. The discipline in charge of this is Rhetoric , and it studies\nthe relative merits of diﬀerent strategies for communicating a standpoint. The psychological side\nof this task is persuasion: techniques for trying to make sure that the audience will respond to\nthe speaker’s message in the desired way. Persuasion is closely related to argumentation, but it\nclearly has other ingredients in addition.\nIn the terminology of Aristotle, the three central factors determining the success of an\nargumentative exchange are labeled as follows.\n•Logos:Speakers employ rules of sound reasoning:\n(1.3) That building needs to be demolished, because it is full of asbestos, which is known\nto be hazardous, and there is no way to stop its diﬀusion from the diﬀerent parts of\nthe building.\n•Ethos:Speakers signal their authority or credibility (or that of their source):\n(1.4) That building needs to be demolished, because it is full of asbestos, as the report by\nthe university engineers has shown.\n•Pathos: Speakers seek to communicate their standpoint in a manner that seeks to evoke an\nemotional response:\n(1.5) That building needs to be demolished, because it is an irresponsible source of\ndanger to the health and indeed the life of our children who spend so many hours in\nthose poisonous rooms every day!\nOf course, the three dimensions do not usually occur in isolation; most arguments will mix them\nwith each other, to diﬀerent degrees. But the logos dimension is arguably the most important\none, and for argumentation mining the most relevant. Notice that the deﬁnition we worked\nthrough at the beginning of the chapter also centered on logos (“a rational activity”).\nBoth in dialogue and in monologue text, argumentation can become quite complex and\ngive rise to intricate relationships among diﬀerent linguistic units. As argumentation mining\nhas so far focused mainly on written text (monologue, or social media interactions), we will\nin the following emphasize this perspective. In many argumentative texts, such as newspaper\neditorials or blog posts, the audience is not a clearly identiﬁed hearer but an unspeciﬁc set of\nreaders. Still, the task for the speakers remains the same: they seek to inﬂuence the standpoint\nof the audience, and for doing that they need to anticipate the positions that the audience likely\ntakes on the issue. In response to this hearer model, the speaker selects material to present in\nsupport of their view, and furthermore has the option to explicitly consider possible objections\nby the audience. Such counter-considerations, as we will call them, represent the viewpoint not\nof the speaker but of the anticipated hearer—the ‘opposing view’—and the speaker is advised to\n\n--- Page 21 ---\n6 1. INTRODUCTION\nnot only cite them but also refute them, as in this example, which has already been divided into\nits ‘minimal units’ as a ﬁrst step of analysis:\n(1.6) [We really need to turn down that building.] 0[Granted, it will be expensive,] 1[but the\ndegree of asbestos contamination is not tolerable anymore.] 2[Also, it is one of the most\nugly buildings in town!] 3\nArgumentationstructure isthetermwewilluseforwhatwascalleda‘constellationofpropositions’\nin the deﬁnition given at the beginning of this chapter. Looking at Example 1.6, this structure\nconsists of claims made by the speaker (here: unit 0), material they present in support of their\nclaims (here: 3), as well as possible counter-considerations (here: 1) and their refutations (here:\n2). In a similar (yet less explicit) way, the author of Example 1.2above ﬁrst states his verdict\n(the director’s least eﬀective ﬁlm), then presents a positive evaluation (nice choreography; an\nobservation that is in opposition to the general verdict) before closing with an argument that\nsupports the negative verdict, suitably initiated with the conjunction but.\nFinally, to complicate matters, an argumentative text may of course also contain non-\nargumentative portions such as background information, whose identiﬁcation is part of the over-\nall task of argumentation mining.\n1.2 MINING ARGUMENTS: A DEFINITION\nFor illustration, Figure 1.1gives a possible graph representation of the structure found in Exam-\nple1.6. It follows the notation proposed by Peldszus and Stede [2013] (which is in turn based\non that of Freeman [1991]). Circle nodes denote statements representing the proponent’s view,\nwhile the boxed node (1) indicates the voice of the opposing viewpoint. Unit (0) is the central\nclaim of the text, on which (1) places an ‘attack’ of type ‘rebut’: It gives a reason why (0) should\nnot hold. The author proceeds with a counterargument (2), which is an ‘undercut’ type of attack\non the ‘rebut’ relation, thus indicating that (1) is not regarded as a good or suﬃcient argument\nagainst (0). Finally, (3) provides an argument directly in favor of (0); this is commonly called\nthe ‘support’ relation.\nWe will look into such argument diagrams in depth in Section 3.6, and the distinction\nbetween undercutting and rebutting is taken up in Sections 4.1and6.2. At this point, however,\nwe regard a graph of this kind as one possible outcome of argumentation mining and will now\nbrieﬂy summarize the overall problem. In its full-ﬂedged form, it involves the following subtasks\n(possibly, but not necessarily, in this order).\n1. Identify argumentative text (or a portion of a text) (see Chapter 5).\n2. Segment the text into argumentative discourse units (ADUs) (see Chapter 5).\n3. Identify the central claim (see Chapter 5).\n4. Identify the role/function of ADUs (see Chapters 5and6).\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n1.2. MINING ARGUMENTS: A DEFINITION 7\nrebutundercut\nsupport 01\n2\n3\n[0] We real ly need to turn\ndown that building.[1] Granted, it will be\nexpensive,[3] Also, it is one of the\nugliest buildings in town. [2] but the degree of asbestos\ncontamination is not \ntolerable anymore.\nFigure 1.1: Graph representation of argumentation structure for Example 1.6.\n5. Identify relations between ADUs (see Chapter 6).\n6. Build the overall structural representation (see Chapter 7).\n7. Identify the type and the quality of the argumentation (see Chapter 8).\nStep1is of course unnecessary if the text genre under consideration is by deﬁnition argu-\nmentative. Otherwise, in a scenario where the type of text is not clearly known, an argumenta-\ntivity classiﬁcation is needed, which can be applied either to complete texts or to portions of text,\nif documents can contain both argumentative and non-argumentative parts. Step 2 can either be\ncombined with some of the other tasks, or carried out as a separate procedure, which designates\nclauses, sentences, or sequences of them as ADUs of the argumentative structure. An essential\ntask for any argumentation mining scenario is step 3, which tries to isolate the central claim that\nis being argued for. Similarly, step 4classiﬁes the role that ADUs play for the argumentation,\nsuch as whether it is a piece of evidence, or a possible objection. Step 5establishes relations (like\n‘Support’ and ‘Attack’) between the ADUs.\nFor some purposes, simpler versions will do: Often, argument is deﬁned as merely ‘a set\nof premises and a conclusion’, which reduces step 4to identifying premises, and eliminates step\n5 (as the Support relation then is implicitly given).\nOn the other hand, an application that aims at building a full structure like the one given\nin Figure 1.1needs step 6.\n\n--- Page 23 ---\n8 1. INTRODUCTION\nFinally, if desired, in step 7one can detect additional attributes of the argument, such as\nthe particular type of argument from a range of predeﬁned classes, or the underlying reasoning\npattern; or in general assess the quality of the argument made: is it coherent and convincing?\nAll these tasks will be discussed in detail in Chapters 5–8.\n1.3 WHY STUDY ARGUMENTATION MINING?\nThe ability to automatically detect arguments and particularly the support in an argumenta-\ntion can be very valuable for many purposes. Most analyses of arguments so far have relied\non painstaking manual reconstruction and annotation, which severely limits the scalability and\nspeed of argumentative analysis. This, in turn, has limited our ability to build systems that de-\npend on and use argumentative structure.\n(Manual) argumentative analysis can be used to check the soundness of a given (line of)\nargument. Fallacies in argumentation have been studied for millennia, in order to determine the\nconditions under which an argument that is typically a fallacy may be reasonable after all. Thus,\nmanualanalysisallowsargumentstobeexaminedandeithervalidatedordiscarded.Inparticular,\nwhen an argument is fully formalized and represented in logic, it can be treated as blobs that are\nnotevaluatedinternally,whereonlytheoverallstructureisevaluated.Forexample,Figure 1.1can\nbe viewed without attention to the meaning of each numbered text fragment, focusing just on\nthe structure, wherein statement 1 is supported by statement 4; statement 2 attacks statement\n1 and is in turn attacked by statement 3. This can be interpreted as a bipolar argumentation\nframework [Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex ,2005], which we will introduce in Section 3.4.1.\nIn such a context, automatic reasoners can be used to determine whether an argument is\nsound. Given conﬂicting information, reasoners can also determine maximally consistent sub-\nsets. However, the application of such systems is naturally limited by the input available to them.\nArgumentation mining could ﬁll this gap by ﬁnding instances of ‘real-life’ arguments in texts.\nWe will discuss the connection between argumentation and reasoning in Chapter 3.\nNatural language processing (NLP) has already contributed to mining both social media\nand open knowledge. Global communication technologies, including social media, have raised\ninterest in large-scale analysis of written conversations. Meanwhile, large corpora of open access\nscientiﬁc documents in some ﬁelds have enabled large-scale mining of knowledge. Argumen-\ntation mining can deepen and enrich these current mining eﬀorts, to truly support web-scale\ndiscourse and debate.\nGiventhe importance of arguments in human sensemaking and decisionmaking,the abil-\nity to detect and extract arguments in written texts can enable computer support using argumen-\ntative structure. Thereby, an online discussion board could visually summarize the current state\nof a discussion, without constraining individual replies or needing a human analyst, showing\neach person’s perspective and its relation to the overall discussion. Currently, human sensemak-\ning and decision making is easily overwhelmed because the work in making sense of a debate\ngrows with each new contribution, limiting the potential of massive groups to have debates.\n\n--- Page 24 ---\n1.4. OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK 9\nFurther, argument identiﬁcation can be used to identify arguments in a written essay, to\naid in essay scoring or to provide instantaneous feedback to support writing instruction. The Ed-\nucational Testing Service in the U.S. is investigating how argumentation mining can contribute\nto automated scoring of argumentative essays that students write as part of college admissions\ntesting; we will come back to these topics throughout Chapters 5–7.\nAlso, argument summarization in near-real-time could be facilitated with argumentation\nmining, by enabling detailed arguments to be viewed at multiple levels of granularity: zooming\nout of the structure would show the main points in the argument, while zooming in would\nshow the detail in each point. This would enable small groups to carefully check the validity\nof arguments. For example, researchers in an Alzheimer’s research consortium are investigating\nhow to automatically interlink scholarly arguments to source materials, and how to capture the\nresearch lab data supporting these arguments.\nAutomatic argument retrieval could help lawyers ﬁnd relevant case law. Similarly, re-\ntrieving arguments for or against a position can also be relevant for e-government and gaining\nfeedback on public policy.\nFinally, we mention the current activity of IBM Research, who are working on Debating\nTechnology with the ultimate goal of a software agent that is able to understand and produce\narguments, and do so in a dialogue with human beings. Various contributions made by this\nresearch group so far will be covered in Chapters 5and6.\n1.4 OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK\nIn Chapter 2we approach the notion of argumentation from a linguistic perspective and dis-\ncuss a range of phenomena that motivate distinctions between argumentative text and non-\nargumentative text. We also touch on a number of concepts that are closely related to argumen-\ntation, such as subjectivity, opinion, and rhetoric. Chapter 3, in contrast, takes the viewpoint of\nargumentationtheory and introducesseveral key aspects of argumentativereasoningand the for-\nmalrepresentationofarguments.Afterward,inChapter 4weturntonaturallanguageprocessing\nand begin with a brief overview of schemata that have been proposed to annotate arguments in\ntext, and we introduce a number of relevant corpora that can be used in argumentation min-\ning research. Chapter 5explains our approach to dividing argumentation mining into a number\nof relatively isolated subtasks, which reﬂects the practice of most current research. The chapter\nbegins with the goals of identifying text as argumentative, and ﬁnding claims, i.e., the most im-\nportant part of an argument. The second most important parts are the statements being made\nin support of a claim, and this is the topic of Chapter 6, which also looks at ﬁnding possible\nobjections to claims. For some purposes, it is important to derive the complete constellation of\nclaims and supporting and objecting statements, which is covered in Chapter 7. Then, Chap-\nter8addresses several tasks that seek more detailed information about the arguments found,\ne.g., their quality and consistency. That concludes the perspective of mining, and we continue in\n\n--- Page 25 ---\n10 1. INTRODUCTION\nChapter 9with a brief discussion of the problem of producing argumentative text automatically.\nFinally, Chapter 10provides a summary and suggests an outlook for the ﬁeld.\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n11\nC H A P T E R 2\nArgumentative Language\nIn this chapter, we consider the linguistic side of argumentation: What does the language of\narguinglooklike,andhowdoesitdiﬀerfromotherwaysofspeakingorwriting?Thechapterthus\nis intended to serve primarily as background for readers who approach argumentation mining\nfrom a technical perspective and are interested in the underlying linguistic phenomena and their\nterminology.\nFor a start, we consider the notion of subjectivity (Section 2.1), which quite clearly sub-\nsumesthephenomenonofargumentation.AsavastamountofNLPworkonsubjectivitycenters\nspeciﬁcally on opinion, we brieﬂy explore its relationship to argumentation (Section 2.2). Then,\nwe approach our topic from the perspective of speechacttheory : some scholars hold the view that\nan argument should be regarded as a complex speech act (Section 2.3). The linguistic realization\nof arguments is often very similar to that of explanations andjustiﬁcations, which can be seen\nas related speech acts, and we will draw comparisons (Section 2.4). Thereafter, we turn to the\nidea of analyzing argumentation as one of ﬁve basic linguistic modes, which supposedly correlate\n(albeit not in a simple way) with particular surface features of utterances or text (Section 2.5).\nThe chapter closes with a look at rhetoric , i.e., the art of crafting a text in such a way that it is\nmost likely to have the intended eﬀects on the readers (Section 2.6).\n2.1 SUBJECTIVITY\nFor deﬁning subjectivity, we follow Wiebe et al. [2005] in adopting the notion of private state\nfrom the English grammar of Quirk et al. [1985]. The idea is: while a person’s actions can be\nobserved by the outside world, her current mental state (what does she think, how does she feel,\netc.) is not open to that observation. This distinction can be projected to that person’s linguistic\nutterances: some of them describe a state of aﬀairs in the world, and listeners can in principle\njudgethemastrueorfalse—these‘objective’statementsareamatterofintersubjectiveagreement\nor disagreement.\n(2.1) There is a cat on the mat.\n(2.2) Winston Churchill came to oﬃce in 1940.\nOn the other hand, when the speaker decides to reveal a private state, there is no point\nin replying Not true! We may very well like or dislike that particular revelation, but objecting to\nits truth is usually not an option. Here are some kinds of private state verbalization that we can\ndistinguish.\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n12 2. ARGUMENTATIVE LANGUAGE\n(2.3) Reveal an emotion: Hooray!\n(2.4) Give an opinion: That’s a really bad wine.\n(2.5) Make a judgment: You don’t deserve the prize.\n(2.6) Make a prognosis: There will be snow tomorrow.\n(2.7) Give an estimate or speculation: I guess that’s a llama over there.\nGranted, a listener may legitimately react to these statements with some objection, but then the\nobjection applies to the expressed content of the private state, not to its revelation. For example,\na listener responding with Wrong! to2.7objects to the notion of the creature over there being\na llama—and not to the fact that the speaker thinksotherwise (more technically: wrong does\nnot scope over Iguess). Very often, these cases are ambiguous (and can sometimes produce mis-\nunderstanding) when those verbs of cognition are not explicitly stated but left implicit by the\nspeaker, as is the case in Examples 2.4–2.6.\nOpinion and emotion In NLP, some of these subjectivity categories have received more at-\ntention than others. The most-researched one is that of ‘opinion’, which we will consider in\nmore detail in the next section. The task of ‘opinion mining’ is sometimes interchangeably called\n‘sentiment analysis’, but it seems appropriate to diﬀerentiate between these terms. We will use\n‘sentiment’ for the subclass of subjective utterances that comprises opinion, judgment, and emo-\ntion, where ‘opinion’ is reserved for evaluations that are directed toward some entity—an object,\ninstitution, abstract idea, etc. This list should not include human beings, though, as we follow\nappraisaltheory [Martin and White ,2005] in distinguishing ‘judgment’ (the evaluation of a per-\nson’s behavior, character, appearance, ex. 2.5) from opinions about non-human entities (ex. 2.4).\nEmotion detection (ex. 2.3) is a popular NLP task, too, and it can obviously overlap with\nopinion mining, when, for example, a customer review contains an expression of enthusiasm in\nresponse to the product in question. But in general the two have to be kept distinct: We can ﬁnd\nboth non-opinionated emotions (ex. 2.3) and non-emotional opinions (ex. 2.4).\nPrognoses and speculations While a large portion of opinion, judgment, and emotion es-\nsentially centers on valence, i.e., whether a positive or negative polarity is expressed, prognoses\n(ex.2.6) and speculations (ex. 2.7) focus instead on truth vs. falsity, or more speciﬁcally the de-\ngree of belief in the truth of a proposition. We view prognoses as always referring to the future,\nwhereas speculations may pertain to the past, present, or future.\nIn NLP, detecting speculation or ‘hedging’ is a prominent task (e.g., Farkas et al. [2010]).\nIt can be applied for instance to the analysis of scientiﬁc writing, medical reports, or political\ndiscourse. Hedging can be intentionally employed by a speaker to remain vague so that she can’t\nbe held accountable for having committed to the truth of a statement. The following example\ncarefully avoids taking a deﬁnite stance on the question of the patient having diabetes or not.\n(2.8) There is no clear symptom of diabetes.\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n2.1. SUBJECTIVITY 13\nDetecting subjectivity For many computational tasks it is important to automatically distin-\nguish subjective from non-subjective language. The term subjectivityclassiﬁcation, however, today\nis most frequently used in conjunction with the more narrow goal of opinion mining, where it\nis employed as an initial step of identifying documents or parts of documents in which opinions\nshould be looked for (or not). The classical work on subjectivity classiﬁcation by Wiebe et al.\n[2004], however, started out from a broader goal, viewing subjective language as “expressing\nopinions, evaluations, and speculations” in the spirit of the range we sketched above (cf. ex. 2.3–\n2.7). Their features were purely lexical (n-grams), and the main evaluation task was to separate\nopinionated from non-opinionated Wall Street Journal texts (as derived from the category la-\nbels given in the corpus). This makes the work quite similar to that of genre classiﬁcation, when\nit is applied to genres that are partly deﬁned by subjectivity. The works by Petrenz and Webber\n[2011] or Krüger et al. [2017], for example, address separating newspaper text into opinionated\nvs. non-opinionated sub-genres (essentially: editorials and letters to the editor vs. news); here,\nthe emphasis is less on lexical n-grams but on linguistically motivated features such as the pres-\nence of modal verbs or the tense of verbs: For news reports, there is a tendency to favor past\ntense, while editorials more often use present tense.\nAn ambitious version of subjectivity classiﬁcation would aim not merely at making a bi-\nnary distinction of whether or not a passage is subjective (or opinionated, or hedged), but rather\natdiﬀerentiatingthediﬀerentkindsofsubjectivitywehaveillustratedabove(andpossiblymore).\nThe current work in the ﬁeld, however, tends to focus on speciﬁc subproblems, which are obvi-\nously easier to tackle.\nRegarding argumentative language, we conclude that it is by deﬁnition subjective, but that\nsubjectivity classiﬁcation (as currently operationalized) is too coarse-grained to solve the task of\nﬁnding text passages containing arguments in particular. Since argumentation involves more\nthan a single statement and thus is inherently relational, it is important to consider the subjec-\ntivity status of individual statements as well as the constraints on their potential combination.\nVeriﬁability Amoveintothisdirectionwasmadeby ParkandCardie [2014],whowerespecif-\nically interested in the argumentative relation of support. They proposed to distinguish between\nthe following categories of statements.\n• Veriﬁable: objective assertions (not about personal feelings or interpretations), which com-\nprise two subcategories:\n–Veriﬁable-private: statements that concern the speaker’s personal state or experience.\n–Veriﬁable-public: no personal state or experience is involved; public information is\nsuﬃcient to verify the statement.\n• Unveriﬁable: statements that cannot be proven with objective evidence.\nThedistinctionwemadeatthebeginningofthissectionalreadyseparatedVeriﬁable-publicfrom\nthe other categories; hence, we need to consider Park and Cardie’s suggestion to also separate\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n14 2. ARGUMENTATIVE LANGUAGE\nthe categories Veriﬁable-Private and Unveriﬁable. They reserve the former for statements that\nreport on a speaker’s experiences, which are ‘in principle’ veriﬁable, but for practical purposes\nthe necessary information is just not publicly available. Here are three of their examples.1\n(2.9) My son has hypoglycemia.\n(2.10) They ﬂew me to NY in February.\n(2.11) The ﬂight attendant yelled at the passengers.\nSo, in such veriﬁable-private statements, the speaker often talks explicitly about herself, but the\nthird example shows that this is not obligatory: speakers can recall past perceptions, where their\naudience usually has no means of verifying the statement.\nWhen making categorizations of this kind, it is important to be clear about how certain\nmodalizers and verbs of perception or cognition are handled (as we pointed out earlier when\ndiscussing ex. 2.7). For Park and Cardie, both “Peanuts do not kill people” and “I believe that\npeanuts do not kill people” are veriﬁable-public, so in the second example, I believe is merely\na way of weakening the assertion. Along these lines, our Example 2.7(“I guess that’s a llama\nover there”) is also veriﬁable-public: the veriﬁcation pertains to the question of the presence\nof a llama, and not to the speaker’s guessing activity. (Note, however, that in other contexts,\nexpressions like I believe that X may need a more elaborate analysis than that of weakening the\nstatement of X.)\nAs their next step, Park and Cardie propose some constraints on how the diﬀerent types\nof statements are to be supported in argumentation: for unveriﬁable statements, speakers may\ngive areason(“I don’t like this wine, because it has so much tannin”), while for veriﬁable-public\nstatements they can provide evidence : “I tell you Winston Churchill came to oﬃce in 1940. I\nsaw it on Wikipedia!” For veriﬁable-private statements, providing evidence is an optional move;\nalthough hearers are not really in a position to question a statement like (“I have a headache”),\nstill the speaker may go on to explain it (“Maybe I had too much wine last night”).\nSimilar classiﬁcations have been proposed elsewhere in the literature, and we will return to\nthismatterlateroninChapter 6.Fornow,relatingtheideastotheinitialdeﬁnitionof‘argument’\nthat we quoted from van Eemeren and Grootendorst (see page 1), notice that classiﬁcations of\nstatements along the lines of Park and Cardie try to add more ﬁne-grained distinctions to the\nmove of ‘justifying a standpoint’. One question that has to be dealt with here is: what kind of\nstatement qualiﬁes as a standpoint and thus as something that can or should be argued for?\n2.2 OPINION, STANCE, AND ARGUMENT\nWith opinion mining being such a prominent subtask of subjectivity analysis, we brieﬂy take a\nspeciﬁc look at the relationship that arguments have to opinions, and to the related notion of\nstance.\n1For more examples from a diﬀerent corpus study, see Habernal and Gurevych [2017, p. 154].\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n2.2. OPINION, STANCE, AND ARGUMENT 15\nFollowing Liu[2012, p. 11], we deﬁne an opinion as a tuple consisting (maximally) of a\ntarget (the entity being evaluated), the expressed sentiment toward that target, the holder of the\nopinion, and the time at which it is known to hold. A program performing opinion mining thus\ntries to locate the presence of an opinion in a document, and then to instantiate the tuple, as far\nas possible (some elements of the tuple may be regarded as optional).\nThe obvious connection to argumentation mining is given when authors provide one or\nmorereasons for their opinion. An opinionated statement is an instance of a standpoint, as we\ndeﬁned it in Section 1.1, because clearly, diﬀerent people may evaluate the target in diﬀerent\nand potentially conﬂicting ways. Then, when a reason is provided, as in Example 2.12below,\nwe have a constellation of a claim and a supporting statement. This easily extends to multiple\nreasons, and also to more complex structures where a reason can in turn be supported. In 2.12,\nfor instance, the speaker might continue with a statement providing evidence for the overloaded\nnature of a Wagner opera.\n(2.12) I never enjoyed Wagner’s operas, as they are so enormously overloaded.\nFinding the constellation of reasons for an opinion can thus be regarded as an instance of argu-\nmentation mining.\nA more elaborate relationship between the two realms is proposed by Rajendran et al.\n[2016],whoareinterestedinso-called‘implicitopinions’.Intheseopinions,thesentimentarises\nnot from words that generally convey polarity (and thus are to be listed in general sentiment\nlexicons) but from factual statements that only imply an evaluation. These so-called ‘polar facts’\nare domain-speciﬁc and rather diﬃcult to detect automatically; two examples are given below.\n(2.13) camera review The viewﬁnder is somewhat dark.\n(2.14) hotel review The rooms turned out to be small.\nThe two attributes (dark, small) are not in general negative, but when applied to the speciﬁc\nobjects here, they invite us to infer a disappointed attitude on the writer’s side. Rajendran et al.\nnow see a parallel to the task of reconstructing enthymemes2in argumentation analysis: Given\nour two examples above, when the conclusion is a negative verdict by the reviewer, then an\nunstated major premise provides the link between the explicated minor premise (as above) and\nthe conclusion.\n(2.15) The viewﬁnder is somewhat dark (+ A dark viewﬁnder is considered bad).\n!I am not in favor of the camera.\n(2.16) The rooms turned out to be small (+ A small room is considered bad).\n!I am not in favor of the hotel.\nEnthymeme reconstruction is a very diﬃcult problem, but it has been addressed in argumenta-\ntion mining to some extent in recent years, as we will discuss in Section 8.1.\n2Enthymemes are arguments in which a premise or the conclusion are left unstated, for the hearer to supply.\n\n--- Page 31 ---\n16 2. ARGUMENTATIVE LANGUAGE\nStance Finally, the similarity between opinion classiﬁcation and stanceclassiﬁcation is in the\ncommon goal of determining a polarity, i.e., a for-or-against attitude on the side of the speaker.\nIn stance classiﬁcation, however, the ‘target’ is pre-deﬁned, and it is often not a speciﬁc entity\n(such as a product) but an issue or a topic under debate. It is often performed for tweets, and\nalso for online forums, where users exchange their views on questions like “behavior X (is/is not)\nacceptable” or “legislation X (should/should not) be dropped”.\nAnother popular genre for stance classiﬁcation is student essays, whose authors have been\ninstructed to explain their position on a certain topic. Here, as well as in online forums, the topic\nor issue is clearly a ‘critical standpoint’, and the texts that are being analyzed are by deﬁnition\nargumentative.\nTherefore, stance classiﬁcation can be considered as a subproblem of argumenta-\ntion mining, when the pairing of topic and stance—such as (mandatory vaccination of\nchildren/against)—corresponds to what we called the ‘central claim’ of the text, i.e., the state-\nment that the speaker is arguing for. We will take a closer look at the task of stance classiﬁcation\nin Section 6.3.\n2.3 ARGUMENT AND SPEECH ACTS\nAs pointed out in Chapter 1, the goal of argumentation usually is to inﬂuence the state of mind\nof the addressees, or to change their behavior. This is, generally speaking, a matter of inﬂicting\nchange on ‘the world’, and this in turn is conspicuously close to the slogan underlying the notion\nofspeechacttheory3:Usinglanguageisaformofcarryingout actions—comparabletoswitchingon\nthe light, cooking dinner, and so on—and therefore it has consequences. A linguistic utterance\nmade by a speaker, once completed, does not simply vanish but leaves its marks on the world (or\nat least on a very small portion of it): The listener may have new information, or be doubtful of\na previously assumed ‘fact’, or feel oﬀended, etc. Thus, there is a close connection between the\nrealms of speech acts and argumentation, and hence we provide a brief overview here.\nThe most profound changes to ‘the world’ are triggered by utterances that occur in situa-\ntions such as the judge sentencing the defendant in court, an authority christening a ship, or the\npriest marrying a couple. Contexts like these were a central motivation for the work of Austin\n[1975], who is nowadays widely credited for the ﬁrst systematic exposition of a theory of speech\nacts. Beyond the relatively dramatic examples just mentioned, Austin entertained—at least for\nsome time—the hypothesis that a certain class of ‘performative’ verbs plays such a fundamental\nrole that they can be used to paraphrase essentially any sentence in such a way that its function\nbecomes transparent.\n(2.17) You shouldn’t read that book. !I advise you not to read that book.\n(2.18) What is your name? !I ask you to tell me your name.\n3For a slightly more elaborate, chapter-long introduction to the topic and a discussion of its contentious points, see Saddock\n[2005].\n\n--- Page 32 ---\n2.3. ARGUMENT AND SPEECH ACTS 17\n(2.19) Yesterday I met a philosopher. !I assert that I met a philosopher yesterday.\n(2.20) Max is the smartest kid in the world. !I claim that Max is the smartest kid in the\nworld.\n(2.21) It’s about 15 degrees out there.! I estimate that it is about 15 degrees out there.\nThe fact that people in daily life typically do notconstantly use those extended versions con-\ntributes to ambiguity and sometimes to misunderstanding (but, arguably, makes communica-\ntion much more interesting); recall our discussion of Examples 2.3–2.7 at the beginning of the\nchapter. This ambiguity in the roles that utterances can play also makes the task of argumenta-\ntion mining diﬃcult, because in some way or another, the status of individual statements that\ntake part in argumentation needs to be determined (and that would be much easier if those\nperformative verbs were present).\nClassifyingspeechacts Austin’s idea of collecting all the relevant verbs in a language in order\nto deﬁne the ‘landscape’ of speech acts is today generally regarded as a dead end for the advance-\nment of speech act theory. Instead, a prominent task has been to come up with a classiﬁcation\n(and deﬁnition) of generalized types of speech acts. A number of such typologies have been\nproposed, and a popular one is that by Searle[1976].\n•Representatives: Speaker commits to the truth of an assertion.\n•Directives: Speaker tries to make addressee perform some action.\n•Expressives: Speaker expresses an emotional state.\n•Declaratives: Speaker changes the state of the world by means of performing the utter-\nance.\n•Commissives: Speaker comits to doing some action in the future.\nWithin these broad classes, sub-taxonomies may be postulated, and ultimately, speciﬁc speech\nacts can be deﬁned. Searle[1969] proposed to construct systematic deﬁnitions by means of dif-\nferent kinds of rules that characterize the propositional content of the utterance, the situational\nconditions that need to hold for the speech act to be performed successfully (‘preparatory rules’),\na ‘sincerity’ rule committing the speaker to be sincere in expressing her psychological states, and\nan ‘essential’ rule that describes the central pragmatic impact of the speech act in question. It\nis important to note that these rules (as opposed to, say, rules of grammar) are not about well-\nformedness—this is a notion that does not apply to speech acts. Instead, the key concept is that\nof a speech act to be ‘felicitous’, to successfully serve its purpose. Infelicitous speech act attempts\noccur, for example, when somebody pronounces somebody else to be married but is in no legal\nposition to do so; or when somebody promises an addressee to do him a favor yet does not really\nintend to do so (insincerity).\n\n--- Page 33 ---\n18 2. ARGUMENTATIVE LANGUAGE\nComponents of a speech act The ﬁve class labels mentioned above are often said to describe\nthe ‘illocutionary force’ of an utterance. This derives from another important sub-classiﬁcation\nmade by Austin and (in a slightly diﬀerent way) by Searle. The idea is that the performance of\na speech act involves the following three sub-acts that occur (more or less) simultaneously.\n•Locutionaryact: producing the linguistic utterance, by speaking or writing (or gesturing).\n•Illocutionaryact: the intention or goal the speaker has in mind when performing the act.\n•Perlocutionary act: the eﬀect that the performance of the act has on the addressee.\nOne reason to distinguish illocution from perlocution is that an utterance may well have—from\nthe speaker’s perspective—unintended or even undesired eﬀects. A speaker could comment on\nthe addressee’s new hairstyle in a neutral way, and the addressee might derive the literal meaning\n(as intended by the speaker) but in addition surmise a secondary meaning and feel oﬀended (as\nnot intended by the speaker).\nFor argumentation, the perlocution is of obvious relevance, as it characterizes precisely\nthat ‘change of mind’ on the addressee’s side, which is the purpose of the speaker devising their\nargument.Researchon persuasion seekstodetectorevenmeasurethestrengthofsucheﬀects.For\nspeech act theory, however, the perlocution is a private state that is of limited interest; the heart\nof the matter is the perspective of the speaker and thus the illocutionary force of her utterance.\nLinguistic signals Languages provide a variety of means to explicitly signal the presence of\na speech act, or to constrain the class of possible speech acts, so that listeners may reconstruct\nthe speaker’s intention. Above, we mentioned performative verbs (e.g., ask, advise, ...), which in\nfact are the clearest indicators of illocutionary force. In general, however, the surface of an ut-\nterance contains only hints about the underlying illocution, and there is no simple 1:1 mapping.\nThe term ‘illocutionary force indicating device’, or IFID for short, was coined by Searle[1969]\nand is nowadays often used for referring to those hints. A prominent syntactic IFID is sentence\nmode (declarative, interrogative, imperative), which often enables straightforward identiﬁcation\nof a directive or a question.4But of course, both of these illocutions can also be produced with\ndeclarative mode (e.g., “I would like to inquire about the price of that car over there.”), which\ntherefore is quite ambiguous with respect to the speech act. The class of lexical IFIDs contains,\nbesides the performative verbs mentioned above, modal verbs and many diﬀerent kinds of ad-\nverbials from which the illocutionary force can be inferred. On the side of linguistic pragmatics,\nIFIDs for apologies have been studied intensively for many languages (e.g., Ogiermann [2009]).\nSome examples (more or less explicit) for English are as follows.\n(2.22) I apologize for being late.\n(2.23) Sorry I’m late.\n4Many speech act researchers consider (diﬀerent kinds of) questions as another basic speech act type in addition to the list\nofSearle[1976].\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n2.4. ARGUMENTATION, EXPLANATION, AND JUSTIFICATION 19\n(2.24) I’m a bit late, unfortunately.\n(2.25) I’m afraid I didn’t quite make it on time.\nIndirect speech acts The observation that illocutions can be marked more or less explicitly\npoints to another central notion in speech act theory: the ‘indirect’ speech act. The much-cited\nexample “Can you pass the salt?” on the surface is a yes-no question but is interpreted by the\nhearer as a polite form of a directive (or a subcategory ‘request’). The ambiguity also occurs\nvery frequently with declarative sentences that prima facie merely assert some information, yet\nare intended to convey additional illocutionary force. Our Examples 2.22and2.23above are\ndirect (explicit) apologies, with one being more formal than the other, whereas in Examples 2.24\nand2.25it is up to the hearer to read an apology into the utterances—this depends on the\nsituational context, how close the interlocutors are, etc.\nSpeech act theorists have tried to explain how these interpretations actually originate in\ncommunication. The two main approaches emphasize either a process of conventionalization,\nor the role of active inferencing on the hearer’s side; see Saddock [2005].\nArgumentation and complex speech acts In Section 2.1, we described the ideas of Park and\nCardie [2014] on associating statements with diﬀerent ‘veriﬁability’ statuses, and deriving con-\nsequencesfortheirpossiblerolesinanargument.Therealmofspeechactsprovidesanalternative\nperspective on the same goal: when the inventory of illocutionary force labels makes distinctions\nrelevant to argument components, a process of speech act labeling could be a preparatory step\nthat constrains the identiﬁcation of those components. Speciﬁcally, this can help with ﬁnding\nclaims, which can be opinions, speculations, prognoses, etc.—but not factual statements such as\n“I bought a new coﬀee maker yesterday”. For practical purposes, a crucial empirical question is\nto what extent IFIDs can be exploited for recognizing the relevant distinctions.\nBut the connection between speech act theory and argumentation can go a step further.\nWhile the traditional work on speech acts used the (idealized) notion of ‘sentence’ as the unit\nto be labeled, it is not impossible to extend it to pairs or even more complex constellations of\nlinguistic clauses. A systematic study on the possibilities of combining clauses into complex\nspeech acts of ‘concluding’ was presented (in German) by Klein[1987].\n2.4 ARGUMENTATION, EXPLANATION, AND\nJUSTIFICATION\nSeveral times in this chapter we mentioned the problems of ambiguity for identifying the com-\nponents of arguments and the relations between them. In this section, we provide a concrete\nexample, looking at the straightforward English construction “A, because B” (or equivalently:\n“Because B, A”). Of course, this can be the template for an argument, as Example 2.26demon-\nstrates: a is the claim (or standpoint), and B is the supporting statement.\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n20 2. ARGUMENTATIVE LANGUAGE\n(2.26) Using airplanes is really a bad idea because they are among the worst air polluters we\nhave ever created. (Argumentation/Persuasion)\n(2.27) An airplane is able to take oﬀ because the shape of the wings produces an upward force\nwhen the air ﬂows across them. (Explanation)\n(2.28) I need to use airplanes a lot because my job requires me to be in diﬀerent parts of the\ncountry every week. (Justiﬁcation)\nExamples 2.27and2.28make use of the same construction, but they have diﬀerent commu-\nnicative eﬀects. Example 2.27is easily used in a context where the listener already believes that\nairplanes can take oﬀ—the speaker thus does not aim to convince the hearer of that fact. Instead,\nthe new information for the hearer is (supposedly) in the second clause. This is the constellation\nof anexplanation , where A is not a claim but an undisputed fact and B does not ‘support’ A\nbut provides the reason why A holds. Example 2.28can be regarded as a special case, where the\nexplanation pertains to a personal decision. Hence, A does not necessarily have the status of an\nundisputed fact; the speaker has to consider that some hearers might not approve. This is the\nsituation of justiﬁcation: giving a reason for an attitude or an action that might be controversial—\nand if it is, then justiﬁcation becomes a special case of argumentation. Various theories of text\nstructure model diﬀerences like those in Examples 2.26–2.28 by using a speciﬁc coherencerelation\nfor each case; we will discuss this below in Section 2.6.2.\nWhile we used one linguistic construction for illustration here, English of course pro-\nvides many more ways to express the three constellations: other connectives are available, such\nastherefore ordue to, and often the sentences can be adjoined without any connective at all. But\nnotice that our three examples do not behave the same way in this respect: replacing the con-\njunction with a full stop in 2.27produces a somewhat odd result, while it is perfectly possible\nfor the other two.\nIn English, the conjunction because is highly versatile and can fulﬁll a wide range of prag-\nmatic functions. Other languages have tendencies to associate diﬀerent preferences with similar\nconnectives. In German, for example, the conjunctions weilanddennfor many speakers appear\nto be interchangeable (save for their syntactic diﬀerences: one is subordinating, one is coordi-\nnating); but research has shown that weiltends to mark objective causal relations (descriptions\nof causes in the world), whereas dennis more often used for subjective relations such as claim—\nsupport [Pasch, 1982]. In Dutch, an even more pronounced eﬀect along these lines has been\nshown for the conjunctions wantandomdatbySanders and Spooren [2009].\n2.5 TEXT TYPES AND DISCOURSE MODES\nIn Section 1.3, we mentioned a variety of genres that are particularly relevant for argumentation\nmining. The idea of the ‘genre’ (a set of texts that fulﬁll a common purpose and have commonal-\n\n--- Page 36 ---\n2.5. TEXT TYPES AND DISCOURSE MODES 21\nities in terms of functional components and/or linguistic conventions)5is generally well-known,\nand the importance of genre for many tasks in language technology is undisputed. In this sec-\ntion, however, we take a look at a lesser known notion, which has been alternatively called ‘text\ntype’ or ‘discourse mode’. It is related to genre, but should not be confused with it.\nTexttype=DiscourseMode In particular, while the genre is a property of a complete text, we\nhere focus on the unit of a stretch of sentences, often, but not necessarily, forming a paragraph.\nHence, the term ‘text type’ (as used, e.g., by Werlich [1975]) is a bit confusing, and we prefer\n‘discourse mode’, which Smith[2003] introduced for pretty much the same idea. It posits that\nthere is only a small set of basic functions that a series of sentences, or text passage, can fulﬁll.\nThese functions are to a good extent determined by the types of ‘discourse entities’ (events, states,\ngeneralizations, abstractions) that are mentioned in the passage, which in turn tend to correlate\nwith certain surface-linguistic features. One main theoretical goal for Smith (and earlier for\nWerlich) therefore was to establish the discourse passage as a unit of analysis for linguistics\nproper (rather than for the shady area of pragmatics). In Smith’s approach, there are ﬁve classes.\n•Narrative: Events and states are introduced, with events being temporally related. The\nsemantic types of events (un-/boundedness) indicate the progression of narrative time.\nTemporal connectives and adverbials are frequent instruments of clause linkage.\n(2.29) The passengers landed in New York in the middle of the night and then moved\non to Hoboken immediately.\n•Description: Passages include states and ongoing or atelic6events. Text progression is\ndriven by spatial rather than by temporal patterns; time is static. Locative phrases often\nappear in topic position.\n(2.30) Hundreds of people occupied the square. In front of them, the speaker was\nstanding on a small podium.\n•Report: Events, states, and sometimes general statives are introduced; they are not related\nrelative to each other (as in narrative). Tensed verbs, modals, and temporal adverbs are\nfrequent.\n(2.31) My sister visited the new exhibition yesterday.\n•Information: Facts, propositions, and generalizing states are introduced, which need not\nbe anchored in time and space. The text progresses through a ‘metaphorical’ space.\n(2.32) Krypton is one of the noble gases. It is one of the rarest elements on earth.\n5A more thorough introduction to the concept of genre and its role in computational linguistics is given in Stede[2011,\nSct. 2.1].\n6Atelicevent is one that comprises both a preparation and a culmination phase, e.g., ‘traveling to London’, ‘climbing the\nmountain’. An atelic event is homogeneous in time: ‘being ill’, ‘reading’.\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n22 2. ARGUMENTATIVE LANGUAGE\n•Argument: Like ‘information’, this is an atemporal mode. States of aﬀairs, facts, and\npropositions are introduced and related to each other, often contrastively.\n(2.33) The award was given to Paul, but he did not deserve it. His work is very shallow.\nEven though these correlations between text types and linguistic features are obviously\ntendencies rather than strict rules, they can serve as useful indicators, and Smith’s book (as well\nas the work of Werlich and others) discusses them in much more detail. Also, a computational\napproach to recognizing modes automatically was presented by Song et al. [2017]. Unfortu-\nnately, for our purposes here, the mode ‘argument’ is the most vague in the sense that it is less\ntightly connected to characteristic patterns than the others are. Still, as demonstrated by Becker\net al.[2016], it is possible to operationalize it for the purposes of recognizing argumentation.\nFollowing up on the huge body of linguistic research on aspectual verb classes, the authors focus\non one crucial feature for separating discourse modes, viz. the ‘situation entity (SE) types’. The\nfollowing types are distinguished.\n•State:Armin has brown eyes.\n•Event:Bonnie ate three tacos.\n•Report: The agency said applications had increased.\n•Generic sentence: Scientiﬁc papers make arguments.\n•Generalizing sentence: Fei travels to India every year.\n•Fact:Georg knows that Reza won the competition.\n•Proposition: Georg thinks that Reza won the competition.\n•Resemblance: Reza looks like he won the competition.\n•Question: Why do you torment me so?\n•Imperative: Listen to this.\nBecker et al. [2016] annotated these SE types in the texts of the ‘argumentative microtext’ cor-\npus ofPeldszus and Stede [2016b] and showed that the SE distribution can help distinguishing\nargumentative text passages from non-argumentative ones. Furthermore, Becker et al. demon-\nstrated that the distribution of SE types correlates with the diﬀerent types of argument compo-\nnent (premise/conclusion) and argumentative relations (support, attack).\n\n--- Page 38 ---\n2.6. RHETORIC 23\n2.6 RHETORIC\nAccording to the New Dictionary of the History of Ideas [Carron ,2005, p. 2122], “Rhetoric gov-\nerns the eﬀective use of verbal and nonverbal communication designed to inﬂuence an audience.\n…in its original and historical form, rhetoric is associated with the use of human discourse to\npersuade and can be deﬁned as the art of speaking, of speaking well, or of speaking eﬀectively\nwith the aim of persuading.” This clearly suggests a connection to argumentation, and indeed\nthis relationship was studied intensively by Aristotle, whom we mentioned in the ﬁrst chapter\nas the proponent of the three ‘means of persuasion’, logos, ethos, and pathos. For our purposes\nhere, the question is which aspects of language use can contribute to a text being argumenta-\ntivelyeﬀective, and we look brieﬂy at the two levels of linguistic description where rhetoric can\nunfold its power: the choices in building a sentence, and the organization of the text.\n2.6.1 BUILDING SENTENCES: RHETORICAL CHOICES\nWhen person A wants person B to close the window, there are many possibilities to formulate\nthe request; consider just two of them.\n(2.34) Close the window! It’s cold.\n(2.35) It is rather cold in here and I’m already not feeling so well. Would you be so kind to\nclose the window for me?\nIn both cases, we have a directive speech act and a justiﬁcation, but stated very diﬀerently.\nWhich one is more appropriate, and correspondingly, more eﬀective , of course depends very\nmuch on context: Who is talking to whom under what circumstances. This may seem trivial,\nbut the point is that a similar array of linguistic options for articulating a sentence is essentially\nalways at the writer’s disposal. We can choose rare and diﬃcult words, or common and simple\nones; we can speak or write in a long sequence of short sentences, or in a short sequence of com-\nplex, deeply structured sentences; and so forth. This borders on the notion of stylistics , where\nmany textbooks are available and some are probably known to the reader. More unusual are\napproaches that explicitly make the connection between rhetoric and grammar. Jeanne Fahne-\nstock’s introductory textbook [Fahnestock ,2011] gives vivid examples of how small changes in\nword choice, sentence construction, and passage construction can produce diﬀerent rhetorical\neﬀects. The introduction by Kolln[2003], centered around the notion of choice, also points to\nthe diﬀerent rhetorical eﬀects of each choice, and explains the alternatives by referring to gram-\nmatical concepts (rather than to intuition). To mention just one example, the author looks at\nthe correlation between lexical and grammatical decisions and the resulting intonation pattern\norrhythm of a sentence, which inﬂuences the perception by the hearer and the reader alike, and\ncan contribute to rhetorical eﬀects—or not, if bad choices have been made.\nRhetorical ﬁgures One phenomenon that is sometimes mentioned in connection with ar-\ngumentation is that of ﬁgures of speech, also called rhetorical ﬁgures, which have been studied\n\n--- Page 39 ---\n24 2. ARGUMENTATIVE LANGUAGE\nextensively in classical rhetoric. This, too, is a vast area, and we can only scratch the surface here.\nTwo such examples are as follows.\n•Hyperbole: Phew, the distance from Newark to Manhattan is a hundred miles!\nThe statement is literally false, but the exaggeration is consciously used (and probably\nunderstood) to emphasize the speaker’s point.\n•Tautology: That nice restaurant was really great.\nThe two predications on the restaurant are barely distinguishable; yet the repetition can\ncontribute to overall eﬀect.\nIn connection to argumentation, we point to the research eﬀorts of Harris and Di Marco [2017],\nwho have extensively analyzed rhetorical ﬁgures and studied many of them as devices for pro-\nducing eﬀective arguments. Following up on their work, Lawrence et al. [2017b] tried to detect\nthe presence of rhetorical ﬁgures in text automatically. They used the Moral Maze radio debate\ncorpus (see Section 3.6) for their experiments. For actually computing correlations with argu-\nmentative moves, the number of instances of rhetorical ﬁgures found was too small, however.\nMost recently, with an eye toward automation, Harris et al. [2018] proposed a new annotation\nscheme for Rhetorical Figures, using standoﬀ XML. They suggest focusing on computationally\ntractable ﬁgures such as antimetabole (reverse repetition of at least two words), which they map\nto several diﬀerent rhetorical functions.\n2.6.2 TEXT ORGANIZATION: RHETORICAL EFFECTS\nAs with sentences, the structure of a text is not arbitrary, either. There are many factors inﬂuenc-\ning the choices of how to order sentences and link them together, with an important one being\nthe genre of the text, which often suggests conventional linearizations. But usually, an author\nhas considerable room left for making choices, which in turn can contribute to rhetorical eﬀect.\nWe look at two alternative ways of capturing this: a ﬂat segmentation and labeling of a sequence\nof text spans, and the postulation of a hierarchical text structure.\nFunctional labels on text spans The idea that a text can be analyzed as a sequence of genre-\nspeciﬁc ‘moves’ goes back to Swales [1990], who suggested that a number of adjacent sentences\nconstitute such a move, and that the text then be a contiguous sequence of moves. Among the\ngenres studied was scientiﬁc writing, which (depending on the type of science) usually follows\nconventionalized patterns of ‘when to say what’ in a research paper (or in a grant proposal, a\nbook, etc.). A computational implementation was later proposed by Teufel and Moens [2002],\nwho coined the term ‘argumentative zoning’ for this approach. Teufel and colleagues annotated\npassagesofscientiﬁcpapersfortherolestheyplayasapartofthepaper’soverallcontribution,and\nhence,zonelabelsinclude‘aim’(researchgoal),‘own’(descriptionofauthor’swork),‘background’\n(generally accepted scientiﬁc background), ‘conclusion’, and several others. Having shown that\nsubstantial human annotator agreement can be achieved, the authors then trained automatic\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n2.6. RHETORIC 25\nclassiﬁers and demonstrated that the recognition of zone labels can be automated with quite\nimpressive quality.\nIn a similar vein, Yamada et al. [2017] studied legal arguments in Japanese court judg-\nments, and ran a human agreement study on labeling units as ‘identifying’ (setting a topic), ‘fact’,\n‘background’, ‘conclusion’, and ‘framing’ (argumentative material in support of the conclusion\nunit), and they obtained good annotator agreement (\u0014 =0.7).\nHierarchicaltextstructure Acomplementaryperspectiveontextstructuresuggeststhatatext\ncan be seen as a hierarchy of text spans that are (recursively) connected via so-called coherence\nrelations . These relations state that a span can, for example, be followed by another one that\nelaborates on the former, as in this example, where the spans are marked with square brackets.\n(2.36) Elaboration: [The new Smart Watch was introduced today.] [It costs $50 more than\nthe old model.]\nRecursion arises when these two segments in turn enter into a coherence relation, for example\nMotivation , which links a recommendation for the reader to the reason:\n(2.37) Motivation: [ [The new Smart Watch was introduced today.] [It costs $50 more than\nthe old model.] ] [You should really buy it.]\nA widely used corpus annotated with such coherence relations is the Penn Discourse Treebank\nor PDTB [ Prasad et al. ,2008]. Annotators inspected all the ‘boundaries’ in a text (roughly,\nclause and sentence boundaries) and decided whether some relation can be discerned between\nthe adjacent spans. The accompanying computational task of recognizing those relations is called\nShallow Discourse Parsing (for an introduction to the problem, see Stede[2011, Sct. 4.3]).\nIn the PDTB, the relations are being annotated independently of one another. Accord-\ningly, there are no assumptions on any overall structure that may arise. In contrast, Rhetorical\nStructure Theory or RST [ Mann and Thompson ,1988] postulates that a well-formed tree struc-\nture can be built, which spans the text completely.7The authors postulate that some 25 diﬀerent\ncoherence relations are suﬃcient for analyzing most texts. A sample RST tree (for an excerpt\nof a text) is shown in Figure 2.1. The best-known English RST corpus is the RST Discourse\nTreebank or RST-DT [ Carlson et al., 2003], and it has led to numerous proposals of auto-\nmatic parsers that try to build the tree structures automatically. Stede[2011, Sct. 4.4] gives an\noverview.\nEvidently, the analysis of argumentation is not entirely diﬀerent from the analyses in the\nPDTB and in the RST-DT. For RST, in particular, parallels between the tree structures and\nsimilar analyses of argumentation structure (recall the example shown in Figure 1.1) are easy\nto notice. However, there is no consensus yet as to how the relationship is to be construed ex-\nactly.

Section 4.2.2).\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n27\nC H A P T E R 3\nModeling Arguments\nIn this chapter we discuss structural models for arguments, as they have been proposed in the\nﬁeld of argumentation theory. Models describe the components of an argument, such as the\n‘standpoint’ in our deﬁnition from Section 1.1.1. Models diﬀer in how many components they\ndistinguish, and how they connect these components. Various names are used; we will generally\nrefer to the standpoint as aclaim. There is no single best model: Approaches to argumentation\ndepend on the type of text and the task. Argumentation theory itself is interdisciplinary, and\nargumentation mining has been inﬂuenced by rhetoric, informal logic, and formal logic.\nIn the following, we ﬁrst discuss argument components and structure (Section 3.1) and\nthen take a look at the way in which argumentation extends classical inference with defeasible\nreasoning (Section 3.2). Next we introduce the notion of argumentationscheme (Section 3.3) and\ntake a look at important types of argument models (Section 3.4). The chapter closes with a short\ndiscussion of early artiﬁcial intelligence approaches to representing arguments (Section 3.5), and\nan overview of argument mapping (Section 3.6) techniques.\n3.1 ARGUMENT COMPONENTS AND STRUCTURE\nMain components of arguments Earlier we said that that an argument consists of claims\nmadebythespeaker,alongwithmaterialtheypresentinsupportoftheirclaim,aswellaspossible\ncounter-considerations,andtheirrefutations.Wecanfurtherdeﬁnecertainterminologyusedfor\nargumentation structures. An argument structure is comprised of a constellation of propositions\nrelated to a claim(also called standpoint orconclusion), which is the proposition that the argument\nseeks to establish. Other propositions are used as premises , which are brought to bear, in support\nof the conclusion, and sometimes also to attackit. Any claim may play the role of ﬁnal conclusion\nof some argument, and any conclusion can be made into a premise supporting further reasoning.\nDiagramming arguments Diagramming can represent an argument’s structure. We saw one\nargument map in Figure 1.1on page 7. We will give further examples of argument maps in\nSection 3.6below.\nTypically, an argument map represents propositions with some geometric shape such as\ncircles and rectangles. Often there is no visual distinction between the proposition’s role in the\nargument, whether it serves as a top-level claim and ﬁnal conclusion or an intermediate one.\nText representing the proposition may appear directly in the diagram (as we will see in Fig-\nure3.7below) or may be referenced to a key (for instance Figure 1.1refers back to the text\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n28 3. MODELING ARGUMENTS\nin Example 1.6). Support and attack relationships between the propositions are distinguished\n(with diﬀerent line types, as in Figure 1.1, or using colors, as in Figure 3.7); sometimes only\nsupport or attack relationships are given.\nLinked, convergent, serial, divergent The structure of arguments, including the relation of\nargument components to one another can also be considered, as shown in Figure 3.1. Vari-\nous proposals have been made. The essential distinction is whether there are multiple distinct\npremises that each stand alone to support a claim (convergent), whether two reasons together\nstrengthen each other (linked), or whether a chain of reasoning is required where one premise\nsupports an interim conclusion, which is the premise of the next argument (e.g., if p, then q,\nif q then r; serial), or one premise that supports two or more conclusions (divergent). Some\ngraphsandexamplesareshowncompactlyin WeiandPrakken [2012].Also, Henkemans [2000]\nsurveys historical approaches and enduring philosophical questions about distinguishing these\nstructure types. Subtleties do arise; for instance, Grennan [1997, pp. 71-72], “[S]ome arguments\ncontain assertions that have a bearing on conclusion support but are not direct evidence for the\nconclusion.” This is an issue of relevance of conclusions, related to the knowledge of the hearer.\nA\nBA A A\nBA B B\nC C\nCC B\n(iv)\nSerial(i)\nSingle(ii)\nLinked(iii)\nConvergent(v)\nDivergent\nFigure 3.1: Common basic argument structures based on Rahwan [2008].\nGranularity Arguments are recursive, zippered structures. The conclusion of one argument\nmay be the premise of the next argument, building a more complex tree. Wyner et al. distin-\nguish between three diﬀerent kinds of argument based on the features of this tree: an Argument\n(capital A) that cannot be subdivided into any other parts that are still arguments (“a one-step\nreason for a claim”); a Case, with only supporting evidence for a claim (“a chain of reasoning\nleading toward a claim”); and a Debate which has both supporting and conﬂicting evidence\n(“reasons for and against a claim (Debate)”) [Wyner et al. ,2015, p. 51].\nWhen we want to think about the internal structure of the argument, this distinction is\nhelpful. The internal structure of an Argument of this sort is just made up of the components we\n\n--- Page 44 ---\n3.2. ARGUMENTATION EXTENDS CLASSICAL INFERENCE 29\ndiscussed above. By contrast, a Case must have multiple inference steps, but without any attacks\non the central claim. And the Debate can be broken into two Cases: one for the claim and one\nagainst it.\n3.2 ARGUMENTATION EXTENDS CLASSICAL\nINFERENCE WITH DEFEASIBLE REASONING\nArgumentation extends classical inference, enabling tentative conclusions. By contrast, in clas-\nsical logic, the conclusion is guaranteed to hold whenever the premises hold, using classical in-\nference rules.\nDefeasibility Argumentation is defeasible: it considers tentative conclusions, which can be\nrevised when new information comes to light. That is, argumentation admits belief revision, is\ndefeasible , and follows a non-monotonic logic. See Koons [2017] for more on defeasible reasoning.\nClassical inference rules In classical logic, however, the conclusion is guaranteed to hold\nwhenever the premises hold, using classicalinferencerules, such as syllogism, modus ponens, and\nmodus tollens.\nAsyllogism derives a conclusion via inference from two premises which share a related\nterm. For example:\n(3.1) Socrates is a man; ( Minor premise )\nEvery man is mortal; ( Major premise )\nTherefore, Socrates is mortal. (Conclusion)\nA syllogism’s premises are called minor and major. This distinction is based on which term they\ncontain; the minor term is identiﬁed by the subject (‘Socrates’) of the conclusion while the major\nterm is identiﬁed by the predicate (‘mortal’) of the conclusion.\nThe rule modusponens enables deriving the consequent,or right-hand side of a conditional:\n(3.2) Given if p, then q.\nGiven p.\nTherefore, q.\nThe rule modus tollens enables ruling out the antecedent, or left-hand side of a conditional:\n(3.3) Given if p, then q.\nGiven not q.\nTherefore, not p.\nSeePrior[2006] for further examples. Argumentation theory has collected its own\nschemes, which can be considered as defeasible rules of inference. We discuss those next.\n\n--- Page 45 ---\n30 3. MODELING ARGUMENTS\n3.3 ARGUMENTATION SCHEMES\nArgumentation schemes are patterns of everyday reasoning made up of propositions, a defeasible\ninference rule with the propositions as premises, and a conclusion (a proposition) inferred from\nthe rule using the propositions.\nAn argumentation scheme expresses a defeasible inference rule for showing the accept-\nability of a standpoint. Various treatments of argumentation schemes, highlighting diﬀerent\naspects, have been given, with wide variation in the number of schemes. A recent and authori-\ntative overview of inﬂuential approaches can be found in Walton et al. [2018].\nWalton’s argumentation schemes Walton, Reed, and Macagno’s Compendium of Schemes\ncollects 60 schemes, along with critical questions that identify the potential points of weakness\nin an argument [Walton et al. ,2008]. One such scheme is Position to Know.\nMajor Premise: Source ais in a position to know about things in a certain subject domain\nScontaining proposition A.\nMinor Premise :aasserts that A(in Domain S) is true (false).\nConclusion: Ais true (false).\nThey list three critical questions.\n1. Is ain a position to know whether Ais true (false)?\n2. Is aan honest (trustworthy, reliable) source?\n3. Did aassert that Ais true (false)?\nNote here that the structure of diﬀerent premises may need to be distinguished, e.g., the mi-\nnor premise “serves as independent evidence or support for the conclusion” whereas the major\npremise does not [Grennan, 1997, p. 75].\nPragma-dialectic argumentation schemes The classical pragma-dialectic approach classiﬁes\nschemes into three types: sign, comparison, and cause [Hitchcock and Wagemans, 2011]. As\na prototypical example, the “argument from comparison” scheme compares two situations and\nuses their similarity as a justiﬁcation. Analyzing “It’s not at all necessary to give James 10 dollars\nallowance, because his brother always got just 5 dollars a week.” Hitchcock and Wagemans\n[2011, p. 187] write:\n1James (X) does not need 10 dollars a week (Y).\n1:1James’ brother (Z) did not need 10 dollars a week (Y).\n1:10James (X) is similar to James’ brother with respect to the sum needed for their weekly\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n3.4. TYPES OF ARGUMENT MODELS 31\nallowance\nalong with three critical questions for the comparison scheme:\n1. Are the things that are compared actually comparable?\n2. Are there enough relevant similarities between the things that are compared?\n3. Are there any relevant diﬀerences between the things that are compared?\nTheothertwomainpragma-dialecticschemes,signandcause,havesimilarconsiderations;\nvariants and subtypes of each of the three types are recognized.\nArgumentum model of topics Rigotti and Morasso’s Argumentum Model of Topics\n(AMT) [Rigotti and Greco Morasso, 2010] draws on the study of topoiandloci, from ancient\nand medieval rhetoric. (See also Rapp[2010, Section 7].) The name of a scheme, such as cause-\neﬀect or analogy, is only the ﬁrst level: the procedural starting point. At the second level, certain\ninference patterns that Rigotti and Morasso call ‘maxims’ are needed. In the third level, each of\nthese maxims activates a rule, such as modus ponens or modus tollens. An example maxim is\nthe following [Rigotti and Greco Morasso ,2010, p. 495].\n1. If a certain goal is to be achieved, it is reasonable to activate a cause chain allowing to reach\nit.\n2. If no causal chain is available, the goal cannot be achieved.\n3. If a certain behavior is not oriented toward a goal (as it cannot be considered a proper\nhuman action), it cannot be endowed with any property typically congruous with human\naction (responsibility, merit, guilt, and so on).\nSemantic analysis is used to ﬁll the gap between the scheme type and the maxim. For\ninstance, in the AMT analysis shown in Figure 3.2, an assumption in the audience’s common\nground (‘endoxon’, following Aristotle) is made explicit, namely that the national holiday and\nNew Year’s Eve are comparable (“belong to the same functional genus”). Their approach is more\nﬁne-grainedthanothers,sinceaparticularmaximmustbespeciﬁedanditsapplicabilityjustiﬁed.\n3.4 TYPES OF ARGUMENT MODELS\nBentahar, Moulin, and Bélanger classify argumentation models into rhetorical models, dialogi-\ncal models, and monological models [ Bentahar et al., 2010]. These types of models are comple-\nmentary, each coming from diﬀerent perspectives, as shown in Table 3.1. Monological models\nview arguments as tentative proofs, and link premises and claims to describe the microstructure:\nthe internal inference structure of each argument. Rhetorical models view arguments based on\nan audience’s perception, and link whole arguments in a rhetorical structure emphasizing the\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n32 3.

Finally, dialogical models view arguments through the lens\nof defeasible reasoning and link whole arguments in a macrostructure: the dialogical structure.\nNext, we will cover some prototypical models exemplifying the monological, rhetorical,\nand dialogical perspectives.\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n3.4.

We also discuss the IBIS model, which does not ﬁt neatly into these three\ntypes.\nToulmin model One of the most inﬂuential models of argumentation, the Toulmin model,\nwas ﬁrst proposed by British philosopher Stephen Toulmin in 1958. This model takes a mono-\nlogicalviewofargumentation,focusingontheinternalstructureofanargument,whichisviewed\nas a tentative proof. The Toulmin model has a detailed internal structure, as shown in Figure 3.3.\nIn the model, a claim is defeasibly supported by its grounds (also called the data), according to\nsome warrant. If necessary, the warrant may be further supported by a backing. Qualiﬁers or\nrebuttals can also be diagrammed, but are not required.\nIn Figure 3.3, the claim is “Anne now has red hair”. Its grounds is “Anne is one of Jack’s\nsisters”. Its warrant is “any sister of Jack’s may be taken to have red hair”, which has the backing,\n“All his sisters have previously been observed to have red hair.” Its qualiﬁer is “presumably”. Its\nrebuttal is “unless Anne has dyed/ gone white/ lost her hair...”.\nArgument mapping and education have been among the areas inﬂuenced by the Toul-\nmin model. Furthermore, it has been taken up in Computational Linguistics and—with\nmodiﬁcations—used for annotating texts by Habernal and Gurevych [2017]; we will introduce\nthat work in the next chapters.\nThe New Rhetoric Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s 1969 book The New Rhetoric: A Treatise\nonArgumentation has been very inﬂuential. It takes persuasion and audience as central concerns:\n\n--- Page 49 ---\n34 3. MODELING ARGUMENTS\nAnne is one of\nJack’s sistersAnne now has\nred hair\nSince\nAny sister of Jack’s\nmay be taken to have\nred hair\nOn account of the fact that\nAll his sisters have\npreviously been observed to have red hairUnless\nAnne has dyed/gone\nwhite/lost her hair…So, presumably } {\nFigure 3.3: Sample Toulmin diagram based on Toulmin [2008].\nargumentation, in their view, cannot be reduced to formal defeasible logic. Rather, arguments\nseek to persuade a given audience, or to convince the universal audience. Argumentation is thus\na persuasive act involving two or more interlocutors, and it is “relative to the audience to be\ninﬂuenced” [Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969, p. 19]. From this perspective, “The goal of\nall argumentation...is to create or increase the adherence of minds to the theses presented for\ntheir assent.” [Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca, 1969, p. 45]. We can describe this as a rhetorical\napproach to argumentation.\nDung’sargumentationframeworks Dung’s inﬂuential 1995 paper [ Dung, 1995] models the\nattack structure between arguments. Dung is not concerned with the internal structure of the\nargument or with support relationships: this is a macroscopic, dialogical view of argumentation\nin which constellations of arguments are evaluated based on defeasible reasoning.\nAn argumentation framework is a directed graph whose nodes represent arguments and\nwhose edges represent relationships between arguments. More formally, Dung deﬁnes an ar-\ngument framework as a pair hS;attacksi where Sis a set of arguments and attacks is a binary\nrelationship on the arguments contained in S\u0002S.\nAll arguments are considered to have the same strength and each attack is considered to\nbe successful, unless it is in turn attacked. For instance, in Figure 3.4,Aattacks BandBattacks\nC. In this situation, it is not coherent to accept both Band either its attacker (A) or what it\nattacks ( B). More formally, acceptability involves means ﬁnding a subset which is conﬂict-free\nand collectively defends itself. A set Sdefends an argument aif for any argument bthat attacks\na,Scontains an argument that attacks b. An argument aisacceptable with respect to the set\nthat defends it.\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n3.5. EARLY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPROACHES 35\nA B C\nFigure 3.4: In this sample Dungian argumentation framework, A attacks B and B attacks C.\nThe acceptable sets are: ;;fAg;fBg;fCg;fA; Cg.\nSolvers for Dungian argumentation frameworks can compute the subsets (extensions ) sat-\nisfying some property. In general, semantics (e.g., credulous ,skeptical ) are used to determine\nwhich coherent sets of arguments are jointly acceptable .\nA number of formal argumentation approaches are modiﬁed from Dung’s framework.\nModiﬁcations may involve using probabilities or values to evaluate argument strength, or ad-\nditional node types, or additional edge types. Several of these are being used to evaluate the\nacceptability of manually and automatically mined arguments, including bipolar argumentation\nframeworks , which allow support as well as attack; abstract dialectical frameworks , where each\nnode gets its own acceptance condition; and the aforementioned Quantitative Argumentation\nDebate (QuAD) framework. These will be discussed when we present examples applying solvers\nin Section 8.3.1.\nIBIS model Not all models ﬁt neatly into Bentahar’s taxonomy. For instance, the IBIS\nmodel—Issue-Based Information Systems—was proposed in 1970 as a coordination and doc-\numentation system for political decision-making such as in urban planning [ Kunz and Rittel ,\n1970]. It is a process for turning an unstructured problem (a controversial topic in a particular\ncontext) into a decision. Parts of the controversial topic are framed as issues—questions that can\nbe debated with arguments either pro or con. Questionsoffact can reference external information.\nIBIShasinspirednumeroussystems,includingarecentcomputationalargumentationfor-\nmalism called the Quantitative Argumentation Debate (QuAD) framework [Baroni et al., 2015]\nwhich connects issues with questions, answers, pros, and cons. QuAD frameworks can be evalu-\nated with the Arg&Dec tool1[Aurisicchio et al. ,2015], which we will return to in Section 8.3.1.\n3.5 EARLY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPROACHES\nTO REPRESENTING ARGUMENTS\nWe now discuss two examples of classical artiﬁcial intelligence approaches to representing ar-\nguments from the 1980’s and 1990’s.\nRobin Cohen One of the earliest approaches to argumentation and natural language was\nRobin Cohen’s 1983 dissertation [Cohen, 1983], which focuses on understanding argumen-\n1http://www.arganddec.com (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n36 3. MODELING ARGUMENTS\ntative monologues by reconstructing their structure, as claim and evidence relations between\npropositions supporting a single main point. Cohen relies on discourse coherence and proposes\ncue words and metadiscourse used in arguing. The system focuses on “everyday arguments” [ Co-\nhen,1983, p. 12], leaving aside quality and credibility judgments of logical validity.\nViewing an argument as a tree in which each claim is the parent of its evidence, Cohen\n[1987] presents a design for an argument understanding system. To determine where a propo-\nsition ﬁts, Cohen uses three main considerations: coherence, cue words, and intended support\nrelationships (that the hearer might not believe) in order to restrict the search space. Examples\nof Cohen’s cue words (“linguistic clues”) are shown in Figure 3.5.\nP is prior proposition; S is the proposition with the clue\nCategory Relation: P to S Example\nparallel  brother   First, Second\ninference son   As a result\ndetail  father   In particular\nsummary multiple sons  In sum\nreformulation son (& father)  In other words\ncontrast brother or father On the other hand\nFigure 3.5: Cohen’s semantic classes for clue interpretation based on Cohen [1987].\nArgument units OpEd—an early question-answering system—used what were called ‘Argu-\nment Units’ such as the one shown in Figure 3.6. These “represent patterns of support and attack\nrelationships among beliefs” [ Alvarado ,1990, p. 9]. The clearest treatment is found in Chap-\nter 4 of Alvarado [1990]. “AUs encode language-free and domain-free knowledge which can be\ninstantiated to argue about plans in any domain” (p. 119).\n3.6 ARGUMENT MAPPING\nArgument maps are diagrams used to help make sense of complex arguments. An argument\nmap separates arguments into the various components. Such maps have been manually con-\nstructed for 150 years, particularly in philosophy, and came into legal argumentation in the early\n20th century [Walton, 2005]. Argument maps can show the big picture—which is sometimes\nquite big, such as Robert Horns’ large-scale map of the artiﬁcial intelligence debate. Titled “Can\nComputers Think?”, and exploring 50 years of philosophical argument, the map spreads over 7\nposter-size pages and covers over 800 arguments presented by more than 300 people2[Horn,\n2003].\n2http://debategraph.org/Details.aspx?nid=75 (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n3.6.

Interpretation decisions need to be made when mapping a typical text, based in part on\nhow explicit and coherent the text is. Argument maps may also be constructed in the process\nof writing a document. For example, the argument map shown in Figure 3.7was created by\nSebastian Cacean and Gregor Betz [ Betz and Cacean, 2012a]3while writing a report for the\nGerman Ministry of Education and Research about ethical aspects of climate engineering [Betz\nand Cacean, 2012a].

Arrows in the ﬁgure indicate\nsupport (green) and attack (red) relationships between theses and arguments or pairs of argu-\nments. Subarguments are collected together in dashed boxes. The inset in Figure 3.7shows part\nof the “ethics of risk” subargument.\n3.6.1 APPLICATIONS OF ARGUMENT MAPPING\nArgument maps have been used in a variety of applications. Dialogue mapping is an approach to\ngroup deliberation that iteratively develops argument maps during a meeting [ Conklin, 2006].\nTim Van Gelder reports that argument maps both encode knowledge and make it “readily re-\ncoverable for anyone in the future” [ Van Gelder ,2003, p. 114]. These maps make the arguments\nand their counterarguments visible all at once, which can help with decision-making and can\nhelp retain and revisit the rationale for a previously taken decision. Such maps also make it pos-\nsible to see more of an argument than the average person can hold in their head at one time,\nmaking it possible to think more critically and with more detachment from a particular way of\nexpressing a claim or rationale or a particular speaker who put it forward [Van Gelder, 2003]. In\nparticular, with external maps “it is safer to make a case against an idea because it isn’t an attack\non the person who suggested it” [Conklin, 2006, p. 175].\nStructured arguments are used to construct safety cases or assurance cases for critical in-\ndustries such as nuclear plants, airplanes, trains, automobiles, and medical devices; for examples,\nseeRinehart et al. [2015, pp. 23-62]. Several diﬀerent argument mapping structures are used\n[Rinehart et al., 2015], including the Goal Structuring Notation [ Spriggs, 2012] (speciﬁed in a\n2011standard[Attwoodetal., 2011]),theClaims-Argument-Evidencegraphicalformat,which\nlinks evidence to claims based on some sort of inference structure, which CAE refers to as the\n‘argument’, or sometimes ‘argument approach’ [Bishop and Bloomﬁeld, 1998].4\nRecently, live radio debates have been mapped in real-time by a team at the University\nof Dundee. On the British Broadcasting Corporation radio program Moral Maze, panelists\ndebate ethical issues related to a recent news story. Using a touch screen they call the Argument\nAnalysisWall [ Bex et al. ,2013], a team of argumentation analysts have collaborated to map radio\ndebates as shown in Figure 3.8. The process starts with real-time transcripts, which are chunked\ninto components by segmentation analysts, and then a team of 8 analysts have connected these\ncomponents into supporting and conﬂicting arguments [Bex et al., 2013].5\nArgument maps were used to express stakeholders’ opinions, based on interviews and\nsurveys in the EcoBioCap project [ Tamani et al., 2014]. A map of the relationship between\n11 arguments around food packaging was developed using data from interviews and surveys of\nstakeholders. Besides conﬂicts and attacks, the system considers preferences, which it resolves\n4https://www.adelard.com/asce/choosing-asce/cae.html (accessed May 28, 2018).\n5For a video of the process, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iELLjHAjEc (accessed May 28, 2018).

We will return to computational rea-\nsoning systems in Section 8.3.1.\nArgument maps also have a potential use in medical decision-making. Typically, argu-\nment maps have been made from text. Data tables that have come from text can also be seen as\na starting point. Hunter and Williams have modeled medical evidence from published clinical\nguidelines for treatments for 3 conditions—glaucoma, hypertension, and hypertension during\npregnancy [ Hunter and Williams ,2012]. They use argument maps to connect pairs of possi-\n\n--- Page 56 ---\n3.6. ARGUMENT MAPPING 41\nble treatment options: arrows in the graph go from the preferred treatment to the disprefered\ntreatment, functioning as attack relations. They deﬁne a formal semantics over the graph and\ncalculate overall preferred treatments (a ‘superiority graph’) given up to 25 treatment pairs. A\ntutorial [Hunter and Williams, 2015] further explains their approach. Noor et al. [2017] take\nan analogous approach for reasoning about side eﬀects and experiences, using argument graphs\ndeveloped from patients’ reviews on medical forums.\n3.6.2 ARGUMENT MAPPING TOOLS\nNumerous tools for argument mapping are available. While even explicitly mapping an argu-\nment on paper can enable a clearer understanding of a topic, many computational tools oﬀer\nadditional computational support such as calculating the consistent results as we will discuss in\nSection 8.3.1.\nNext, we brieﬂy review seven representative argument mapping tools; this is just a small\nselection of a diverse and crowded ﬁeld of tools. For more comprehensive reviews of tools,\nseeScheuer et al. [2010], which covers computer-supported learning, and Schneider et al.\n[2013a] which focuses on web-based tools.\n• AGORA-net6[Hoﬀmann, 2011] is free, collaborative web-based argument visualization\nsoftware that aims to help people recognize good reasoning. The system provides four\nargument schemes: modus ponens, modus tollens, disjunctive syllogism, and not-all syl-\nlogism. Sample maps can be viewed online with Adobe Flash. Its creator characterizes\nthe underlying method as “requir[ing] logical validity as a normative standard for the con-\nstruction of arguments” [Hoﬀmann, 2011, p. 151]. Curriculum development has been a\nfocus of the project; for instance AGORA-net has been used to teach engineering ethics\nin Russian Universities and the software is available in ﬁve common world languages.\n• The Adelard Safety Case Editor (ASCE)7[Emmet and Cleland ,2002] is primarily used\nin safety assurance, and can use the common formats of Goal Structuring Notation and\nClaims-Argument-Evidence.\n• Argunet8[Schneider et al., 2007] is an open source (GNU General Public License v2)\ncross-platform editor that can be used as standalone system or with a shared server.

MODELING ARGUMENTS\n• Compendium9[Shum et al. ,2006] is a widely adopted tool designed for dialogue map-\nping. It follows Issue-Based Information Systems [Kunz and Rittel ,1970] in distinguish-\ning issues and position nodes, and adds additional types such as questions, references, and\nnotes to create a rich hypertext network. Its online sibling Cohere10[Buckingham Shum,\n2008] focuses on marking connections between pairs of ideas, which can then be visual-\nized in a larger graph. Cohere has a rich selection of connections, including both negative\n(‘challenges’, ‘is inconsistent with’, ‘refutes’) and positive (‘causes’, ‘improves on’, ‘is a value\nof’, ‘is an example of’, ‘is analogous to’, ‘is consistent with’, ‘predicts’, and ‘proves’), and can\nfunction as a bookmarking tool using the Cohere Firefox plugin. Both use the lesser GNU\npublic license.\n• DebateGraph11is an online mapping tool that has been used by media organizations to\nhelp users browse complex ideas, integrated with rich media. Maps can be viewed graph-\nically or in outline format. Its main types are issues, positions, supportive arguments, and\nopposing arguments.\n• Online Visualization of Argument (OVA)12[Snaith et al. ,2010] facilitates analysis of web\npages. Various semantics can be automatically applied to compute winning/losing argu-\nments. It has been adapted into OVA+ [Janier et al. ,2014] to provide particular support\nfor a dialogue-based argument annotation system called Inference Anchoring Theory (see\nSection 4.1, page 50).\n• Rationale13[Van Gelder, 2007] and its cousin bCisive14are commercial argument map-\nping tools created by the Australian Austhink company and overseen by the Dutch parent\ncompany Critical Thinking Skills BV. Rationale is an online system focused on teaching\ncritical thinking as well as essay writing while bCisive is designed for business decision\nmaking. Maps can be public or private. Diﬀerent types of argument maps are supported;\nfor instance, in writing-oriented maps concepts might connected with words such as but,\nhowever, and because.\n3.6.3 FORMALIZING, SHARING, AND QUERYING ARGUMENT MAPS\nWith so many diﬀerent argument mapping tools, approaches for sharing argument maps are\nneeded. The best known format for sharing between computer tools is called the Argument In-\nterchange Format (AIF). AIF is intended as a XML representation of key argumentation com-\nponents. It is extensible, and has been used for formalizing, storing and sharing, and querying\nargument maps.\n9https://github.com/CompendiumNG/CompendiumNG (accessed May 28, 2018).\n10http://cohere.open.ac.uk/ (accessed May 28, 2018).\n11http://debategraph.org/ (accessed May 28, 2018).\n12http://ova.arg-tech.org (accessed May 28, 2018).\n13https://www.rationaleonline.com (accessed May 28, 2018).\n14https://www.bcisiveonline.com (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 58 ---\n3.6. ARGUMENT MAPPING 43\nFormalizing argument maps for interchange Argument Interchange Format is a formal\nmodel—an ontology—introduced by an international group in 2006 [ Chesñevar et al. ,2006]\nto model the argument networks, communication locutions, and protocols for interchange be-\ntween two participants or two software packages, and contexts such as agents and theories. AIF\nhas provided a technological foundation for various experimental systems for supporting argu-\nmentation on the Web, such as ArgDF [Zablith ,2007] and argument blogging [ Wells et al.,\n2009], as well as an interchange format for some of the argumentation mapping tools described\nabove.\nAIF core ontology includes information nodes (I-nodes) and scheme application nodes\n(S-nodes). Multiple extensions have been made to the original, core ontology. For instance, in\n2007,Rahwan et al. [2007] added Form Nodes, which enables argumentation schemes (see Sec-\ntion3.3) to be directly modeled within the graph. The AIF+ extension distinguishes between\nlocutions and their propositional content, catering for dialogue and dialogue games [Reed et al.,\n2008b], and has been extensively used by the work of the Dundee group. Another recent ex-\ntension, targeting social web discussions, adds Personal, Faction, Audience, Personal Support,\nPersonal Conﬂict, and Implication nodes [Blount et al. ,2016].\nStoring and sharing AIFdb provides a database implementation of AIF [Lawrence et al. ,\n2012]. In practice, AIFdb is not just a database for storing but also a web interface providing\nworldwide-shared access to AIF-formatted data. Currently, a number of corpora, including the\nAraucaria database [ Katzav et al. ,2003] used for early argumentation mining work, have been\ntranslated into AIF and published online15[Lawrence et al., 2012]. Reed et al. [2017] reports\nthat the current database stores 70 corpora containing 11,000 arguments (60,000 claims; 1.2\nmillion words), with source materials in 14 diﬀerent languages, with a variety of diﬀerent scripts.\nWe will discuss corpora further in Chapter 4.\nQuerying Complex queries are possible from arguments expressed in AIF. A higher-level\nquery language called ArgQL uses the Resource Description Framework representation of AIF\nto deﬁne queries using the SPARQL standard, for instance “Find arguments which ‘defend’\n(attack their attackers) all arguments with conclusion ‘cloning is immoral’.” [ Zograﬁstou et al.,\n2017] or “Match pairs of arguments whose premise sets join each other.” ArgQL enables users to\ndirectly query for Argument, Debate Graph, Path, Attack, Support, Rebut, Undercut, Endorse,\nand Back, or any combinations.\n15http://corpora.aifdb.org/index.php (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 59 ---\n45\nC H A P T E R 4\nCorpus Annotation\nAs in other branches of natural language processing, the majority of research on argumentation\nmining is based on corpora, and usually on annotated corpora. Creating them has therefore been\na focus of interest in the years around 2015 when the ﬁeld gained momentum. In this chapter,\nwe ﬁrst describe some relatively generic annotation schemes1that have been suggested and used\nfor corpus annotation (Section 4.1), and then we provide brief descriptions of some corpora that\nhave been made freely available to the research community (Section 4.2). There is some overlap,\nas several of these corpora use schemes we describe in Section 4.1, but for most corpora there\nare separate, purpose-speciﬁc schemes being used.\n4.1 ANNOTATION SCHEMES\nThe general considerations on the structure of argumentation, such as those outlined in the\nprevious chapter, have been translated in various ways into schemes for annotating instances of\narguments found in text. In the following, we present some schemes that have been used for\ncorpus annotation. As they were devised with diﬀerent applications and purposes in mind, the\nreader should be prepared for some notable diﬀerences between the various approaches.\nThemicrotextscheme Following up on early pilot studies by Stede and Sauermann [2008], a\ntree-oriented annotation scheme was proposed by Peldszus and Stede [2013]. It is inspired by\nthe work of Freeman [1991, 2011], whose perspective on argumentation is that of a hypothet-\nical dialectical exchange between the proponent, who presents and defends his claims, and the\nopponent , who critically questions (‘attacks’) them in a regimented fashion. Every move in such\nan exchange corresponds to a structural element in the argumentation tree.\nThe argumentation structure annotation scheme then distinguishes between simple sup-\nport (one ADU provides a justiﬁcation of another) and linkedsupport, where several ADUs\ncollectively fulﬁll the role of justiﬁcation; in other words, one of the ADUs in isolation would\nnot be suﬃcient to perform the support. (This distinction was also made by Rahwan [2008]\nin the basic constellations shown earlier in Figure 3.1.) On the side of attacks, the annotation\nscheme separates rebutting (denying the validity of a statement) and undercutting (denying the\nrelevance of a statement in supporting another).2The annotation scheme is designed in such a\n1There is a slightly unfortunate parallel between the terms ‘argumentation scheme’, as used for instance in Chapter 3and\n‘annotation scheme’, but we see no way of avoiding one or the other term here.\n2For illustration, see Examples 6.6and6.7on page 86.\n\n--- Page 60 ---\n46 4. CORPUS ANNOTATION\nway that the ﬁne-grained representations may also be reduced to coarser ones that, for example,\nonly distinguish between support and attack, as it is customary in most other schemes.\nIn Figure 4.1, we show the representation for a short sample text. The nodes of this tree\nrepresent the propositions expressed in text segments (grey boxes), and their shape indicates the\nrole in the dialectical exchange: round nodes are the proponent’s nodes, square ones are the op-\nponent’s nodes. The arcs connecting the nodes represent diﬀerent supporting (arrow-head links)\nand attacking moves (circle/square-head links): 3 undercuts the attack of 2 on 1; 4 and 5 perform\na linked support on 1. By means of recursive application of relations, representations of relatively\ncomplex texts can be created, identifying the central claim of a text, supporting premises, pos-\nsible objections, and their counter-objections, with potential sub-structures involved in various\nplaces. As one example, ‘serial support’ originates when one segment supports another one,\nwhich in turn supports a third segment (see also Figure 3.1).\nThis annotation scheme is described in detail in Peldszus and Stede [2013], where il-\nlustrative examples for the various relevant constellations are given. It was encoded in speciﬁc\nannotation guidelines, and has been applied to German texts from the ‘Potsdam Commentary\nCorpus’ [Stede and Neumann, 2014], and to the German/English ‘microtext’ corpus (see the\nnext section). A dedicated, web-based annotation tool was developed for building tree struc-\ntures over text spans.3As for inter-annotator agreement, Peldszus [2014] reports \u0014=0.83 for\nwell-trained expert annotators that start from pre-segmented text.\nThe persuasive essay scheme The annotation scheme underlying the persuasive essay corpus\nbyStab and Gurevych [2014a] (see the next section) shares the basic idea of building a claim-\nrooted tree with the microtext scheme. There are a few diﬀerences, though. The ﬁrst results from\nthe genre: Each persuasive essay, according to the scheme, has one segment called the major\nclaim, which is the thesis that the essay argues for. It tends to be found in the ﬁrst paragraph of\nthe essay. Independently of that, claim/premise trees are annotated on the level of paragraphs,\ni.e., one tree is built for each paragraph of an essay.\nWhile there are no explicit proponent/opponent labels, the relation between premise and\nclaim has to be labeled as either support or attack, which therefore also implicitly captures the\ndiﬀerence in the roles of segments. This annotation scheme does not distinguish any further\nsubcategories of support or attack. The reported inter-annotator agreement in terms of Krip-\npendorf’s unitized \u000bis 0.72 for argument components and 0.81 for relations.\nThe science scheme Kirschner et al. [2015] addressed a genre that, somewhat surprisingly,\nso far has not received very much attention in the argumentation mining community: scientiﬁc\npapers, in particular journal papers from educational research. A pilot study was performed on\n24 papers (in German), with an average length of about 10 pages.\nThe argumentative units are always sentences, and they are not labeled with roles. Four\nrelations are used to link the units: Support and Attack on the one hand, and Sequence and\n3http://angcl.ling.uni-potsdam.de/resources/grapat.html (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 61 ---\n4.1.

The latter are inspired from theories of discourse structure (cf. Section 2.6):\nDetail is used when “A is a detail of B and gives more information or deﬁnes something stated in\nB without argumentative reasoning” [ Kirschner et al. ,2015, p. 5], and Sequence applies when\n“two (or more) argument components belong together and only make sense in combination” (p.\n5). For illustration, Figure 4.2shows a sample analysis of an argument along these lines. An\ninteresting contribution of the work is a proposal for a new way of measuring inter-annotator\nagreement for graphs.—In general, however, it is not clear whether the authors indeed require\nthe full power of graphs for their representations or whether trees are in fact suﬃcient.\nThe Modiﬁed Toulmin Scheme In selecting a scheme for annotating their corpus of user-\ngenerated web discourse (see next section), Habernal and Gurevych [2017] started from the\nToulmin model (see Section 3.4.1). They kept its basic assumption that the argumentative role\nof a unit fully determines its position in the argument representation—and thus the scheme\nhas no need to explicitly annotate any relations between units. In contrast to the microtext and\npersuasiveessayschemes,itishencenotpossibletobuildrecursivestructures(asneededfor‘serial\nsupport’ or complex counter-attack constellations). The annotation therefore is a ﬂat labeling;\nan example is shown in Figure 4.3.\n\n--- Page 63 ---\n4.1. ANNOTATION SCHEMES 49\nFigure 4.3: Diagrammatic representation of annotated argument in the Modiﬁed Toulmin\nScheme based on Habernal and Gurevych [2017, p. 144].\nHowever, Habernal and Gurevych did make a number of important modiﬁcations to the\noriginalToulminmodel.TheyremovedtheQualiﬁerandtheWarrant,asthesedidnotplayarole\nin their corpus data. The notion of Backing was slightly redeﬁned and now serves as ‘additional\nevidence’, which does not play the same role as a premise but still lends overall support to the\nargument. In order to account for counter-attacks, they introduce the unit type Refutation . And\nﬁnally, to enable the annotation of texts where the claim is not explicit (which is often the case\nin their corpus), annotators were instructed to add an explicit statement of the author’s stance,\nas they infer it from the text.\nSince the annotation process consists of breaking the text into units and labeling them,\nannotator agreement was evaluated in terms of Krippendorﬀ’s unitized \u000b; an overall value of\n0.48 was achieved. Habernal and Gurevych [2017] provide an in-depth analysis of the various\ntypes of disagreement that they found.\nThe Cornell eRulemaking Scheme While the majority of annotations on argumentative\nmonologue text use trees, this is not entirely uncontroversial. Recently, Niculae et al. [2017]\nreleased a corpus of user comments on government rule making.4The authors argue that those\ntexts are less ‘well-formed’ than those in, e.g., the microtext or the persuasive essay corpus, and\nthat trees are not powerful enough to represent the structures adequately. Figure 4.4shows a\nsample text and annotation, where unit csupports two other units, and furthermore there is no\nsingle root (claim).5The authors report that 20% of the comments in the corpus give rise to such\n4The source website is http://regulationroom.org, and the corpus is available at http://joonsuk.org (accessed May\n28, 2018).\n5The support relation from ctoaresults from automatically adding the transitive closure over the links.\n\n--- Page 64 ---\n50 4.

Relation types are reasonandevidence .\nNiculae et al. report annotator agreement in terms of Krippendorﬀ’s \u000b: 0.65 for role as-\nsignment, and 0.44 for linking.\nInference Anchoring Theory Inference Anchoring Theory (IAT) concerns what Asher and\nLascarides [2003] called ‘dialogue glue’: the connections between utterances in dialogue, and\nthe locutions put forward by these utterances. To describe the argumentative connections, IAT\nproposes illocutionary schemes that describe how speech acts are performed in dialogue. Exam-\nple illocutionary schemes (see, e.g., Reed[2011]) are analogous to the argumentation schemes\nwe discussed in Section 3.3, but they connect locutions to the logical arguments that they put\nforward. Their main elements are transitions between statements, indicating the illocutionary\nforce (e.g., asserting, challenging, questioning, arguing).\n\n--- Page 65 ---\n4.2. CORPORA 51\nIAT enables locutions in ordinary, everyday conversations to be translated into a dialogue\ngame.Budzyńska and Reed [2011] gave the following example, which translates into the IAT\nmodel shown in Figure 4.5.\n(4.1) (1.1) Bob says, The government will inevitably lower the tax rate.\n(1.2) Wilma says, Why?\n(1.3) Bob says, Because lower taxes stimulate the economy.\n/T_he government\nwill inevitably\nlower the tax rate.Bob says, /T_he government will\ninevitably lower the tax rate.\nTA1\nWilma says, Why?\nTA2 RA1 IF3\nIF4IF2IF1\nBob says, Because lower\ntaxes stimulate the economy.Lower taxes\nstimulate the\neconomy.\nFigure 4.5: Sample annotation for Inference Anchoring Theory based on Budzyńska and Reed\n[2011]. IF=illocutionary force; RA=inference between propositions; TA=dialogue rule that re-\nlate communication acts.\nLocutions may contain propositions, but properties of locution events (such as when or\nwhere they are spoken or by whom) may be important, so locution events themselves can also be\nused in arguments (e.g., about the speaker’s communicative ability or motivation or to establish\nthat someone really said something). Thus, Reed and Budzyńska [2011] describe pragmatics as\nthe connection between the locutions and the logical arguments put forward.\n4.2 CORPORA\nIn this section we list a number of annotated corpora that have been made available to the\ncommunity, grouped in web-based and other text material.

For a (hypothetical) example, in order to obtain the gist of a\nTwitter conversation, it can be suﬃcient to extract claims and purported evidence material. By\ncontrast, in order to run a deep analysis of argumentation strategies in left-wing vs. right-wing\nnewspapers, the editorials ideally need to be mapped to a complete constellation of statements,\ntheir argumentative relationships, and the reasoning patterns underlying those relationships.\nTherefore, similar to the surveys of Peldszus and Stede [2013] and Lippi and Torroni\n[2016a], we break the overall problem into a set of individual subtasks. In this chapter, we ad-\ndress the core task of ﬁnding the claim statements made by the writer, i.e., the central compo-\nnent of an argument. The next chapters will be concerned with ﬁnding additional components\n(viz., supporting and objecting statements), organizing them in a structured representation, and\nassessing some ‘deeper’ aspects of the argumentation.\nDepending on the application scenario, before ﬁnding argument components it can be\nnecessary to ﬁrst ﬁlter a set of input texts as to whether they might contain an argument at\nall or not. Thus, in Section 5.1, we consider the task of classifying a text as argumentative or\nnon-argumentative. This step applies both to full documents and to portions of text: many texts\ncontain both argumentative and other material, which then can be separated.\nAnother potential preparatory step concerns the delimitation of potential minimal units\nof argument analysis, i.e., those units that may become argument components. In practice, this is\nnot often operationalized as a separate task, but nonetheless we brieﬂy address it in Section 5.2.\nThen, in Section 5.3, we turn to the central task of identifying claimsin a text: what does\nthe writer argue for? Many implemented approaches combine this step with also ﬁnding the\nother core component of an argument—the supportive statements—but since for some pur-\nposes, just ﬁnding claims can be the most relevant problem, we discuss the two steps separately.\nThroughout this and the following chapters, we mention both work involving human\nannotation (albeit to a smaller extent), and automatic processing, including relevant datasets,\nmethods that have been applied, and the performance results that were achieved. Along the\nway we will see that there are several parallels to well-known NLP problems, such as opinion\nmining, semantic relation extraction, stance classiﬁcation, and discourse parsing. Accordingly,\nmany computational techniques can be borrowed from those areas.\n\n--- Page 71 ---\n58 5. FINDING CLAIMS\n5.1 CLASSIFYING TEXT AS ARGUMENTATIVE VS.\nNON-ARGUMENTATIVE\nThequestion“Argumentativeornot?”canbeaskedforacompletetextdocumentorforparticular\nparts of a text. As a special case of the latter, portions of dialogic interaction can be deemed\nargumentatively-relevant. We discuss these three situations in turn.\n5.1.1 DOCUMENT LEVEL\nWhen dealing with ‘traditional’ kinds of documents, the task can be couched as one of genre\nclassiﬁcation. In linguistics, a genre is conceived as a class of texts that\n• serve the same purpose,\n• often have a typical structure in terms of ‘zones’ playing speciﬁc roles for the common\npurpose (cf. Section 2.6.2), and\n• can have characteristic distributions of linguistic features.\nExamples of fairly ‘prototypical’ genres are recipes, weather reports, and persuasive essays. In\neach case, we expect certain pieces of information, linearized in a suitable or conventionalized\nway.\nNewspaper (and other print) text In NLP, automatic genre classiﬁcation has been applied,\nfor instance, to newspapers, where opinionated text (editorials, letters to the editor) is to be\ndistinguishedfromnon-opinionatednews.Eventhoughnoteveryopinionatedtextisnecessarily\nargumentative, the ability to distinguish categories like these is of relevance to argumentation\nmining, too.\nThe early work of Karlgren and Cutting [1994] and Kessler et al. [1997] on the Brown\nCorpus aimed at distinguishing various categories from each other, with one setting being ‘edi-\ntorial’ vs. ‘reportage’. These researchers experimented with part-of-speech (PoS) tags, document\nand sentence length, type/token ratio, punctuation symbols, and frequencies of speciﬁc words\nthat the authors considered relevant: ‘therefore’, ‘I’, ‘me’, ‘it’, ‘that’, and ‘which’. Kessler et al.\nreported classiﬁcation accuracies of 83% and 61% for reports and editorials, respectively.\nLater work replaced linguistic analysis by bag-of-words [Freund et al. ,2006] or bag-of-\ncharacter-n-grams [Sharoﬀ et al., 2010] models. Such knowledge-free approaches yielded very\ngood results in the domains of the training data, but, as shown by Petrenz and Webber [2011],\nthis idea is extremely vulnerable to shifts in topics and domains. Working with the New York\nTimesAnnotatedCorpus(NYTAC),1PetrenzandWebberreimplementedearlierapproaches,built\nsubsetsofarticlescoveringdiﬀerenttopics,anddemonstratedthattheearlyworkusinglinguistic\nfeatures is more robust when the topics of the articles change.\n1https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc2008t19 (accessed May 28, 2018)\n\n--- Page 72 ---\n5.1. CLASSIFYING TEXT AS ARGUMENTATIVE VS. NON-ARGUMENTATIVE 59\nIn the same spirit, Krüger et al. [2017] used texts with diﬀerent topics, and they also var-\nied the newspaper and the time of origin of the texts, by working with the Brown, NYTAC, and\nWall Street Journal corpora. For distinguishing editorials and letters to the editor from news\ntexts, they experimented with a large linguistic feature set and showed that it generally outper-\nforms PoS and bag-of-lemma approaches. Among the most predictive features were ﬁrst- and\nsecond-personpronouns,negationsuﬃxes,andcertainwordclassessuchassentimentwordsand\ncommunication verbs. The results diﬀer quite a bit among the various settings they considered.\nWe mention here just one: When classifying ‘opinion’ vs. ‘news’, trained on the mixed-topic\nWSJ corpus and tested on NYTAC ‘medicine’ articles, the F-score for the best model was 0.87.\nWeb text To assist a user who is interested in diﬀerent viewpoints on a controversial topic,\nRoitman et al. [2016] devised a document retrieval method for Wikipedia articles. First, this\nsystem ﬁnds articles that address the desired topic, by means of current information retrieval\ntechniques. In a follow-up step, the document set is reranked according to its argumentative\npotential. To this end, the authors employ a manually-built list of words that can point to con-\ntroversy, including ‘justify’, ‘deny’, and others.\nAlthough Wikipedia text is relatively orderly, the majority of web text to be exploited\nfor argumentation mining is generated by users and thus can pose well-known challenges for\nautomatic processing. Habernal and Gurevych [2017] compiled a corpus of such texts, designed\nto cover a set of predeﬁned topics within the domain of education. Their work includes an\nannotation study where contributions to online forums and user comments had to be judged\nas either persuasive or non-persuasive.2For a document to be considered persuasive, it also has\nto be on-topic, so that in eﬀect a second classiﬁcation dimension is mixed into the task. Three\nannotators labeled 990 documents and achieved a Fleiss \u0014of 0.59. This step lead to a gold-\nstandard set of 524 persuasive on-topic documents. As a common source of disagreement, the\nauthors note the presence of implicit claims or stances, thus involving interpretation on the side\nof the annotators. Habernal and Gurevych then built an automatic SVM classiﬁer using lexical\nn-gram baseline features and obtained a macro-F score of 0.69. In a follow-up experiment, they\nused a rich feature set, but the results turned out to be worse than the baseline.\n5.1.2 SUB-DOCUMENT LEVEL\nIn principle, the attribute of being ‘argumentative’ can also be applied to paragraphs or other\nstretches of text, but to our knowledge this has not been explicitly addressed in the research yet.\nInstead, the task is commonly tackled on the level of sentences or clauses.\n2While in general not every argument aims at persuasion, within the genre considered here, ‘argumentative’ and ‘persuasive’\ncan be considered as referring to the same class of texts.\n\n--- Page 73 ---\n60 5. FINDING CLAIMS\nSentences Themajorityofresearchonﬁne-grainedargumentativityclassiﬁcationisconcerned\nwith ﬁnding sentences in monologue text, but the task has been framed in a variety of slightly\ndiﬀerent ways.\nWe begin with some pioneering work in argumentation mining by Moens et al. [2007].\nThey worked with texts from AraucariaDB [Reed et al., 2008a] and with court decisions from\nthe European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), and as their ﬁrst analysis step classiﬁed sen-\ntences as argumentative or not. (Some examples of argumentative sentences from the ECHR\ncorpus are shown later in Figure 5.1on page 65.) As features they used lexical (token n-grams,\nadverbs, verbs, modals, argumentative markers) and syntactic (punctuation, depth of parse tree,\nnumber of subclauses) features as well as some text statistics, such as length of sentence and\nposition of sentence in the text. With multinomial naive Bayes and maximum entropy models,\nthey achieved accuracies of 73% and 80%, respectively, for the two data sets.\nFlorou et al. [2013] worked with Greek texts concerning public policy-making, to identify\nsentences expressing a position toward a proposal. The authors speciﬁcally proposed that “future\nand conditional tenses and moods often indicate conjectures and hypotheses which are com-\nmonly used in argumentation techniques such as illustration, justiﬁcation, rebuttal”, and they\nstudied these features in tandem with a manually compiled list of connectives signaling justiﬁ-\ncation, explanation, deduction, rebuttal, and conditionals. With a C4.5 decision tree classiﬁer,\ntheir best result is an F-score of 0.76 for a subset of the morphosyntactic and lexical features.\nAmong the ﬁrst researchers applying the task to social media, Goudas et al. [2014] clas-\nsiﬁed Greek sentences from blogs and other web sites as “containing an argument or not”. They\nused a rich feature set including certain PoS distributions, position, and length features, manu-\nally selected cue words, the number of entities mentioned in previous sentences, as well as token\nn-grams. With a logistic regression classiﬁer, they obtained an accuracy of 77%. Turning to\nTwitter, Dusmanu et al. [2017] used a feature set including n-grams, Twitter-speciﬁc tokens\nlike emoticons, dependency triples, and sentiment information for classifying tweets as argu-\nmentative or not, and they report an F1-score of 0.78, obtained by a linear regression classiﬁer.3\nAl-Khatib et al. [2016a] suggest a distant supervision approach to classifying argumenta-\ntive units: they automatically labeled text from idebate.org as argumentative or not, depending\non which of the pre-deﬁned components in the forum the text belongs to.4On this data, they\ntrain a classiﬁer that uses n-grams, constituency syntax production rules, as well as various mor-\nphosyntactic features. They evaluated the model on the same type of data (obtaining an accu-\nracy of 0.92), as well as on two other corpora: the persuasive essay corpus of Stab and Gurevych\n[2014a] and the web text corpus of Habernal and Gurevych [2017] (both mentioned in our list\nin Section 4.2.2). On those corpora, the accuracy is 0.67 and 0.88, respectively. The authors then\nalso report results on cross-domain train/test experiments.\n3The DART data set [ Bosc et al., 2016a] contains 4,000 Twitter posts that annotators identiﬁed as non-/argumentative (de-\nﬁned as “(not) containing an opinion”). In addition, around 1,900 argumentative tweets were grouped by semantic similarity\n(topics) and then, within groups, pairwise linked via the relations support (446 tweets), attack (122), and unknown (1,323).\n4The resulting corpus is available for research: https://www.webis.de/data (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 74 ---\n5.1. CLASSIFYING TEXT AS ARGUMENTATIVE VS. NON-ARGUMENTATIVE 61\nStudent essays are another very popular genre for argumentation mining, where the ulti-\nmate goal is to evaluate the quality of the essay and hence of the argumentation therein. Follow-\ning this direction, Song et al. [2014] posed the non-/argumentative distinction in a more speciﬁc\nway: they aimed to classify whether a sentence addresses a critical question of an argumentation\nscheme (in the sense of Walton, see Section 3.3) and can thus be considered argumentatively\nrelevant. Features were n-grams of the sentence and the two surrounding ones, sentence po-\nsition and length, PoS tag presence, and lexical overlap between the sentence and the writing\nprompt underlying the essay. The performance of their logistic regression model was measured\nby Cohen \u0014and was in the range of up to 0.5 in various train/test settings involving the same\nor diﬀerent prompts.\nWhile the approaches discussed thus far performed binary classiﬁcation (argumentative\nor not), it is also possible to solve the problem as a byproduct of running a multi-class classiﬁer\nthat detects the speciﬁc argumentative role of a sentence, and also allows for a ‘none’ value. An\nexample for this technique is the system by Stab and Gurevych [2014b], which is also trained\nand tested on student essays. Using a very rich set of features (structural, lexical, syntactic, and\nspeciﬁc lexical cues) they experimented with several classiﬁcation techniques, leading to a best\nresult of 77.3% accuracy (macro-F 0.73) obtained by an SVM. The F-score for the class ‘none’\nwas 0.88. It turned out that the text-statistics and structural features are most helpful, which\npoints to the role of conventionalized writing patterns in the genre of student essays. More\ndetails on this classiﬁer will be provided below on page 70.\nSub-sentences Presupposing that sentences are the proper unit for making the non-\n/argumentative distinction is for many use cases a simpliﬁcation. As, for example, Palau and\nMoens [2009] or Lawrence et al. [2014] pointed out, a complex sentence may very well contain\nmore than one argument component (i.e., a premise and a conclusion), and furthermore it may\ncontain both argumentative and non-argumentative material, which ought to be kept separate\nwhen a ﬁne-grained analysis is being targeted. For automatic analysis this is a complication,\nthough, and hence it is not uncommon (see, e.g., Song et al. [2014]) to let human annotators\nmark arbitrary text spans as argumentative, but then for the automatic approach to reduce the\nﬁne-grained annotation to sentence-level.\nLawrence et al. [2014] argue that the initial step of non/-argument classiﬁcation should\nbe to separate the text into a sequence of individual ‘propositions’, by which the authors mean a\nsequenceofwordsthatisnotnecessarilydelimitedbypunctuationoronsyntacticgrounds.5They\ntokenize the text, compute a feature set for each token, and train two classiﬁers for identifying\ntokens starting and ending a proposition, respectively. Features are the word, its PoS tag and\nlength, and the two words preceding and following the word in question. The results were not\nvery encouraging, though: on a cleaned version of a book chapter, this approach leads to an\naccuracy of 20% of correctly identiﬁed propositions (with exact matching), and the ﬁgure even\n5Hence, like in the other work reported here, the authors are notaiming at any semantic analysis when speaking of ‘proposi-\ntions’.\n\n--- Page 75 ---\n62 5. FINDING CLAIMS\ndecreases (surprisingly) as further chapters are added as training data. Lawrence et al. do not\nmake the decision on the argumentativeness of propositions directly; rather it occurs as a side\neﬀect of classifying argument components (to be discussed in the next chapters). Any ‘leftover’\nmaterial from that step is considered non-argumentative.\n5.1.3 SUMMARY\nThe performance ﬁgures quoted above are generally not bad, but when considering the fea-\ntures that are being used for classiﬁcation, we largely ﬁnd ‘the usual suspects’, including bag-of-\nwords, PoS tag distributions, and positional and length information. This indicates that most\napproaches are geared toward separating a domain-speciﬁc document set in two parts, rather\nthan to speciﬁcally capturing the linguistic signals of argumentativeness. Among the exceptions\nis the idea of manually compiling lists of words indicating controversy [Roitman et al., 2016],\nand of employing larger sets of linguistically motivated features. The latter approach, however,\nled to mixed results: it served the purpose of separating editorials from news in Krüger et al.\n[2017] but did not perform well on web text in Habernal and Gurevych [2017]. At any rate, the\nstandard features appear to capture more general aspects of subjectivity and opinion, while not\nnecessarily those of argumentation in particular. Hence, it is not clear yet whether a relatively\ndomain-independent separation of argumentative and non-argumentative text spans can in fact\nbe achieved using standard surface-based features.\n5.2 SEGMENTING TEXT INTO ARGUMENTATIVE UNITS\nThe task of segmentation amounts to partitioning an argumentative text (or portion of text) into\nunits that can later on be identiﬁed as playing a certain role—or none—in the argumentation.\nThis is diﬃcult, though, and from the perspective of NLP practitioners, it is tempting to eﬀec-\ntively circumvent this segmentation step by using sentences as the ‘default’ unit. This strategy\nhas two obvious consequences.\n• Argumentative units that are smaller than sentences cannot be processed:\n(5.1) [Although the candidate has a few good ideas,] [you should not vote for her!]\n• Argumentative units that consist of more than a single sentence are diﬃcult to process:\n(5.2) We need to tear the building down. 1[It is contaminated with asbestos. 2[In\nevery single corner. 3[From the ﬁrst to the last ﬂoor! 4\nThe ﬁrst problem is illustrated above in Example 5.1. The second problem can be par-\nticularly acute when working with user-generated texts, where the ‘sentence’ can be hard to\ndeﬁne, and material between punctuation marks can be very short. In Example 5.2(taken from\nPeldszus and Stede [2013]), statement 1 is the claim made by the speaker, and the evidence\nis provided by the sequence 2–4; there is no point in assigning an argumentative role to each\n\n--- Page 76 ---\n5.2. SEGMENTING TEXT INTO ARGUMENTATIVE UNITS 63\nsentence individually. Hence, a sentence-oriented system needs a way to distinguish between a\nsequence of sentences that each provide diﬀerent evidence (and which play the same role for the\nargument), and a sequence of sentences that collectively form a single argumentative unit, as in\nExample 5.2.\nSo, in principle, the minimal units of argumentation may span multiple full sentences, or\nbe shorter than a sentence, and thus we can characterize an argumentative discourse unit (ADU)\nas\na span of text that plays a single role for the argument being analyzed, and is demar-\ncated by neighboring text spans that play a diﬀerent role, or none at all.\nHumanannotation Taking our deﬁnition seriously would mean to assign the question of de-\nmarcating units to human annotators, and then try to reproduce it by automatic means. A few\nresearchers took the ﬁrst step and produced datasets where annotators have been asked to de-\nlimit the ADUs, without setting any restrictions on pre-deﬁned unit candidates. For example,\nWacholder et al. [2014], in their annotation of ‘callout’ and ‘target’ in online interactions (see\nSection 4.2), evaluated cases where annotators disagreed only by few tokens, and devised a strat-\negy for deriving a gold standard from their annotations. Also, in the web text corpus of Habernal\nand Gurevych [2017] (see Section 5.3.5), boundaries were decided freely by annotators (yet in\ntheir automatic approach, the authors re-simpliﬁed the task to working with sentences only).\nComputation Among the few approaches that actually tackle the segmentation problem (in-\nstead of working with sentences as default units), some employ a syntax parser to supply clauses,\nwhich then serve as candidates for minimal units. For instance, the early work of Palau and\nMoens [2009] on legal text used syntactic clauses as units to be classiﬁed as argumentative or\nnot. More recently, Persing and Ng [2016] used manually-devised rules for ﬁltering parse trees\nand obtaining argumentative units for analyzing student essays. They worked with the corpus\ncompiled by Stab and Gurevych [2014a] (see Section 4.2.2), which has been annotated on the\nlevel of clauses. Persing and Ng extracted ADU candidates from a parse tree, and in their eval-\nuation, they accounted for boundary mismatches with two separate measures: one for exact\nmatching, and one for partial matching, where success is deﬁned as 50% of the tokens being\nin agreement. Their overall F-score for argument component identiﬁcation is 0.57 with partial\nmatch and 0.47 for exact match, where the diﬀerence indicates the diﬃculties with exact ADU\nboundary detection. However, on the same corpus, Eger et al. [2017] perform a comparative\nstudy of various approaches, where the best one (an LSTM-based dependency parser) achieves\nan F1-score of 0.91 for ﬁnding the exact boundaries of argument components. The authors also\nprovide an informative error analysis, and they point out that their result even beats the human\nagreement that was determined by Habernal and Gurevych [2017] as 0.89.\nA recent thorough study of the segmentation problem was done by Ajjour et al. [2017].\nThese authors experimented with diﬀerent feature sets as well as diﬀerent machine learning\nmodels, and were also interested in cross-domain performance. For this reason they worked with\n\n--- Page 77 ---\n64 5. FINDING CLAIMS\nthree diﬀerent available datasets (student essays, news editorials, and web discourse). In terms\nof features, it turned out that for in-domain analysis, bag-of-words features are most helpful\n(whereas embeddings did generally not help), while structural features (whether the token is at\nbeginning/middle/end of a sentence/clause/phrase) proved most robust when training on one\ndomainandtestingontheother.Regardingmachinelearningapproaches,abidirectionalLSTM\nachieved the best results in most cases, regardless of the domain or the features.\nAn important observation, however, was that the cross-domain scenario suﬀered from\ngenerally bad performance. The authors take this as an indication that the notion of ADU is\nnot quite the same across diﬀerent corpora, and hence across diﬀerent annotation guidelines.\nEvidence for this hypothesis is the high variance that Aijour et al. found in the size of ADUs,\nranging from clause-like segments in the newspaper data to the frequent occurrence of multiple\nsentences in a Wikipedia data set by Aharoni et al. [2014] (see Section 5.3.4).\n5.3 IDENTIFYING CLAIMS\nDetecting claims is the ﬁrst of two indispensable tasks for any argumentation mining system\n(the second one being the detection of evidence or premises), and accordingly, a lot of work has\nbeen undertaken here. However, the reader should also be reminded that in many instances of\nargumentation, there is no explicit claim being formulated at all; instead the reader needs to\nderive it from what is said. In fact, Habernal and Gurevych [2017] report that in their social\nmedia data, almost half of all claims are only implicit. The ensuing problem of actually inferring\nclaims is obviously very diﬃcult and has not received much attention. Instead, the research has\nfocused on the simpler task of only identifying explicit claims.\nWe can broadly distinguish two families of methods that have so far been applied to claim\ndetection.\nClassiﬁcation Given a minimal unit of analysis (in practice this is almost always a sentence,\nas described in the previous section), it can be classiﬁed in diﬀerent ways.\n• Binary classiﬁcation: claim or no claim.\n• Binary classiﬁcation: claim/premise. When the overall goal of the system is restricted to\nﬁnding claims and premises, thus adopting a coarse-grained deﬁnition of argument, then\nthe classiﬁer can directly distinguish between these two types of unit.\n• Multi-class classiﬁcation: When more types of argument components are being consid-\nered, they may be identiﬁed by a single classiﬁer. Also, as pointed out earlier, one class\ncan be ‘none’, so that the decision whether the unit is argumentative at all is also included\nhere.\n\n--- Page 78 ---\n5.3. IDENTIFYING CLAIMS 65\nSequence labeling Some approaches tackle the identiﬁcation of argument components\n(claims and possibly more) as an IOB labeling problem.6Thus, words are tagged as B-premise,\nB-claim, I-premise, I-claim, or O. Again, this can subsume the detection of non-argumentative\nmaterial. Also, when claim detection is the onlytask performed by a system, it is trivially iden-\ntical to the task of non-/argumentative classiﬁcation. We will discuss this type of work in the\npresent section (rather than above in 5.1), because the deﬁnitions used for ‘claim’ in this work\nare more speciﬁc than those generally adopted for ‘argumentative’.\nWe organize the following summary by the genres being addressed, as these imply certain\ndiﬀerences as to what exactly a ‘claim’ is.\n5.3.1 LEGAL DOCUMENTS\n{ [ SUPPORT:  /T_he Court recalls that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article x of the Convention art. x obliges \nthose seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial or arbitral organ to use ﬁrst the remedies provided by the \nnational legal system.\nCONCLUSION:  Consequently, States are dispensed from answering before an international body for their acts before they have had an \nopportunity to put matters right through their own legal systems. ]\n[ SUPPORT:  /T_he Court considers that, even if it were accepted that the applicant made no complaint to the public prosecutor of \nill-treatment in police custody, the injuries he had sustained must have been clearly visible during their meeting.\nAGAINST : However, the prosecutor chose to make no enquiry as to the nature, extent and cause of these injuries, despite the fact that in \nTurkish law he was under a duty to investigate see paragraph above.\nSUPPORT:  It must be recalled that this omission on the part of the prosecutor took place after Mr Aksoy had been detained in police \ncustody for at least fourteen days without access to legal or medical assistance or support.\nSUPPORT:  During this time he had sustained severe injuries requiring hospital treatment see paragraph above.\nCONCLUSION:  /T_hese circumstances alone would have given him cause to feel vulnerable, powerless and apprehensive of the \nrepresentatives of the State. ]\nCONCLUSION:  /T_he Court therefore concludes that there existed special circumstances which absolved the applicant from his obligation \nto exhaust domestic remedies. }\nFigure 5.1: Annotated text from an ECHR decision based on Palau and Moens [2009].\nA prominent example for argumentation in legal texts is a court justifying its ruling in the\ndecision document. In Figure 5.1, we reproduce an annotated example from Palau and Moens\n[2009],whoworkedondecisionsoftheEuropeanCourtofHumanRights(ECHR).Thebrack-\neting indicates the hierarchical structure (to some extent): the ﬁrst two paragraphs represent\nsub-arguments that both are given in support of the overall conclusion in the third paragraph.\nThus, ‘conclusion’ in their terminology corresponds to what we call a ‘claim’. For the central\nconclusions, the surface form “The court concludes that X” or some paraphrase can be regarded\nas typical; but notice that the interim conclusions can be descriptions of various kinds, in fairly\ngeneral form.\n6IOB stands for inside-outside-beginning. This method represents labeled “target” text spans by tagging the tokens of a text\nwith one of the three letters: B = token is the beginning of a span; I = token is within a span (‘inside’); O = token is not part\nof a span (‘out’). As an example, consider ﬁnding all named entities (NE) in a text. B indicates that NE begins, I indicates\nthat an NE continues: We-O met-O in-O the-O New-B York-I City-I subway-O .\n\n--- Page 79 ---\n66 5. FINDING CLAIMS\nBefore the task of ‘argumentation mining’ was identiﬁed and labeled as such, legal case\ndocuments were analyzed from an information extraction point of view, in an attempt to dis-\ntinguish the diﬀerent functions of sentences, very similar to the ‘argumentative zoning’ idea\nofTeufel and Moens [2002], which we mentioned in Section 2.6.2. For example, Hachey and\nGrover [2006] annotated ‘rhetorical roles’ in judgments of the UK House of Lords, the goal\nbeing that of automatic summarization. Seven roles were distinguished, among them ‘fact’ (re-\ncounting the events triggering the legal proceedings), ‘background’ (citation of source of law\nmaterial), and ‘framing’, which represents parts of the judge’s argumentation. Using features\nsimilar to those of Teufel and Moens (cue phrases, location, entities, sentence length, quota-\ntions, thematic words), the authors obtained a micro-averaged F-score of 0.6 with an SVM\nclassiﬁer using all features, but, interestingly, a decision tree classiﬁer using only location fea-\ntures achieved a considerably better score of 0.65.\nPalau and Moens [2009] went a step further and distinguished the argumentative roles\nshown in Figure 5.1. Their SVM model for premise/conclusion classiﬁcation takes as input sen-\ntences that have already been predicted to be argumentative (see our description in Section 5.1).\nThe resulting F-scores for premise and conclusion are 0.68 and 0.74, respectively. Among their\nfeatures are syntactic ones (subject type, main verb tense), domain-speciﬁc cues, token counts,\nposition of sentence, and a contextual feature with the prediction for the previous and the fol-\nlowing segment.\nMore recently, Rooney et al. [2012] proposed an SVM sequence kernel classiﬁer as an\nalternative to the type of feature engineering done by Palau and Moens. The kernel compares\nsubsequences of sentences, where a word is tagged with its root form and PoS label. These\nauthors worked with the Araucaria DB dataset [Reed et al., 2008a], which contains arguments\nnot only from legal documents but also from newspapers, advertising, and several other genres.\nThe task is to label sentences as containing a premise (1299 instances in the annotated corpus),\ncontaining a claim (304 instances), being part of both a premise and a claim (161), or none\n(1686). Using 10-fold cross-validation, Rooney et al. report an overall accuracy of 0.65, which\nthose authors consider as promising on the grounds of dispensing with sophisticated features.\nFor claims, the result is particularly low, though (around 0.3).\nIn general, mining legal texts is a very diﬃcult task. For an overview of the limitations of\ncurrent IR systems and a sketch of necessary steps for automated argument retrieval, see Ashley\nand Walker [2013a].\n5.3.2 INSTRUCTIONAL TEXT\nInstructions, as they can be found in user manuals, often include advice and warnings; some-\ntimes, these are backed up by an explanation designed to increase the reader’s motivation to\nactually obey them. Here are some examples from Saint-Dizier [2012].\n(5.3) Never put this cloth into the sun; otherwise it will shrink dramatically.\n\n--- Page 80 ---\n5.3. IDENTIFYING CLAIMS 67\n(5.4) It is essential that you switch oﬀ electricity before starting any operation. Electricity\nshocks are a major source of injuries and death.\nAs such, the structure and function correspond exactly to that of an argument, where the claim\nis of the speciﬁc type ‘instruction’ to do or not do something. Based on a corpus study covering\nFrench and English text, Saint-Dizier concluded that such constructions have a highly regular\nlinguistic form, making it relatively easy to identify them. In his approach, a set of manually-\nconstructed rules serves to identify both the ‘claim’ and the supporting statements. The rules\nexploit the linear order of the statements, and a set of common lexical patterns. These pat-\nterns may contain expressions on diﬀerent levels of abstraction such as word form, word set, or\npart of speech. The rule language is processed by a dedicated text processing platform devel-\noped by the author, called <TextCoop> . Saint-Dizier reports recognition accuracies of 88%/91%\n(claim/support) for warnings and 79%/84% for advice.\n5.3.3 STUDENT ESSAYS\nEssays written by students in response to a given prompt are a target of NLP primarily for\nthe application of automatically scoring them, or for supporting the human grader or peer-\nreviewer by automatically adding helpful markup (and thereby encouraging the grader to provide\nqualitative feedback). A signiﬁcant portion of essays in education are persuasive, which Burstein\nand Marcu [2003, p. 457] deﬁne as requiring “the writer to state an opinion on a particular topic,\nand to support the stated opinion to convince the reader that the perspective is valid and well-\nsupported.”\nWe can broadly distinguish two lines of work here, which use slightly diﬀerent labeling\nschemes.\nThesisandconclusion Especially the American tradition of essay writing encourages students\nto make sure that their texts contain a ‘thesis’ and a ‘conclusion’. According to Falakmasir et al.\n[2014, p. 254], a thesis “communicates the author’s position and opinion about the essay prompt;\nit anchors the framework of the essay, serving as a hook for tying the reasons and evidence\npresented and anticipates critiques and counterarguments”, whereas the conclusion “reiterates\nthe main idea and summarizes the entire argument in an essay. It may contain new information,\nsuch as self-reﬂections on the writer’s position.”\nFinding these two elements is made diﬃcult by two features of student essays: as opposed\nto other genres like the legal texts discussed above, or scientiﬁc articles, student essays have little\ninternal structure in terms of headings and subheadings. Furthermore, topics vary widely, and\nthe students’ theses are often substantiated by personal experience rather than by cited sources\nor authorities. Thus, the role of genre-speciﬁc wording can also be expected to be less helpful\nthan for other texts. However, we will see that positional features can play an important role for\nthe task.\n\n--- Page 81 ---\n68 5. FINDING CLAIMS\n“You can’t always do what you want to do!,” my mother said.

Their annotation rules state that both components can\nbe one or more sentences, but no sub-sentences. For their decision-tree classiﬁer, the authors\nused various positional features of sentences and paragraphs, syntactic clause types, and a set\nof manually-deﬁned cue words. One group contained connectives (e.g., ﬁrst, in summary, in\nconclusion, etc.),theotherincludedmodalsandotherlexicalelementssuchas agree.Furthermore,\nthe output of an early, cue-based discourse parser [Marcu, 2000] was mapped to two sentence\nfeatures: the nuclearity status and the coherence relation the sentence takes part in (according\nto Rhetorical Structure Theory [ Mann and Thompson, 1988]). Feature utility tests were not\nreported. A crucial question for an approach as lexically-based as this one is how to transfer to\na new content domain, i.e., a new essay prompt. When evaluating on a prompt that was not\npresent in the training set, the approach reached an average F-score of 0.54 for thesis and 0.8\nfor conclusion segments.\nFalakmasiretal.

IDENTIFYING CLAIMS 69\ncentral goal of this work was feature engineering, and the authors used an iterative process to\nﬁndthemostpredictivefeatures:startingwith42 basicfeatures(position,syntax,cues,rhetorical\nstatus) inspired by the Burstein/Marcu work, they employed several feature selection algorithms\nand experimented with various combinations. Finally, they converged on the following.\n•Positional features:sentencenumberintheparagraph,paragraphnumberintext,andtype\nof paragraph (ﬁrst, body, and last paragraph). A positional baseline predicts all sentences\nin the ﬁrst paragraph as a thesis and all sentences within the last paragraph as a conclusion.\n• Various features based on the syntactic/semanticanalysisanddependencyparsing of the\nsentence. Prepositional and gerund phrases turned out as highly predictive of thesis and\nconclusion sentences, as did the number of adjectives and adverbs within the sentence.\n• A set of frequent words (e.g.,although, even though, because, due to, led to, caused ).\n•Essay-level features: number of keywords among the most frequent words of the essay,\nnumber of words overlapping with the assignment prompt, and a sentence importance\nscore based on RST (similar to the feature used by Burstein and Marcu [2003], mentioned\nabove).\nA three-way classiﬁcation experiment (thesis, conclusion, other) was performed, where the-\nsis/conclusion sentences whose quality had been rated 1 were shifted to the ‘other’ category.\nAmong three tested methods a decision tree classiﬁer produced the best F-measures (0.83 for\nthesis and 0.59 for conclusion on the test set).\nIn a follow-up study on the same dataset, Jabbari et al. [2016] focused on ﬁnding thesis\nstatements,andnotedthatthecentralchallengeinthepreviousworkwastheskeweddistribution\nof non-/thesis sentences, which had been tackled by means of complex feature optimization. As\nanalternative,theynowproposedtoinsteadbalancethetrainingdatadistribution.Withrandom\nunder- and oversampling as baselines, their experiment centered on the SMOTE approach for\ngenerating additional ‘synthetic’ examples [Chawla et al. ,2002]. The idea of that technique\nis to produce new instances not on the text but on the feature vector level, by interpolating\nbetween existing minority instance vectors. The classiﬁcation problem was somewhat simpliﬁed\nby considering only sentences in the ﬁrst paragraph of the text (where theses commonly show\nup). Using an SVM, for ﬁnding theses the authors achieved a micro-F-score of 0.9, which\ncompares favorably to the earlier work as well as to the two baselines (0.84 with undersampling;\n0.87 with oversampling).\nMajor claim, claim, and premise A second line of research was started with the Persuasive\nEssay Corpus [ Stab and Gurevych ,2014a], which we introduced in Section 4.2.2. According to\nthe annotation scheme, an essay can have one major claim, which expresses the author’s stance\nwith respect to the topic, and which is usually found in the ﬁrst paragraph. (It appears to corre-\nspondtothe thesisstatementintheschemeexplainedabove.)Twoexamples[StabandGurevych ,\n2014a, p. 1503] are as follows.\n\n--- Page 83 ---\n70 5. FINDING CLAIMS\n(5.5) I believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during education.\n(5.6) From my viewpoint, people should perceive the value of museums in enhancing their\nown knowledge.\nThen, the paragraphs between the introduction and the conclusion usually contain arguments\nrelated to the major claim. These consist of claimsandpremises , which (in contrast to the work\ndiscussed above) are annotated not as complete sentences but as continuous token sequences, cf.\nthe bold-faced portion of the examples above. Altogether, the corpus has 90 major claims (one\nper text) and 429 claims.\nThe detection of argument components is implemented as a four-way classiﬁer (major\nclaim, claim, premise, non-argumentative) presented by Stab and Gurevych [2014b], which\nwas mentioned in Section 5.1.2. Features can be grouped as follows.\n•Structural: location/length/punctuation.\n•Lexical: n-grams, verbs, adverbs, modals.\n•Syntactic: parse tree depth, production rules, verb tense.\n•Cues: connectives from the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) corpus [Prasad et al. ,\n2008], ﬁrst-person references.\n•Attributes of preceding and following sentence: number of tokens and of punctuation,\nnumber of sub-clauses, presence of modal verbs.\nAmong various classiﬁers, an SVM performed best. The F-scores are: major claim 0.63, claim\n0.54, premise 0.83, non-argumentative 0.88. While premises can be identiﬁed quite reliably also\nwhen using just a single group of features (F between 0.65 for syntactic and 0.78 for structural\nfeatures), the corresponding values for claims and major claims are much lower, the maximum\nbeing 0.48 (major claim) and 0.42 (claim) for structural features. In other words, claim detection\nproﬁts more from feature combination than premise detection does.\nIn later work on the same corpus, Nguyen and Litman [2015] describe an alternative\napproach that centers on lexical/cue features. Their idea is to separate the argumentative vocab-\nulary from that indicating the domain. To do this, they use LDA topic modeling [ Blei et al. ,\n2003] for learning domain and argumentation vocabulary from a separate corpus of 6794 es-\nsays (i.e., excluding those from the Stab/Gurevych evaluation corpus), starting with sets of seed\nwords. For argumentation, the set consists of 10 words. In Figure 5.3, we reproduce three of\nthe top-ranked argumentation (Topic 1) and domain (Topic 2, 3) word stems produced by their\nalgorithm. Altogether, 263 argument words are generated.\nFor the new classiﬁcation model, Nguyen and Litman reimplemented the features of\nStab/Gurevych, excluding the n-grams and the production rules. Instead, they added the newly\nharvested argument word unigrams, dependency pairs (as a replacement for skipped bigrams),\n\n--- Page 84 ---\n5.3.

The authors show that the new model\noutperforms the reimplementation (and the results that had been reported by Stab/Gurevych),\nespecially when only top-performing features are used.\n5.3.4 WIKIPEDIA\nA diﬀerent perspective on claim detection is taken by Aharoni et al. [2014] and Levy et al.\n[2014]. These researchers work on the IBM Debater project (cf. Sct. 1.3), whose overall goal is a\nsystem that searches web pages for pro and con arguments on a given controversial topic. Thus,\nthe claim detection task is dependent on a predeﬁned topic, which Levy et al. (p. 1489) deﬁne as\n“a short phrase that frames the discussion”; and a context-dependent claim is “a general, concise\nstatement that directly supports or contests the given topic.” The text source is Wikipedia pages,\nwhere (in contrast to other web text) a certain quality of language and argumentation can be\npresumed.\nA dataset was constructed on the basis of 32 debate motions from Debatabase .7Then, 326\nWikipedia articles were identiﬁed as relevant to these topics, and therein, annotators labeled\n976 topic-related claims, achieving a rather moderate agreement of \u0014=0.39. Figure 5.4shows\nexamples for annotation decisions. (Notice that, in other terminology, this ‘topic’ would itself\nqualify as a ‘claim’, as it represents a thesis or demand by the author.) A ‘V’ indicates that a\nsentence was regarded as a topic-dependent claim, while ‘X‘-marked sentences were not.\nIn general, claims need not be complete sentences but can be smaller units. The automatic\nclaim detection system thus needs to ﬁnd, given a Wikipedia page and a topic, sentences and\nsub-sentences that qualify as a relevant claim. To achieve this, Levy et al. built a pipeline of three\nmodules.\n7http://www.idebate.org/Debatabase (accessed May 28, 2018). Upon request, the authors are making this dataset avail-\nable for research.\n\n--- Page 85 ---\n72 5. FINDING CLAIMS\nFigure 5.4: Topic and associated claim candidates from Levy et al. [2014, p. 1490], used with\npermission.\nThe ﬁrst module is in charge of identifying sentences that contain a claim. A logistic\nregression classiﬁer uses features exploiting topic relevance (cosine similarity between the topic\nphrase and subjects in the sentence; and between the topic and a WordNet-expanded version\nof the sentence) and various topic-independent features (including morphosyntax, subjectivity,\nsentiment). It passes the top scoring 200 sentences to the next component.8\nForeachsentencefound,thesecondmodulegeneratesthe10bestcandidatesub-sentences\nusing a maximum likelihood model that primarily considers the tokens at the beginning and the\nend of the sequence. Then a logistic regression classiﬁer selects the most probable claim, again\nlooking at boundary tokens, along with a few other features.\nThe third module ranks the identiﬁed claims found for all the sentences, using another\nlogistic regression classiﬁer. It considers the scores produced by the previous components and\nalso re-computes some of the features that have been used in the preceding modules.\nIn subsequent work, Shnarch et al. [2017] added a pattern matching approach called\nGRASP, which integrates information from diﬀerent layers of analysis to the previous system.\nGRASP identiﬁes the most discriminative features for the classiﬁcation task, and composes\npatterns out of these. The authors note that these patterns are open to human inspection, hence\nallowing for qualitative error analyses. After adding this approach, signiﬁcant improvements in\nperformance on claim identiﬁcation are reported.\nWorking on a slightly bigger version of the IBM dataset, Lippi and Torroni [2015] ad-\ndressed only the ﬁrst step, i.e., sentence classiﬁcation, and suggested a rather diﬀerent approach.\nThey started from the observation that argumentative sentences are often characterized by com-\nmon ‘rhetorical structures’ and operationalized that intuition as the similarity between syntactic\n(constituency) parse trees. Their goal thus is to account for argumentative language irrespective\nof the domain, and to do so on the basis of syntactic patterns. They obtained the parses from\n8In this dataset, the input to step 1 consists of 1,500 Wikipedia sentences on average.\n\n--- Page 86 ---\n5.3. IDENTIFYING CLAIMS 73\nthe Stanford CoreNLP suite, and trained an SVM classiﬁer that exploits a partial tree kernel\nto compute similarities. The authors conclude that they can obtain results that are competitive\nto those of Levy et al. [2014], even without considering topic similarity. When adding a single\ncontextfeature(cosine similaritybetweenthe candidatesentence andthetopic, bothrepresented\nas bag of words), the F-measure increases by a further 1.2 points.\nIn addition, Lippi and Torroni tested their tree-similarity approach on the essay dataset\nbyStab and Gurevych [2014a] (mentioned in the previous subsection). Considering the union\nof their categories ‘claim’ and ‘major claim’ as the target class, Lippi and Torroni obtained an\nF-score of 0.71, which compares favorably to the results of Stab and Gurevych (whose problem\nwas a more diﬃcult multi-class task, though).\nFinally, we mention that the IBM dataset was used by Laha and Raykar [2016] for exper-\niments with RNNs and CNNs for detecting both claims and evidence (see next section). Their\ngoal was to establish the ﬁrst deep learning baselines for these tasks, and they report compar-\nisons of various architecture variants. For ﬁnding claims, however, the results were not as good\nas those obtained by Levy et al. [2014].\n5.3.5 SOCIAL MEDIA AND USER-GENERATED WEB TEXT\nFor many practical applications, the various kinds of social media (or other user-generated text)\nare a highly relevant source of opinions and arguments to be mined. Some early work addressed\npublic comments on proposed government regulations. Speciﬁcally, Kwon et al. [2007] studied a\ncorpus of user comments on proposed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency legislation. Here,\ntheclaim detectiontaskbeneﬁts fromall documentsaddressingthe same domain(the legislation\nin question). The authors exploited this by computing a feature representing the lexical overlap\nbetween sentences and the text topic ‘public policy’, in addition to various standard features\n(n-grams, frequencies of positive and negative words, position in text, and head verb token\nsequence). In the experiments, a boosting algorithm beat an SVM and achieved an agreement\nwith a human annotator of \u0014=0.55. In a follow-up step, the authors then computed the polarity\n(stance) of the claim by means of a seed word approach that identiﬁes positive and negative\nwords.\nIn later work, Rosenthal and McKeown [2012] sought to detect claims in LiveJournal\nweblogs and in Wikipedia discussion pages. They deﬁne claims as “assertions by a speaker who\nis attempting to convince others that his opinion is true” (p. 30), and more speciﬁcally attend\nto the class of claims expressing opinionated beliefs, which are deﬁned as “personal view[s] that\nothers can disagree with” (p. 30). Figure 5.5shows examples, which demonstrate that especially\nthe LiveJournal text can be very informal. Not surprisingly, it is not trivial to demarcate this class\nof claims precisely; when two annotators labeled 2,000 sentences as claims (without considering\nthe context) in each corpus, they achieved a Cohen \u0014of 0.50 for 663 LiveJournal sentences, and\n0.56 for 997 Wikipedia sentences.\n\n--- Page 87 ---\n74 5.

For the latter, the authors adoptedthe system by Prabhakaran et al. [2010], which\ntags individual words for the underlying type of belief: committed (I know), non-committed ( I\nmay), and not applicable ( I wish). Rosenthal and McKeown report various experiments on in-\ndomain and cross-domain classiﬁcation, including feature impact measurements. In brief, they\nfound that sentiment features are more useful in LiveJournal, while committed belief features\nare more predictive for Wikipedia discussions.\nOn a corpus of 204 diﬀerent social media and news documents (16,000 sentences) in\nGreek, Goudas et al. [2014] employed IOB sequence labeling for combined claim and premise\ndetection.Thefeatureswerethewordsinthesentence,domain-speciﬁcnamedentities,manually\ncompiled cue words, and verbs and adverbs found representative for claim and premise sentences\nby a TF-IDF computation. Their CRF model achieved a precision of 0.62 and recall of 0.32,\nresulting in an F-measure of 0.42. In follow-up work on news text, Sardianos et al. [2015]\nsought to reduce the role of domain-dependent gazetteer lists and report on experiments with\nword embeddings generated by word2vec [Mikolov et al., 2013].\nRecently, Habernal and Gurevych [2017] extended the IOB tagging approach to a set of\nargument components that they derived from the Toulmin scheme (see Section 3.4.1): backing,\nclaim, premise, rebuttal, refutation. They used the Web Discourse corpus (see Section 4.2.1),\nwhose annotation covers the aforementioned components, plus ‘appeal to emotion’ (representing\nthe pathos dimension of argumentation); see the example in Figure 5.6. We will come back to\nthis work in subsequent sections, and here just focus on the claim identiﬁcation. The trained\nhumanannotatorsachievedanagreementof0.59onclaims,measuredbyKrippendorf’sunitized\n\u000b.\nThe 11-class IOB tagging is applied to complete sentences as instances to be classiﬁed;\nthe authors argue that a token-level annotation is too ﬁne-grained for a machine learner. Conse-\nquently, the problem is simpliﬁed to deciding whether a sentence hosts an argument component\nor not. For sequence labeling, Habernal and Gurevych used SVMhmm. The rich feature set is\nsplit into ﬁve groups:\n\n--- Page 88 ---\n5.3. IDENTIFYING CLAIMS 75\nFigure 5.6: Sample annotation from the corpus of Habernal and Gurevych [2017, p. 169], used\nwith permission.\n•Lexical: word n-grams;\n•Structure and syntax: initial and ﬁnal tokens, relative positions, POS n-grams, depen-\ndency tree depth, constituency tree production rules, number of subclauses;\n•Topic and sentiment: LDA topics and ﬁve sentiment categories (-2, …, 2);\n•Semantics and discourse: semantic role labels, various coreference chain attributes, type\nof discourse relation, presence of connectives, attributions; and\n•Embeddings: sums of word embedding vectors.\nAll features are considered not only for the current sentence but also for the four preceding and\nfour subsequent sentences. The overall best results are achieved with the full feature set, yielding\na macro-F score of 0.25, in comparison to 0.6 obtained by human annotators. The classes Claim-\nB and Claim-I are among the top-performing classes, reaching 0.27 when omitting the lexical\nand structure/syntax features. As these numbers show, the problem tackled here is much harder\nthan those we discussed before.\n5.3.6 SUMMARY: FINDING CLAIMS OF DIFFERENT KINDS\nThe claim, undoubtedly, is at the heart of the argument—it states what the author wants us to\nbelieve.Beyondthisfairlygeneralcharacterization,however,diﬀerentauthorsprovidesomewhat\ndiﬀerent characterizations, and the corpus examples we have seen make it clear that there is a\n\n--- Page 89 ---\n76 5. FINDING CLAIMS\nrelatively broad range of statements treated as claims in diﬀerent text types and genres. Often,\nbut not always, claims are indicated by linguistic surface features, which some approaches try to\nisolate as topic-independent ‘claim shells’ that signal the claim. Also, in some genres, there seem\nto be relatively strong position-in-document tendencies that can be exploited, as for example in\nstudent essays.\nRecently, the variety in claim realizations prompted Daxenberger et al. [2017] to run a\nsystematic claim identiﬁcation experiment across six diﬀerent datasets.9They mapped the exist-\ning annotations to the sentence level, thus making a simplifying assumption, which, however, is\nshared by most of the previous work, as we have pointed out above. Daxenberger et al. wanted\nto measure the inﬂuence of diﬀerent groups of features (structure, lexical, syntax, discourse, em-\nbedding)10and learning approaches; they ran three deep learning schemes, and a regularized\nlogistic regression classiﬁer.\nFor in-domain classiﬁcation, they obtained an average macro-F score of 0.67, ranging\nfrom 0.6 (Wikipedia TalkPages) to 0.8 (arg. microtexts). Lexical (unigram), embedding, and\nsyntax features were most predictive, whereas structural features did not help in most cases.\nDiscourse features were useful only on the microtext corpus. The average performance of the\nbest neural network and the logistic regression classiﬁer was virtually the same.\nWith cross-domain training and testing, performance drops were found throughout, most\npronounced for the datasets that performed best in the in-domain setting. The best feature-\nbasedapproachoutperformedthedeeplearningapproachinmostscenarios.However,theneural\nnetworks beneﬁt when trained on all datasets but one and testing on the remaining one, yielding\nthe best results on average. Still, the best NN approach did not show beneﬁts over training on\ngood (single) source training datasets.\nAfter studying the six corpora further, Daxenberger et al. concluded that it is diﬃcult to\npredict cross-domain performance from lexical similarity of the datasets. Their overall conclu-\nsion is that “the essence of a claim is not much more than a few lexical clues.” This points to the\nimportant role of context: depending on genre and topic, a claim may on the surface look like\nany other declarative sentence, and only in the particular context assume the role of an opinion\nthat the speaker wants to convince the hearers of.\nFinally, we have to point out that the notion of claim will be given an additional facet of\ncomplication later in Chapter 7when we discuss structures of complex arguments: a statement\nin a text may be supported by another statement (which makes the ﬁrst one a claim) and at\nthe same time it may in turn support yet another statement and thus play multiple roles in the\nargumentation. But before turning to such recursive structures, we ﬁrst look more closely at the\n‘support’ relation.\n9Most of them have been introduced in Section 4.2.2or will be mentioned in the next chapter: AraucariaDB [Reed et al.,\n2008a], essays from Stab and Gurevych [2014b], web discourse from Habernal and Gurevych [2017], online comments and\nWikipedia talk pages from Biran and Rambow [2011], and argumentative microtexts from Peldszus and Stede [2016b].\n10They also experimented with sentiment dictionaries (as in, e.g., Rosenthal and McKeown [2012]) but found these to be of\nvery little value.\n\n--- Page 90 ---\n77\nC H A P T E R 6\nFinding Supporting and\nObjecting Statements\nDetecting claims, the topic of the previous chapter, is obviously a core task of argumentation\nmining, but in order to ﬁnd a complete argument, there is at least one more component to be\nidentiﬁed: the statement(s) that the author introduced to support the claim. In the argumenta-\ntion literature, this is often called the ‘premises’ of the argument; in other places it is ‘evidence’\nor ‘justiﬁcation’. In this chapter, we use these terms interchangeably with ‘support’.\nBesides claims and evidence, it may be important to also look for counter-arguments, in\ncase the text also mentions the ‘opposing view’, and the application seeks to identify it. Here is\na simple example.\n(6.1) You should buy that camera, because it has a brand-new excellent sensor. OK, it is quite\nexpensive. But it’s worth the money!\nOur speaker, in giving her recommendation, imagines an ‘opponent’ pointing out the high\npriceoftheproduct.Afterquotingthatpotentialcounterargument,sherefutesitbyemphasizing\nthe good value one gets for the money here. Thus, the argument components to be detected are\nas follows.\n•Claim: You should buy that camera.\n•Support: That camera has a brand-new excellent sensor.\n•Objection: That camera is quite expensive.\n•Support: That camera is worth the money.\nNotice that when ‘digging deeper’, we might want to not just enumerate the components but\nalso record in what way the speaker wants them to relate to each other (here especially the\nlink between the objection and the second support)—but that is the topic of the next chapter.\nFor now, in the following sections, we look at the tasks of ﬁnding support (Section 6.1) and\nobjections (Section 6.2). Furthermore, a potentially helpful related NLP task is stance detection,\nwhich determines whether a text communicates a positive or negative attitude toward a given\ntopic. We examine it brieﬂy in Section 6.3.\n\n--- Page 91 ---\n78 6. FINDING SUPPORTING AND OBJECTING STATEMENTS\n6.1 FINDING SUPPORTING STATEMENTS\nSupport or evidence, by deﬁnition, is evidence for something, and therefore stands in relation to\na claim. As long as there is only a single claim in our text, however, there is no need to explicitly\nestablish and represent this relation. Instead, it can just be left implicit. In these cases, sentence\nclassiﬁcation or sequence labeling, as described in the previous chapter for claim detection, is\nalso suﬃcient for identifying evidence.\nBut even when left implicit, the relatedness between claim and evidence can be exploited\nin argumentation mining. For a start, usually one item of evidence is textually adjacent to the\nclaim. Then, the relation may be marked linguistically by a connective such as because. But of\ncourse there can be multiple evidence statements spread across the text. Consider the following\nexample from the ‘argumentative microtext’ corpus [Peldszus and Stede, 2016b], which consists\nof only a claim (marked with a Csubscript) and a set of supporting statements, marked with S.\n(6.2)Should the death penalty be introduced in Germany?\nNo human being or human committee should again be given the permission to rule over\n‘life or death’. S[Courts are also subject to human error. S[That’s why Germany should\nnot introduce capital punishment! C[Every human, even those who have committed a\ndespicable crime, can bring themselves to regret and change their opinion. S[A door\nmust remain open for making amends. S\n(micro_b023)\nHere, the claim contains a phrasal connective ( that’s why ) linking it to the previous supporting\nstatement. The others, however, must be identiﬁed without recurring to such explicit markers.\nIn the rest of this section, we ﬁrst explain an approach that exploits relation marking in\nan interesting indirect way. Then we describe work on evidence detection in Wikipedia pages,\nwhich follows up on the corpus and claim detection of Aharoni et al. [2014] (see Section 5.3.4).\nFinally, we brieﬂy mention again some approaches that were already introduced in the previous\nchapter, as they tackle claim and evidence detection as a uniﬁed task.\n6.1.1 EXPLOITING DISCOURSE RELATION INDICATORS\nWhen the focus is not on classifying claim and evidence individually but on the relation be-\ntween the two, the problem is analogous to that of discourse relation identiﬁcation, as studied\nin frameworks like PDTB [ Prasad et al. ,2008] or RST [ Mann and Thompson, 1988]—recall\nour brief introduction in Section 2.6. The work of Biran and Rambow [2011] focused on ﬁnding\ninstances of the relation of argumentative support, and it targeted two types of web text: Live\nJournalblogthreads(henceforth:LJ)andWikipediatalkpages(WT).Concentratingonﬁnding\nsupporting statements, they assumed the claims as already marked in gold-standard annotated\ndata. For adding the support to the given claims, annotators achieved a \u0014of 0.69.\n\n--- Page 92 ---\n6.1. FINDING SUPPORTING STATEMENTS 79\nBiran and Rambow also oﬀer a classiﬁcation of diﬀerent types of support they found in\nthe data1:\n• Recommendation for action, and motivation for proposed action.\nClaim: “I’d post an update with the new date immediately.”\nJustiﬁcation: “In case anyone makes plans between now and when you post the reminder.”\n• Statement of like or dislike or of desires and longing, and subjective reason for this.\n• Statement of like or dislike or of desires and longing, and claimed objective reason for this.\n• Statement of subjectively perceived fact, with a proposed objective explanation.\n• A claimed general objective statement and a more speciﬁc objective statement that justiﬁes\nthe more general one.\nIn WT, on average there are 2.2 support statements per claim, compared to 1.5 in LJ. As\nfor the position in the threads, in LJ 97.3% are in the same entry as the claim, and 32.4% are\nin the sentence following the claim. In WT, the corresponding numbers are 87.7% and 22.9%.\nHence, looking only at individual entries when mining for support, in WT quite a few will not\nbe found.\nClaim-support relations in text may be explicitly signaled by connectives, or they may be\nonly implicit. For handling the explicit cases, Biran and Rambow compiled a list of connectives\nfrom the annotated RST Discourse Treebank [ Carlson et al. ,2003] (see Section 2.6) and se-\nlected 12 coherencerelationsthat they consideredas likely to correspondto a claim-support con-\nstellation; they are shown in Figure 6.1, together with example connectives (and other phrases)\nthat the authors retrieved from the corpus using a a variant of TF/IDF and a manual ﬁltering\nstep.\nThe resulting set of 69 explicit indicators was then used to indirectly get a handle also on\nimplicit relations. The intuition is that we may expect certain lexical regularities between claim\nand support: When I say something is expensive , I can typically support that with quoting a\nprice; when I suggest that the reader should attend a concert, I might indicate that the music will\nbelovely; and so forth. To establish a dictionary of such word pairs, Biran and Rambow looked\nfor instances of the 69 indicators in a large raw corpus, viz. the standard Wikipedia.2Given the\nbreadth of topics covered in Wikipedia, a potential domain-dependency of extracted word pairs\nis likely to be minimized. For each indicator, word pairs with a frequency >20 are extracted\nfrom sentences in which the indicator occurs.\nFinally, for the target task of ﬁnding claim/support sentences in the LJ and WT corpora,\nBiran/Rambow determined that just using the 69 indicator words does not beat a relatively\nsimplebaseline.Butwhenusingthewordpairslearnedinthepreviousstepasadditionalfeatures,\n1For reasons of space, we reproduce only one of the examples that the authors used to illustrate the classes (p. 364).\n2This is not to be confused with the small Wikipedia Talk pages (WT) corpus, which along with LJ is used for the ultimate\ntask of automatically ﬁnding support statements.\n\n--- Page 93 ---\n80 6. FINDING SUPPORTING AND OBJECTING STATEMENTS\nthe results of a Naive Bayes classiﬁer demonstrate that for both corpora, the large feature set\nclearly beats various baselines, reaching F-measures of 0.47 (LJ) and 0.5 (WT). When training\non one and testing on the other corpus, results are about 0.04–0.05 worse.\nBiran and Rambow [2011] concluded that plain single-sentence classiﬁcation for ﬁnding\nsupport is diﬃcult, but the presence of a claim and its location relative to the support candidate\nare important features that can signiﬁcantly boost performance.\nIn contrast to this decidedly data-driven approach, Eckle-Kohler et al. [2015] started\nfrom a pre-deﬁned list of connectives (and a few other particles) and determined their potential\nutility. Working with a relatively small German corpus (88 documents, mostly news text), the\naim was to determine which connectives correlate with claim, support (before or after the claim),\nand attack (before or after the claim). The before/after distinction is relevant because causal con-\nnectives signal directionality (e.g., ‘claim because support’ vs. ‘support, therefore claim’). German\nconnectives that in the data of Eckle-Kohler et al. frequently occur with claims are also(‘there-\nfore’),doch(‘however’), jedoch(‘though’), and sondern (‘but’); in premises they found denn(‘as’),\noder(‘or’), and und(‘and’). A classiﬁer using such groups of connectives can discriminate be-\ntween claims and premises with accuracies around 0.7, even though a unigram baseline is slightly\nbetter—but obviously using a much larger feature space.\nWhile the important role of connectives is well known, Villalba and Saint-Dizier [2012]\ndirected attention to some diﬀerent means of expressing coherence relations, and pointed out\nthat even non-argumentative coherence relations (i.e., others than those listed in Figure 6.1) can\nacquire an argumentative role when involving evaluative expressions, as they can be found for\nexample in product reviews. They illustrate this with the contrast between:\n(6.3) Red fruit tart (strawberries, raspberries)\n(6.4) Excellent location (3 mns from the Capitole, 5 mns from St Sernin Cathedral,...)\nIn6.3, the coherence relation is Elaboration: The parenthesis provides details on the red fruit.\nIn6.4, we ﬁnd the same surface pattern, also expressing Elaboration, but in addition there is a\nclaim-support constellation, as we are given a positive evaluation (of a hotel), and the elaborating\nmaterial provides good evidence for this.\nIn general, the relationship between discourse structure (as induced by coherence rela-\ntions) on the one hand and argumentation on the other is so far not entirely clear. In addition to\nthe work by Biran and Rambow [2011] and Villalba and Saint-Dizier [2012] mentioned above,\nthe issue is also discussed by Saint-Dizier [2012], Cabrio et al. [2013a], and Peldszus and Stede\n[2016a].\n6.1.2 CLASSIFYING SEGMENTS WITHOUT DISCOURSE CONTEXT\nThe alternative to considering the discourse context is to examine segments in isolation and\ndecide whether they represent evidence for a claim. One approach in this vein is that of Hasan\n\n--- Page 94 ---\n6.1. FINDING SUPPORTING STATEMENTS 81\nFigure 6.1: Coherence relations and extracted indicators from the RST-DT [Biran and Ram-\nbow,2011, p. 371], used with permission.\nand Ng [2014], who used data from the online debate platform createdebate.com. It covers two-\nsided debates, and each post is already labeled (by the user) with its pro/contra stance toward the\nissue. Hasan and Ng were interested in the reasons that debaters have provided for their stance.\nTaking posts from four diﬀerent domains, annotators marked sentences for containing a reason\nor not.3Afterward, the reasons were grouped and a number of classes identiﬁed; these labels\nwere also added to the data.4For illustration, Figure 6.2shows the pro/con reason classes that\nwere identiﬁed for the topic ‘abortion’.\nA MaxEnt classiﬁer was trained to decide which of the reasons from the predetermined\nset (if any) is present in a sentence. Hasan and Ng used uni- and bigrams, dependency relations,\nframe-semantic features from the SEMAFOR parser,5presence of quotations, and the position\nof the sentence in the post. The results for this diﬃcult multi-class problem varied between\n19.5% and 32.7% accuracy, depending on the domain. The main point of the work, however,\nwas to demonstrate that these ﬁgures can be improved by adding stance classiﬁcation , which we\nwill describe below in Section 6.3.\n3Hasan and Ng found that 3% of the sentences contained more than one reason; in these cases the annotation was reduced\nto the most prominent one. Notice that the multiplicity of reasons in a sentence is one aspect of the ADU demarcation\nproblem discussed in Section 5.2.\n4The corpus is available for research: http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~saidul/stance/ (accessed September 26, 2017).\n5http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/SEMAFOR/ (accessed September 26, 2017).\n\n--- Page 95 ---\n82 6. FINDING SUPPORTING AND OBJECTING STATEMENTS\nFigure 6.2: Reason classes annotated in debate posts on abortion [ Hasan and Ng ,2014, p. 753],\nused with permission.\nRinott et al. [2015] present an approach to identifying support statements in Wikipedia\ntext, following up on the work by Levy et al. [2014] on topic-dependent claim identiﬁcation\n(see Section 5.3.4). Now, the assumption is that a topic and a topic-relevant claim are already\ngiven, as well as a set of potentially relevant documents; and the goal is to ﬁnd evidence that can\nsupport the claim. The following example [ Rinott et al. ,2015, p. 441] lists three statements that\nwould ideally be classiﬁed as suitable evidence.\n•Topic: Use of performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) in professional sports.\n•Claim: PEDs can be harmful to athletes’ health.\n•Evidence statements:\n–(S1) A 2006 study examined 320 athletes for psychiatric side eﬀects induced by an-\nabolic steroid use. The study found a higher incidence of mood disorders in these\nathletes compared to a control group.

[Anecdotal]\nSimilar to Biran and Rambow [2011], the authors also provide a classiﬁcation of diﬀerent\ntypes of evidence; the categories are quite diﬀerent, however, due to the diﬀerent domains.\n•Study: Results of a quantitative analysis of data, given as numbers, or as conclusions. (e.g.,\nS1 above).\n•Expert: Testimony by a person/group/committee/organization with some known exper-\ntise/authority on the topic (e.g., S2 above).\n\n--- Page 96 ---\n6.1. FINDING SUPPORTING STATEMENTS 83\n•Anecdotal: A description of an episode(s), centered on individual(s) or clearly located in\nplace and/or in time.

The data set for training and testing the system consists\nof274articlesassociatedwith39diﬀerenttopics.Here,3,057sentenceswithcontext-dependent\nevidence were annotated. In the setting here, not all claims are associated with evidence,6but for\nthose that are, on average, a claim is connected to 2.17 evidence statements. 95% of the evidence\nstatements are full sentences.\nArticles\nContext-free S tage\nCoherence\nComponent\nEvidence Characteristic\nComponentTopic and\nRelevant Claims\n \nContext-dependent\nComponent  \n \nClaim Selection\nComponentFilter\nCandidates\nby\nCombined\nScoreRanked\nCandidates for\nSelected Claims\nRanked Candidates with\nRespect to Each Claim\nFigure 6.3: System architecture of evidence detection system based on Rinott et al. [2015, p.\n443].\nRinott et al. devised a modular system architecture shown in Figure 6.3, responding to\nthe observation that a target text segment should satisfy three criteria: it must be coherent; it\nmust have characteristics of the relevant evidence type; and ﬁnally, of course, it must support\nthe claim. Of these, the ﬁrst two aspects are context-independent. In the following, we brieﬂy\ndescribe the corresponding modules of the system.\nThecoherence component makes sure that, for example, there are no unresolved anaphors\nin a sentence and that the ﬁrst sentence does not start with a connective.\nTheevidencecharacteristics component estimates how well the candidate corresponds to\nthedesiredtypeofevidence.Studyevidence,forexample,isstronglyassociatedwithquantitative\nanalysis of data, i.e., the presence of numbers, among other features. Anecdotal evidence is\nexpected to be less semantically related to the corresponding claim, as their relationship may be\nmoreassociativethanfortheStudyorExperttypes.Foreachevidencetype,theauthorsmanually\ncompiled a lexicon of words characterizing this type. Using held-out data, these lexicons were\nautomatically expanded. Other features are named entity types, regular expressions for ﬁnding\nquotations and verb/named entity patterns, and subjectivity.\n6This violates our deﬁnition of ‘argument’, but note that these researchers treat claim and evidence detection as distinct\nresearch tasks.\n\n--- Page 97 ---\n84 6. FINDING SUPPORTING AND OBJECTING STATEMENTS\nThecontext-dependent componentaimstodetectwhetherthecandidateindeedsupports\nthe provided claim in the context of the topic. Hence, it is trained on [topic / claim / evidence]\ntriplets. Four types of features are computed:\n• semantic relatedness between the candidate and the claim;\n• semantic relatedness between text related to the candidate and the claim;\n• relative location of the candidate with respect to the claim; and\n• sentiment agreement between the candidate and the claim.\nHere, semantic relatedness is computed by several methods, including the cosine similarity be-\ntween TF-IDF vectors representing each text (augmented with related words from WordNet)\nand by cosine similarity between word embedding representations of all pairs of words from the\ntwo texts.\nFinally, the claim selection component aims to rank all input claims, according to the\nprobability that evidence can indeed be found amongst top-ranking candidates for the claim. It\nuses a lexicon of ‘claim words’ ( lead,result,development,signiﬁcant, etc.) as well as a more speciﬁc\nlexicon that diﬀerentiates words used in factual claims ( increase, important, relate, etc.) from\nthose in non–factual claims (natural,freedom,right , etc.). The lists were derived from manually-\nannotated claims.\nAll components employ a logistic regression classiﬁer. The evaluation of this multi-\ncomponent pipeline, done by the authors via mean reciprocal ranks, is complex and we do not\nreproduce it here. The authors conclude that assessing both the coherence and the evidence\ncharacteristics of candidates is of great importance. For the context-dependent stage, semantic\nrelatedness turned out as the most valuable feature.\n6.1.3 COMBINED CLAIM/SUPPORT DETECTION\nInSection 5.3,wedescribedafewapproachesthattackledtheidentiﬁcationofclaimandsupport\nsimultaneously. In order to complete our survey on ﬁnding support, we just list these approaches\nand the relevant results again.\n•Palau and Moens [2009] used the same feature set for discriminating claim and support\n(premise) in legal text, reaching an F-score of 0.68 for the premises, which was 0.06 lower\nthan that for claims.\n• The sequence kernel method employed by Rooney et al. [2012] yields much better results\nfor support than for claims; the accuracies are in the area of 0.6, depending on parameter-\nization.\n• The 4-way SVM classiﬁer developed by Stab and Gurevych [2014b] had an F-score of\n0.83 for support, as compared to 0.63 and 0.54 for major claims and claims.\n\n--- Page 98 ---\n6.2. FINDING OPPOSING STATEMENTS 85\n• For the CRF model of Goudas et al. [2014] (IOB tagging for claims and support), no\nclass-speciﬁc results were given.\n• The CRF model of Habernal and Gurevych [2017] obtained slightly better results for\nsupport than for claims, but only when using diﬀerent feature sets.\n• Saint-Dizier’s rule-based approach also fared somewhat better for support than for claims.\nThus, with the exception of the work of Palau and Moens [2009], in these ‘joint’ approaches,\nthe identiﬁcation of support was easier than that of claims.\n6.2 FINDING OPPOSING STATEMENTS\nFor many application scenarios, it is important to ﬁnd both proandcontrapositions on a given\nclaim, or in other words, the arguments andcounterarguments (orattacks). This is the case, inter\nalia, for product evaluations—recall Example 6.1shown at the beginning of the chapter. When\nthecontrais present in the same text as the pro, we call this the ‘opposing view’. It is not un-\ncommon at all—and often advisable from a rhetorical perspective—for an author to anticipate\npotential counterarguments, mention them, and rebut them. (The step of identifying those will\nbe taken up in the next chapter.)\nFor illustration, here is another example from the ‘argumentative microtext’ corpus [Peld-\nszus and Stede, 2016b]; we mark (C)laim, (S)upporting, and (A)ttacking statements.\n(6.5)Should health insurance cover alternative medical therapy?\nHealth insurance companies should naturally cover alternative medical treatments. C\n[Not all practices and approaches that are lumped together under this term may have\nbeen proven in clinical trials, A[yet it’s precisely their positive eﬀect when accompanying\nconventional ’western’ medical therapies that’s been demonstrated as beneﬁcial. S\n[Besides many general practitioners oﬀer such counselling and treatments in parallel\nanyway – S[and who would want to question their broad expertise? S\n(micro_b013)\nThe author states her position up front, and then continues with a concession: there are some\nlegitimate objections to her position (or there is at least this one). However, she considers this\nobjection as being outweighed by the supporting material she then adds to complete her argu-\nment. In student essays, including such considerations is typically regarded positively by evalua-\ntors (the issue of avoiding the myside bias ). But we ﬁnd the technique in many other genres too,\nsuch as in court decisions, where the judge might concede that the defendant is right on one\nparticular count, but still deserves punishment on the grounds of other, more weighty, factors.\nUsing the terms ‘objection’ or ‘attack’ for these cases may be a bit misleading, because\nauthors rarely intend to attack themselves or argue with themselves; instead, they ‘imagine’ an\nopponent and the confrontation. We thus follow Govier [2011] and henceforth use the cover\ntermcounter-considerations for these phenomena.\n\n--- Page 99 ---\n86 6. FINDING SUPPORTING AND OBJECTING STATEMENTS\nWhen the detection of counter-considerations is operationalized as in the annotations\nof Example 6.5above, the computational task remains essentially the same as in the previous\nsection and merely adds a new class (in our example: A) to a premise/conclusion classiﬁer. Some\nannotation schemes, however, go a step further and distinguish between two forms of counter-\nconsideration: the rebuttal and the undercutter.\nPeldszus and Stede [2013], who described the scheme underlying the ‘microtext’ corpus,\nillustrate the distinction with these examples.\n(6.6) We should tear the building down. C[It is full of asbestos. S[On the other hand, many\npeople liked the view from the roof. R\n(6.7) We should tear the building down. C[It is full of asbestos. S[The building might be\ncleaned up, though. U\nIn6.6, the third statement ‘rebuts’ the conclusion by making a point that would invalidate the\nproposal of tearing the building down; it thus questions the validity of the conclusion. In con-\ntrast, the third statement of Example 6.7is directed toward the second (supporting) statement.\nIt does not question the validity of the statement “full of asbestos” (i.e., it does not rebut it), but\nit questions the relevance of the support for the conclusion: Yes, there is asbestos, but that can\nbe removed, and therefore we do not need to demolish the building. This is called an ‘undercut’\non the relation between S and C.\nNotice that in authentic text, a speaker should produce some sort of continuation to Ex-\nample6.6or6.7, so that a coherent and strong argument results. Speciﬁcally, the rebutter and\nundercutter need in turn to be countered. This leads to conﬁgurations of ‘counterattack’, which\nwe do not elaborate on here; the reader is referred to Peldszus and Stede [2013, sct. 2.2.4] for a\ncomparative analysis of various cases.\n‘Microtexts’ and newspaper editorials In his approach to parsing the argumentation struc-\nture of (the German version of) texts in the microtext corpus, Peldszus [2014] operationalized\nthe task with a hierarchical tag set, where the ﬁrst distinction is for an argumentative text seg-\nment to be stated from the ‘proponent’ or the ‘opponent’ role: either the author advances her\nown viewpoint, or temporarily adopts that of the imagined opponent and produces a counter-\nconsideration. Using a common feature set, role identiﬁcation turned out to be the subtask yield-\ning the best results (micro-F of 0.85 using a MaxEnt classiﬁer). As opponent-statements are\nobviously relatively rare (22% in this dataset) it is instructive to also consider the \u0014, which was\n0.52. The most predictive features were lemma unigrams and discourse connectives. The latter is\nnot too surprising, because switching the perspective to an imagined opponent (and then back\nagain) needs to be clearly signaled at the text surface, and contrastive connectives like butoreven\nthough are one standard way of doing that. In the sample text shown above as Example 6.5, the\nswitch signal is yetin the third segment.\nAfter some feature improvements, slightly better results ( \u0014=0.55, macro-F=0.77) were\nobtained in Peldszus and Stede [2015b]. The authors compare the results to those for a corpus\n\n--- Page 100 ---\n6.3. IDENTIFYING STANCE 87\nof German newspaper editorials (124 texts), where the results are considerably lower: \u0014=0.32,\nmacro-F=0.66; the F-score for opponent class was only 0.38. This low performance is attributed\nprimarily to the presence of longer sequences of opponent-role segments in the editorials—where\na signal of perspective switching is typically present only in the ﬁrst segment of such a sequence.\nThe microtexts, on the other hand, are simply too short for such sequences to play a role.\nStudentessays A proponent/opponent distinction is also made by Stab and Gurevych [2014a]\nin their corpus of student essays (see Section 5.3.3). The 429 segments annotated as claim have\nan additional attribute ‘for’ (365) or ‘against’ (64). The stance of the premises is not labeled cor-\nrespondingly, but in principle it can be inferred from the relational structure of the annotations.\nIn total, there are 1,473 relations annotated, of which 161 are of the attacking type. However,\ndue to the relatively low proportion, the authors restricted their automatic classiﬁcation to the\n‘for’ claims and the ‘support’ relations.\nIn follow-up work, Stab and Gurevych [2016] addressed the question of absence of the\nopposing view in essays, as this is relevant for essay grading. They did not address segments in-\ndividually but classiﬁed the complete essays as containing opposing material or not. In their cor-\npus of 402 essays, the opposing view was present in 151 (38%) of all texts. Their SVM classiﬁer\nobtained an accuracy of 0.77; lexical unigrams, syntactic productions, and adversative connec-\ntives turned out as the most predictive features, whereas sentiment and other discourse features\ndid not help.\nWebtext Theannotationschemeof HabernalandGurevych [2017](cf.Section 5.3.5),derived\nfrom the Toulmin model, contains ‘rebuttal’ for opposing material (they do not distinguish it\nfrom undercut), and ‘refutation’ for the counter-attack by the author. In their web text corpus,\nonly 8% of the documents present a rebuttal (attacked by refutation in 4% of the documents).\nIn their IOB tagging experiments, it turned out that their system performs very bad for the\nrebuttal and refutation categories (e.g., F-scores of 0.037 and 0.118 for rebuttal-B and rebuttal-\nI, respectively). The authors attribute this to a corresponding low human agreement on the one\nhand, and to the small amount of data on the other.\n6.3 IDENTIFYING STANCE\nStance detection is an NLP task in its own right that has given rise to several shared tasks, in-\ncluding one for Chinese tweets [Xu et al., 2016] and one for English ones. The organizers of\nthe latter deﬁned the task as follows [Mohammad et al., 2016, p. 31].\nGiven a tweet text and a target entity (person, organization, movement, policy, etc.),\nautomatic natural language systems must determine whether the tweeter is in favor\nof the given target, against the given target, or whether neither inference is likely.\nFor example, consider the target-tweet pair:\n•Target: Legalization of abortion.\n\n--- Page 101 ---\n88 6. FINDING SUPPORTING AND OBJECTING STATEMENTS\n•Tweet: The pregnant are more than walking incubators, and have rights!\nWe can infer from the tweet that the tweeter is likely in favor of the target.\nA connection to argumentation mining is evident in the analysis of online debates. In the most\nsystematic cases of debate, the two-sided ones, a statement or claim is presented, and debaters\nposition themselves explicitly on the ‘for’ or ‘against’ side, and ideally state arguments supporting\ntheir stance. This setting provides convenient train/test data for automatic classiﬁcation.\nAnother genre that has received some attention is news text; Ferreira and Vlachos [2016],\nfor example, present a classiﬁer for news headlines that tries to predict the stance toward the\nclaim made in the article.\nBut systems performing for/against classiﬁcation can be employed in less regulated set-\ntings, too. For instance, a system aiming at retrieving arguments on a particular topic (‘target’)\nfrom general web text needs to ﬁrst identify texts that are on topic and are argumentative; then,\nin order to identify the argument components and their roles, it can be helpful to know the\ngeneral orientation of the text—the author’s stance. And recall the point made at the beginning\nof Section 5.3: very often an argumentative text does not explicitly state its central claim. De-\npending on the speciﬁc application, stance detection may then serve as a way of inducing the\nimplicit claim in a reduced form, i.e., as a for/against label. For these reasons, in the following\nwe brieﬂy point to some relevant stance detection research.\nOnlinedebates The early work of Somasundaran and Wiebe [2009] used Integer Linear Pro-\ngramming (ILP) to determine the stance of posts from the debate site Convinceme.net. The\ndebates in their corpus are restricted to be two-sided as well as oriented to two targets: posts\neither favor one product or one speciﬁc competitor ( Blackberry vs.Iphone, etc.). In this setting,\nconcessions are relatively frequent: An author grants the ‘opposing’ product some advantage,\nbut then gives more weighty arguments for the favored product. Therefore, discourse features\ncentering on the Concession relation were exploited by Somasundaran and Wiebe, in addition\nto topic and subjectivity clues extracted from the training data.\nAnand et al. [2011], working with the same data source, emphasized the role of rebuttals\nin the interactions, which according to the authors should be treated diﬀerently from agreeing\nresponses. Figure 6.4shows a sample exchange where the three follow-up posts all are rebutting\ntheir predecessors. With Naive Bayes and decision tree classiﬁers employing a range of linguistic\nfeatures, the authors were able to identify rebuttals with 63% accuracy, and the stance with\naccuraciesbetween54%and69%,dependingonthetopic.Ageneralinsightwasthattherebuttal\nposts are harder to identify, both for human raters and for the classiﬁers.\nPicking up the work of Anand et al., Hasan and Ng [2013] suggested moving beyond the\nlanguage of the post, to also take aspects of the interaction into account. Their data is from a\ndiﬀerent website, createdebate.com, and comprises ‘ideological’ debates on four topics: abortion,\ngay rights, Obama, and marijuana. The authors propose two features.\n\n--- Page 102 ---\n6.3. IDENTIFYING STANCE 89\nFigure 6.4: Discussion posts with rebut links from Convinceme.net [Anand et al., 2011, p. 1],\nused with permission.\n•Interactionpatterns: In the data, stance labels of the posts in a sequence are not indepen-\ndent of each other: 80% of the time, a post is followed by a reply with opposite polarity. The\nauthors trained a CRF model on sequences and used it to predict such stance sequences\non the test data.\n•Ideology patterns: The opinion of an author on one topic is not independent of his or\nher opinion on another topic. Thus, for posts written by the same author, the informa-\ntion gathered from other posts can be used. Hasan and Ng modeled this as conditional\nprobabilities reﬂecting that, for instance, a pro stance on gay rights correlates with being\npro-marijuana.\nNotice that both of these features might be less helpful with less heated debate topics. But\nnonetheless, Hasan and Ng show how the two types of constraints can be combined in an ILP\ninference problem, and they demonstrate that both constraints improve overall system perfor-\nmance, which altogether beats a reimplementation of the linguistic approach of Anand et al.\n[2011] by 8–14 percentage points, depending on the domain. Later on, Hasan and Ng [2014]\nused their stance identiﬁcation results to better predict classes of reasons given for an argument\n(see Section 6.1.2).\nQiu and Jiang [2013] worked with English and Chinese debate data sets, and were also\ninterested in utilizing user interaction patterns for determining stance. In their unsupervised\n\n--- Page 103 ---\n90 6. FINDING SUPPORTING AND OBJECTING STATEMENTS\nFigure 6.5: Topics mentioned in debate posts by ‘for’ (viewpoint 1) and ‘against’ users (viewpoint\n2) [Qiu and Jiang ,2013, p. 1032], used with permission.\napproach, they built a complete network representing the ‘for’/‘against’ groups of users and the\nsupport/attack relations among them, as computed via their posts. Their main focus, however,\nwas to also pay attention to the topics mentioned in the posts, following the intuition that given\na contentious issue, the ‘for’ users tend to discuss diﬀerent aspects of that issue than the ‘against’\nusers do. Figure 6.5illustrates the idea by giving the distribution of seven topics addressed by\nusers discussing whether to vote for or against Obama. The three factors—topic distribution,\nuser identity, and user interaction—are combined in a latent variable model inspired by Latent\nDirichlet Allocation [Blei et al. ,2003]. The accuracies for stance identiﬁcation range from 60–\n81% depending on the language and data set.\nFinally, we mention the work by Sridhar et al. [2014], which combines linguistic and net-\nwork structure features and proposes to jointly infer the stance labels by means of a probabilistic\nsoft logic (PSL) model [ Bach et al., 2013]. They used data from the Internet Argument Corpus\n(see Section 4.2.1), addressing topics similar to those mentioned above, and demonstrated—in\nline with the above-mentioned work—that accounting for both types of information outper-\nforms a linguistics-only model. An interesting feature of the PSL approach is that weights of\nsymbolic rules are learned, which can be inspected and exploited for error analysis (in contrast\nto the majority of ‘black box’ machine learning approaches).\nStudent essays Besides online debate posts, another interesting genre for stance classiﬁca-\ntion is argumentative student essays that were written in response to a prompt inviting a ‘for’\nor ‘against’ opinion. Faulkner [2014] presented an approach to compute the essay-level stance\nautomatically, which uses two key ingredients.\n\n--- Page 104 ---\n6.3. IDENTIFYING STANCE 91\n• Scoring essay words for being on-topic: Faulkner uses a Wikipedia link-based measure to\ncompute the similarity between words in the essay and words in the essay’s prompt.\n• Parse trees for detecting stance expressions: With the help of a dependency parser and two\nlexical resources of stance words and attitudinal words (both taken from earlier research),\nFaulkner extracts parse subtrees that can be associated with a stance-attitude proﬁle. This\nrecords a positive/negative evaluation of a for/against stance expressed in the sentence.\nTrees are generalized by means of their PoS labels.\nThe train/test data set consist of 1,135 stance-annotated essays from the International Corpus\nof Learner English (ICLE) [ Granger ,2003]. Faulkner demonstrates that an SVM trained on\nthe topic-word model easily outperforms two baselines: bag-of-words and an implementation\nof the best-performing linguistic features from the earlier work of Somasundaran and Wiebe\n(see page 88). Adding the subtree features yields another—if slight—improvement, resulting in\nan overall accuracy of 82%.\nTopic-claim constellations The team developing the IBM argumentative structure dataset\n[Aharoni et al., 2014] also added stance annotation to their data. As we explained in Sec-\ntion5.3.4, their corpus was built by selecting debate topics from idebate.org and manually\nﬁnding claim and evidence statements in Wikipedia articles. The version of this corpus used\nbyBar-Haim et al. [2017] encompasses 55 topics and 2,394 claims. (Examples were given in\nFigure5.4on page 72.) By deﬁnition, all claims in the dataset either support or contest the topic,\nand the new annotations make this explicit. Bar-Haim et al. decompose the automatic stance\ndetection task into three subtasks.\n1. Identify the targetsof the given topic and claim. Targets (or ‘aspects’) are phrases that have\nbeen given a positive or negative evaluation by the author.\n2. For each target, identify the polarity (sentiment) that is expressed toward it.\n3. Determine whether targets are ‘consistent’ (have the same polarity orientation) or ‘con-\ntrastive’; this can involve interpreting the targets and their relationship.\nForlabelingthedata,eachofthe55topicsreceivedtargetandpolarityannotationfromthe\nauthors, and then annotators marked targets and sentiment in all the claims, and also added the\nconsistent/contrastive relation. The claim stance is then derived automatically. A few examples\nof this annotation are shown in Figure 6.6, with the relation denoted by ,and¼, and claim\nstance given in the rightmost column.\nThevariousstepswerethenimplementedassupervisedclassiﬁcationtasks,andtheauthors\nclaim that their decomposed approach beats monolithic stance classiﬁcation.\n\n--- Page 105 ---\n92 6.

We illustrate this\nwith an extended version of Example 6.1, using the subscripts C, S, A for claim, support, attack:\n(7.1) Last week I bought this new camera here. [You should also buy it,] C[because it has a\nbrand-new excellent sensor.] SIt’s sold in the tech store around the corner. [OK, it is\nquite expensive.] A[But it’s worth the money!] S\nFor some purposes and for some texts, being able to do this is suﬃcient. Sometimes,\nhowever, it is not enough.\nAssume that a text tries to persuade the reader not of one but of multiple diﬀerent claims\nand provides the accompanying arguments. Now a ﬂat labeling is insuﬃcient because we need to\nknow which argument components relate to each other: what supports what; what attacks what.\nNow we need to establish explicitrelations between components, so that the correct mapping can\nbe captured. Hence, in Section 7.1we look at the task of identifying relations between argument\ncomponents, which may be diﬀerent kinds of support and attack.\nSome approaches go a step further and aim at combining the various components of argu-\nments and the relations between them into an overarching structuralrepresentation, which is the\ntopic of Section 7.2. This is necessary for correctly capturing more complex arguments where,\nfor instance, a statement supports the claim not directly but only indirectly via an additional\nstatement; likewise, when several objections are being mentioned and refuted, the task is to ap-\npropriately record the attack and counterattack relationships and to show how they combine\ninto a coherent argumentation structure.\n7.1 ESTABLISHING RELATIONS BETWEEN ARGUMENT\nCOMPONENTS\nWhile in the previous chapters, we dealt with the task of identifying argumentative units and\nlabeling them with their roles, we now turn to a relation -based perspective, which addresses this\ntask:\n\n--- Page 107 ---\n94 7. DERIVING THE STRUCTURE OF ARGUMENTATION\nGiven two statements, determine the argumentative relation between them, such as:\nDoes one support orattackthe other?\nOne practical motivation for taking this perspective stems from the analysis of multi-party in-\nteractions, where utterances by diﬀerent speakers can be classiﬁed as being in agreement (cor-\nresponding to one utterance supporting the other) or in disagreement (one attacking the other).\nBut also when processing monologue text, relation identiﬁcation can be important, as we\nargued in the introduction above. As soon as we cannot assume that the text in question contains\njust a single argument with no internal sub-structure (or when it is not relevant to account for\nthat sub-structure), we need to explicitly mark the relations between argumentative units.\nThe dialogue and monologue settings obviously diﬀer from each other: statements are\ntaken from the utterances of diﬀerent speakers, vs. from a single, coherent text. Thus, it can be\nassumed that the linguistic form is not the same, and that somewhat diﬀerent approaches or\nfeature sets are relevant. We will discuss the two settings in turn.\n7.1.1 DISAGREEMENT IN ONLINE INTERACTIONS\nTracing the back and forth of argumentative exchanges in online interactions is a very attractive\nbut at the same time quite ambitious goal. To date, no complete solutions have been proposed\nto our knowledge, but there has been work on the initial step of identifying relations between\nindividual statements. Depending on the background (interaction analysis or argumentation\nmining), authors describe their aim either to classify agreement vs. disagreement, or support vs.\nattack (which amounts essentially to the same problem).\nAsanalyzingonlineinteractionsisobviouslyofgreatpracticalrelevance,severalcorpusan-\nnotationeﬀorts have been undertaken. Welisted some of the available resourcesin Section 4.2.1,\nincluding the information on download links. In the following, we look at work that involves\nthose resources and uses diﬀerent techniques to ﬁnd an argumentative relation.\nTextual entailment Some researchers noted the similarity between the task of establishing a\nsupport relation and that of RecognizingTextualEntailment (RTE), which is commonly deﬁned\nas follows: “A text Tentails a hypothesis Hif humans reading Twould typically infer that H\nis most likely true” [ Dagan et al., 2013, p. 3]. Notice the reliance on human judgment and the\ndiﬀerence from strict logical entailment. TE is a fairly broad relation, covering also, for instance,\nphysical causation, but it might be considered as subsuming argumentative support.\nCabrio and Villata [2012] tested how well an existing RTE tool (EDITS, Kouylekov and\nNegri[2010]), which applies an edit-distance measure, performs with pairs of argumentative\nstatements gathered from Debatepedia and labeled with support/attack relations. EDITS was\ntrained on 100 pairs and tested on 100 pairs. The authors reported a fairly promising accuracy\nof 0.67.\n\n--- Page 108 ---\n7.1. ESTABLISHING RELATIONS BETWEEN ARGUMENT COMPONENTS 95\nIn the same spirit, Boltužić and Šnajder [2014] used the Excitement open RTE platform1\n[Padó et al. ,2015] for classifying the relation between (manually created) argumentative state-\nments and comments in the the ComArg corpus (see Section 4.2.1), expecting the comment text\n(which is usually longer) to entail the argument phrase. The classiﬁcation is more diﬃcult than\nin the other work reported here, as it uses ﬁve classes: explicit attack, implicit attack, explicit\nsupport, implicit support, and none. Excitement supplies seven diﬀerent algorithms based on\ndiﬀerent types of information. Boltužić and Šnajder used the outputs (decisions and conﬁdence\nvalues) of all seven algorithms as the features in their classiﬁer, in addition to semantic similarity.\nThe RTE approach was the more successful component, contributing an overall performance of\n0.7 to a 0.82 micro-F in diﬀerent problem settings (SVM classiﬁer).\nRecently, Bosc et al. [2016a] ran a similar experiment and applied Excitement to the\nDART corpus [ Bosc et al. ,2016b], which contains 4000 Tweets dealing with four diﬀerent\ntopics. They have been annotated pairwise with support/attack relations. Trying to predict the\nreations with the RTE platform leads to negative results, however.\nInteractional structure For threaded data, features of the structure of the interaction have\nbeen found to be useful. Rosenthal and McKeown [2015], for example, experimented success-\nfully with meta-thread information in the IAC, ABCD, and AWTP data (see Section 4.2.1),\nsuch as the distance from the ﬁrst post, the post coming from the same or a diﬀerent author,\nand the length of the post.\nWhen looking at longer stretches of conversation, it can make sense to diﬀerentiate the lo-\ncal stance in a single post from the globalposition a user has on an issue. Yin et al. [2012] showed\nthat in their web forum thread data, aggregating the local positions over a user’s posts leads to\nbetter performance than no-aggregation baselines. Mukherjee and Liu [2013] added another\nshift of perspective and modeled the dis/agreement behavior of individual user pairs, thus ab-\nstracting from the task of classifying individual Question-Response pairs to pairs of sets of user\nutterances. They use topic modeling and relevance-based ranking to derive phrases indicative of\ndis/agreement as their mean features.\nLexical and linguistic features Various researchers showed that linguistically-motivated fea-\ntures can beat simple lexical n-gram models for dis/agreement classiﬁcation. For instance, the\nfeature analysis of Yin et al. [2012], who used a logistic regression model, suggested that sen-\ntiment, emotional and durational features can signiﬁcantly improve classiﬁer performance. In a\nsimilar vein, Abbott et al. [2011] worked with an early version of the Internet Argument Cor-\npus (see Section 4.2.1) and measured the relative importance of a broad range of features for\ndis/agreement detection. They found that it is important to use local features (e.g., initial n-\ngrams for approximating discourse markers such as Idon’tknow and dependency triples) of both\nthequoteandtheresponse,ratherthanfocusingontheresponsealone.Infollow-upwork,Misra\n1https://hltfbk.github.io/Excitement-Open-Platform/ (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 109 ---\n96 7. DERIVING THE STRUCTURE OF ARGUMENTATION\nand Walker [2013] emphasized the importance of ﬁnding topic-neutral features, in particular\npunctuation and cue words, for cross-domain performance of the models.\nGhosh et al. [2014] used a support vector machine to classify the agree/disagree relation\non the callout/target annotation in technically-oriented blogs from technorati.com (see Sec-\ntion4.2.1). A ‘callout’ is a statement that challenges another statement (by a diﬀerent user), the\n‘target’. The authors achieved F-scores of 0.67 and 0.63 for the agree and disagree category, re-\nspectively, using a sentiment lexicon, initial unigrams in the callout, and lexical overlap between\ncallout and target. Lexical overlap is one way to capture semantic similarity between statements,\nwhich has also been modeled by other researchers, including Boltužić and Šnajder [2014], as a\ndomain-independent measurement.\nFollowing an idea from Mukherjee and Liu [2013], Rosenthal and McKeown [2015]\ndeveloped the notion of similarity further and worked with a theoretical motivation of ‘accom-\nmodation’, i.e., the phenomenon of interlocutors adopting the conversational characteristics of\nother participants as the conversation progresses. Thus, for dis/agreement detection in the IAC,\nABCD and AWTP data (see Section 4.2.1), they used a sentence similarity tool measuring\nword/phrase overlap between Question and Response, and also computed the similarity of PoS\nn-gram overlap, the presence of social media-speciﬁc lexical material, and the distribution of\nLIWC2categories. Their results run up to an F-score of 0.78 for the ABCD corpus, and they\nprovide interesting comparative analyses of the three datasets.\nNeuralnetworks Wementionedabovethat Boscetal. [2016a]soughttodetermineattackand\nsupport relations between tweets, and found that the task is very diﬃcult when using an RTE\nplatform. In addition, the authors implemented a neural approach running on tokens encoded\nas GloVe embeddings [ Pennington et al. ,2014]. With an encoder-decoder architecture and\ntwo LSTMs (the second LSTM initialized with the last hidden state of the ﬁrst LSTM), they\nobtained results that also seem not promising (0.2 F-score for support and 0.16 for attack).\nThis work inspired Cocarascu and Toni [2017a] to try a similar approach on a set of 2,274\nsentence pairs, which are taken apparently from newspaper text, but the source is not speciﬁed\n[CarstensandToni ,2015].Whilethisdatadoesnotstemfromonlineinteraction,itissomewhat\nsimilar to the Twitter data above, in that it contains isolated sentence pairs. Examples are shown\nin Figure 7.1.3The architecture relies on two parallel LSTMs to model the two texts separately.\nThe authors experimented with both unidirectional and bidirectional LSTMs and with (trained\nor non-trained) word embeddings (also via GloVe). The two output vectors are merged and\nthe resulting vector fed to a Softmax classiﬁer, which predicts the label for the relation. They\nachieved an accuracy of 89.5% by concatenating the output of the two separate LSTMs for the\ntrained embeddings (which performed much better than untrained ones). Unexpectedly, results\nof the bidirectional LSTMs were lower than for the unidirectional ones.\n2http://liwc.wpengine.com (accessed May 28, 2018).\n3The data is available for research: https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~oc511/ACMToIT2017_dataset.xlsx (accessed Decem-\nber 9, 2018).\n\n--- Page 110 ---\n7.1. ESTABLISHING RELATIONS BETWEEN ARGUMENT COMPONENTS 97\nFigure 7.1: Sample sentence pairs and attack/support/none annotations from Carstens and Toni\n[2015, p. 33], used with permission.\n7.1.2 ARGUMENTATIVE RELATIONS IN MONOLOGUE\nAs we indicated at the beginning of the chapter, when mining arguments in monologue text, a\nﬂat labeling of argumentative roles is not suﬃcient if\n• more than one claim is present, and support/attack material must be linked to the associ-\nated claim; or\n• support and attack are directed not toward the claim but toward other argument compo-\nnents.\nThe second scenario holds for example in the case of ‘serial support’ (a transitive support con-\nstellation), as in the following example.\n(7.2) Vaccines are bad for kids! 1[They can cause all sorts of allergy problems. 2[A recent\nstudy reported a siginiﬁcant increase in allergic skin irritations. 3\nHere segment 1 represents the claim, which is supported by segment 2. Segment 3, however\ndoes not directly support the main claim, but provides evidence for segment 2, which thus plays\nboth the roles of support (for 1) and a minor claim (for 3).\nSimilarly, as we indicated in the previous chapter, once counter-considerations are ad-\nmitted to the argument analysis, it is very likely that ‘counter-attack’ enters the picture, since a\nspeaker probably is not going to let a possible objection just stand as is. Then, the counter-attack\nis obviously directed to the counter-consideration.\n(7.3) Vaccines are bad for kids! 1[I’ve seen some reports claiming tremendous infection\nreduction rates, 2[but those must have been sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. 3\nHere, segment 2 is a counter-consideration to claim 1, yet it is immediately rejected by 3. In\nsimilar ways, it is possible for a speaker to give a counter-consideration and then to add potential\nevidence to it, before dismissing the entire move by means of a counter-attack.\n\n--- Page 111 ---\n98 7. DERIVING THE STRUCTURE OF ARGUMENTATION\nGenerally,weareheremoving toward recursion inargumentativestructure.Wewill discuss\nthis in more detail in the next section on identifying full structures, but for now, establishing\nindividual relations between components is a central intermediate step. The task is essentially\nthe same as that described above for dialogue: given a pair of argumentative units, classify their\nrelationship as support, attack, or none (or some more ﬁne-grained subclasses of support and\nattack, but in practice that is only rarely done).\nNote that the extraction of semantic/pragmatic relations is well known in other branches\nof NLP, too. Most often, the focus is on relations between entities, but sometimes, relations\nbetween events are also being considered (for example, causal relations in biomedical text, as\nin the BioCause corpus.4) Furthermore, as we mentioned in Section 2.6and elsewhere, the\nautomatic identiﬁcation of discourse relations, for instance along the lines of the Penn Discourse\nTreebank [Prasad et al., 2008] is a well-known task. In the following, however, we only report\nwork that has been explicitly geared toward argumentation.\nRule-basedidentiﬁcation In the early work of Palau and Moens [2009] on legal documents,\nclassiﬁers were used for ﬁnding argumentative sentences and determining their role, as we re-\nported above. Connections between the components are then established by means of a context-\nfree grammar that checks for predeﬁned cue words and punctuation symbols, identiﬁes the non-\nterminal constituents as premises or conclusions, and joins them in a recursive tree structure. The\nevaluation yielded an accuracy of 60%. However, it is very diﬃcult to adapt the approach to other\ndomains, especially if the role of conventionalized, formulaic expressions is limited.\nFeature-based classiﬁcation Working with texts from the argumentative microtext corpus\n(see Section 4.2.2), Peldszus [2014] operationalized relation detection as a combination of clas-\nsifying the argumentative function of an ADU in isolation (thesis, support, attack) and the dis-\ntance to the target unit, i.e., the unit being supported or attacked. Since the texts are short (on\naverage, roughly 5 units), this usually ranges between -4 (four units to the left of the classiﬁed\none) and +4 (four units to the right). Peldszus used lexical, morphosyntactic, positional, and cue\n(connectives, negation) features and experimented with a variety of classiﬁers. He found that a\nNaive Bayes approach worked best for the support/attack/thesis distinction (F-measure 0.74)\nas well as for a more ﬁne-grained version that distinguishes ‘normal’ from ‘example’ support\nand ‘undercut’ from ‘rebut’ (F-measure 0.67). Connectives, lemma n-grams, and dependencies\nturned out to be the most helpful features. Finding the right target, however, proved to be very\ndiﬃcult,andthusinfollow-upwork, PeldszusandStede [2015a]insteadusedanout-of-the-box\ndiscourse parser [Baldridge et al., 2007] for predicting segment attachment, reaching a macro-F\nmeasure of 0.73, with F being 0.56 for positive attachment.\nA similar result was obtained by Stab and Gurevych [2014b] for the more complex texts\nin the corpus of persuasive student essays (see Section 4.2.2). For illustration, here is an excerpt\n4http://www.nactem.ac.uk/biocause/ (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 112 ---\n7.1. ESTABLISHING RELATIONS BETWEEN ARGUMENT COMPONENTS 99\nfrom such a text. Subscripts show the unit number, the relation type and target (if any), and the\nargumentative function.\n(7.4) People who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear\ndangerous consequences. 1IClaim [Although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial\npart of human life, 2>3IP remise [it still has its bad side. 3IMajorClaim\nThe approach disregarded the attack relation and thus solved the binary task of classifying pairs\nof segments as to whether one is in support relation with the other or not.5Using similar fea-\ntures as Peldszus [2014], but adding also word pairs of the two segments, and the results of an\nargumentative-function classiﬁer (which assigned the labels Claim, Major Claim, Premise), this\nled to a macro F-score of 0.72, and 0.52 for positive attachment.\nTopic modeling On the same essay corpus, Nguyen and Litman [2016] also addressed the\nsupport detection task, using the same corpus setup as Stab and Gurevych. For non-/support,\nthey re-implemented and slightly expanded the feature set, obtaining roughly the same results,\nwhich served as a baseline. Then, Nguyen and Litman showed that their technique of LDA-\nbased diﬀerentiation between ‘argument words’ and ‘domain words’, which we described above\nin Section 5.3.3, can lead to superior results. They used the presence of argument words as binary\nfeatures, and several features measuring the domain word overlap between the two segments.\nHere is an example, with argument words in bold face and domain words in italics [ Nguyen and\nLitman, 2016, p. 1131].\n(7.5) Essay 54.

The best results were achieved\nwith the same combination of features as in the ﬁrst task, with a macro-F of 0.7. Note, though,\nthe huge diﬀerence between the F-score for support (0.94) and for attack (0.4).\nSome other researchers experimented with topic modeling features, too. Lawrence et al.\n[2014], for example, measured topical distance between argumentative units in philosophical\npapers, thus targeting a much harder type of text. However, the method was only evaluated on\na very small data set and thus cannot be compared with the other research.\n5Hence, ‘no support’ subsumes both the cases of attack and zero relation.\n\n--- Page 113 ---\n100 7. DERIVING THE STRUCTURE OF ARGUMENTATION\n7.2 IDENTIFYING COMPLETE ARGUMENT\nSTRUCTURES\nHaving considered all the prerequisite subtasks, we are now well prepared to study approaches\nthat are interested in identifying the complete structures of arguments. Notice, however, that we\nrestrict the discussion here to individual arguments—or, in the terminology of Bentahar et al.\n[2010], to the micro-level of argumentation. In contrast, the macro-level , which would represent\nrelationships between diﬀerent arguments (possibly across diﬀerent documents), is out of our\nscope.\nGiven the variety of approaches to the subtasks we surveyed thus far, it does not come as\na surprise that—in this young research ﬁeld—there is no general consensus on what exactly is\nan appropriate description of an argument’s structure. But we can identify a few general lines of\nresearch. First of all, it is important to distinguish between these.\n•Hierarchical structure: Text segments are identiﬁed as argumentative units, these are\nbeing related to one another and ultimately to the single claim, yielding a graph structure;\nand\n•Sequential structure: Any argument in text is presented in a certain linear order of the\nunits, which inﬂuences rhetorical (and possibly even logical) felicity.\nHierarchical structure, by design, abstracts linear order away, and provides an extract that serves\nto represent the ‘logos’ dimension6of argumentation, i.e., the inferential relations of statements\nsupporting (or attacking) another. In contrast, linear order is closely related to ‘pathos’, the\npersuasive eﬀects intended by the speaker. So far, most work in structure derivation has concen-\ntrated on hierarchy. We will discuss these approaches ﬁrst, and then come back to the sequential\nstructure at the end of the section.\n7.2.1 COMPUTING HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE\nAs stated in Section 4.1, the prevalent conception for representing (and annotating) argument\nstructure is that of a tree rooted in the central claim of the text. Besides purely theoretical con-\nsiderations, evidence for this stems from data analysis and from experiences with annotation\npractice. For instance, Lawrence et al. [2014, p. 81] point out that “in many cases an argument\ncan be represented as a tree. This assumption is supported by around 95% of the argument anal-\nyses contained in AIFdb [ Lawrence et al., 2012] as well as the fact that many manual analysis\ntools (...) limit the user to a tree format.” A sample tree from the argumentative microtext corpus\n(see Section 4.2.2) is shown below in Figure 7.2.\nIn contrast, the annotation of eRulemaking comments by Niculae et al. [2017] regards\ntrees as unsuitable for capturing the argumentation structure in less well-organized texts. In the\n6Recall the logos/pathos/ethos dimensions described on page 5.\n\n--- Page 114 ---\n7.2.

DERIVING THE STRUCTURE OF ARGUMENTATION\nfollowing, we ﬁrst look at diﬀerent ways that have been proposed for computing trees, and in\nthe end brieﬂy describe Niculae et al.’s approach to predicting graphs.\nRule-basedparsing The early rule-based work by Palau and Moens [2009] (cf. Section 5.3.1)\ncomputedpremise-conclusiontrees,withanadditionalunittype‘decision’,bymeansofacontext\nfree grammar (CFG) model. The resulting trees can include serial support as well as convergent\nstructures. Relation types are not represented in the tree, however. The other grammar-driven\napproach that we have mentioned before (Section 5.3.2) is that of Saint-Dizier [2012]: Using a\nlogic- and constraint-based grammar language, which was designed to extend linguistic analysis\nfrom the level of sentence to that of discourse, his system determines the boundaries of various\ntypes of spans and produces embedded structures.\nTemplate slot ﬁlling When the target representation is a predeﬁned set of (possibly related)\ncomponents, the analysis can be framed as a slot-ﬁlling process. Recall the Modiﬁed Toulmin\nScheme used by Habernal and Gurevych [2017], which was illustrated on page 49. When deﬁn-\ning which components are obligatory and which are optional (and possibly, which ones can occur\nmultiple times), these expectations can be used to guide the assignment of argumentative units\nto component types (or ‘slots’ in the schema). Habernal and Gurevych, however, used a diﬀerent\nparadigm, to be descibed next.\nSegment-wise classiﬁcation A classiﬁcation-based approach can be applied to a pre-deﬁned\nsequence of segments, or it can combine segmentation and labeling decisions. The latter was im-\nplemented in the IOB tagging approaches of Goudas et al. [2014] and Habernal and Gurevych\n[2017] (see Section 5.3.5). Of these, Habernal and Gurevych used a much richer type set (that\nof the Modiﬁed Toulmin Scheme) and thus produced a ‘full’ argument structure in the sense of\na pre-deﬁned set of components. Notice that recursion is not accounted for in such a tagging\nregime; there is no serial support, for instance. It is, however, possible to assign the same type\nmore than once.\nA pre-segmented short text is the input to the classiﬁer of Peldszus [2014]. Using the\nannotation scheme encoded in the argumentative microtext corpus (see Sections 4.1and4.2.2),\nthe system can produce recursive structures, where supporting or attacking statements can in\nturn be supported, etc. An example tree is shown in Figure 7.2. The system therefore needs to\naccount explicitly for relations and does so by encoding all the information about a segment in\na complex label. This includes the target segment of the relation, denoted by \u0000n : : : Cnwith n\nbeing the distance to the target (either to the left or to the right). Even though the ‘microtexts’\nused by Peldszus were quite short, target identiﬁcation proved to be very hard in this approach.\nMinimum-spanningtree(MST)algorithm Having observed that an oﬀ-the-shelf discourse\nparser performs quite well on detecting the target segment of a relation, Peldszus and Stede\n[2015a] proposed a parsing technique for predicting the tree structure of argumentation in the\n‘microtext’ corpus. The ﬁrst stage of the system employs an improved version of the segment\n\n--- Page 116 ---\n7.2. IDENTIFYING COMPLETE ARGUMENT STRUCTURES 103\nclassiﬁer introduced by Peldszus [2014], which for a segment determines probabilities for being\ncentral claim, proponent or opponent’s voice, and support or attack function; and for a pair of\nsegments, whether they are connected. The information gathered about the segments was then\nmapped to a fully connected weighted graph, where the weights represent the predictions made\nby the local classiﬁers. Then, an implementation of the standard MST algorithm [ Chu and Liu ,\n1965,Edmonds ,1967] decoded the optimal structure. A central step in this approach is the\nspeciﬁc way of ‘translating’ the numerical results of segment classiﬁcation into the appropriate\nedge weights in the graph. The system achieved an F-score of 0.72 for identifying argumentative\nrelations and 0.87 for recognizing claims.\nIntegerlinearprogramming(ILP) BesidesMST,anothercandidateforoptimizingtheglobal\nstructure is ILP. The key is to specify a suitable objective function to be maximized, as well as\nconstraints on the target structure to be built, which then guide the search. Afantenos et al.\n[2018] suggest various groups of such constraints, including the following.\n•Treeconstraints: All nodes have one or no outgoing edge; the root node has no outgoing\nedge; cycles are ruled out.\n•Relation labeling : Every node has exactly one function (support or attack).\n•Interactions :Therootnode(centralclaim)mustbeinproponent’svoice;asupportrelation\ncan hold only between nodes in the same voice, etc.\nImplementations of tree prediction in an ILP framework have been proposed by Persing and\nNg[2016], Stab and Gurevych [2017b], and Afantenos et al. [2018], using either the persuasive\nessay corpus of Stab and Gurevych [2014a] (Persing/Ng) or the microtext corpus (Afantenos et\nal.), or both (Stab/Gurevych). Results are not directly comparable due to diﬀerent versions of\nthe essay corpus being used, and somewhat diﬀerent feature sets. All authors, however, report\nimprovementsoverpreviouspipeline-basedapproaches.Afantenosetal.alsoreplicatedtheother\ntwo approaches as well as the MST approach of Peldszus and Stede [2015a] and provide a\ncomparative analysis.\nNeuralnetworks One of the ﬁrst NN experiments on the persuasive essay and microtext cor-\npora was done by Potash et al. [2017]. The authors solved the tasks of predicting argument\ncomponents (claim, major claim, premise) and link detection (i.e., unlabeled relations), and they\narrive at a tree structure. They propose that sequence-to-sequence attention modeling, speciﬁ-\ncally a Pointer Network [Vinyals et al., 2015] is well suited for this problem, as it can capture the\nsequential information of argument components, partly enforce the tree structure, and jointly\npredict multiple subtasks with the hidden representations. For representing components, the\nsystem uses bag-of-words, GloVe embeddings, and positional features. Despite the relatively\nsmall amount of training data in the two corpora, the authors report results that outperform\nthose of the ILP approaches by Peldszus and Stede [2015a] and Stab and Gurevych [2017b]\n\n--- Page 117 ---\n104 7. DERIVING THE STRUCTURE OF ARGUMENTATION\nfor the subtasks that are being addressed here. They also conﬁrm the earlier insight that joint\noptimization (here for segment type and linking) is clearly better than combining individual\nsolutions.\nEger et al. [2017] also ran a number of NN experiments on the persuasive essay corpus.\nAs a potential advantage of neural sequence tagging models, they point out that (at least in this\ncorpus) related ADUs need not be adjacent but, on the contrary, can be at a fairly long distance\nfrom each other; this is a well-known problem for CRF-like models. For ADU identiﬁcation,\nEger et al. obtained best results from a BiLSTM tagger. Identifying support and attack relations\nwas a harder task, but still they achieved better results with an LSTM than the ILP approach\nofStab and Gurevych [2017b] did.\nPredictinggraphs In Section 4.1, we described the Cornell eRulemaking annotation scheme,\nwhich uses general graphs rather than trees for representing argmentation, and employs a set\nof role and relation labels that is more domain-speciﬁc than those used in the work described\nabove. For building such graphs over pre-segmented input, Nicolae et al. use structured learning.\nThey cast the problem in a factor graph approach [Kschischang et al., 2001], which can fully\nlearn the correlations between role assignment and linking, and does not rely on handcrafted\nscoring, as via the objective function in ILP. Inference is done by the Alternating Directions\nDual Decomposition (AD3) algorithm. For parameterization, the authors experimented with\ntwo approaches: a linear structured SVM using the features proposed by Stab and Gurevych\n[2014b] for role identiﬁcation and linking, and a bidirectional LSTM that encodes context for\na segment represented as the average of the LSTM outputs of the words therein. Niculae et al.\nevaluated the approach on their own eRulemaking corpus as well as the persuasive essay corpus\nfrom Stab and Gurevych. For the latter, they obtained competitive results on the link prediction\ntask. Generally, the feature engineering SVM approach outperforms the RNN, which, however,\nyields very good results on unit type classiﬁcation in the persuasive essays.\n7.2.2 SEQUENTIAL STRUCTURE\nA tree or graph structure represents the logical gist of an argument, which for many purposes is\nuseful and may constitute the ﬁnal result of argumentation mining. But it should be noted that\ninformation about the linear order of the argument components found in the text is essentially\nneglected by the approaches shown in the previous subsection. So far, aspects of the linearization\nof texts have received only little attention in argumentation mining. To some extent, the step of\nconstructingagraphmayexploitlocalityconstraintsbypreferringadjacentunitswhenpredicting\nargumentativerelations;butbeyondthisconsideration,aspectsoflinearordertendtobeignored.\nOn the other hand, the fact that linear order does matter has received quite a bit of atten-\ntion in rhetoric (cf. Section 2.6). A simple example of its relevance is the A,butB pattern, which\nis known to express not just a symmetrical contrast but to assign diﬀerent weights to AandB.\n(7.6) The party has good ideas, but the leader is quite dumb. I won’t vote for them.\n\n--- Page 118 ---\n7.2. IDENTIFYING COMPLETE ARGUMENT STRUCTURES 105\n(7.7) The leader is quite dumb, but the party has good ideas. I will vote for them.\nNote that switching the order of AandBin either case (or, alternatively, switching the negation)\nproduces odd results. This general insight can be extended to the text level; for instance, popular\nadvice from rhetorics guidebooks suggests to place your ‘best’ argument maybe at the beginning\nof your text, or at the end, but deﬁnitely not in the middle. And plenty of more sophisticated\nrecipes are being studied for their persuasive power.\nBuilding upon ideas on assigning types to ADUs (recall, e.g., the work on ‘argumentative\nzoning’ mentioned in Section 2.6),Wachsmuth and Stein [2017] suggest to model an argumen-\ntation strategy as a sequence of rhetorical moves. They study diﬀerent sets of move types, such\nas sentiment values (positive, negative, neutral), discourse relations (background, cause, circum-\nstance, ...), or argumentative moves (claim, premise, none, ...). No matter what the type set is,\nthe underlying computational problem is the same: given a segmented text and a classiﬁer that\nassigns a move to each segment, the result is a sequence of labels, which Wachsmuth and Stein\ncall a ‘ﬂow’. The idea is to explore attributes of these ﬂows for predicting properties of the text,\nfor example its persuasiveness. This presupposes, however, that ﬂows of diﬀerent texts can be\nindividually compared, and subsequently analyzed for commonalities, e.g., by clustering algo-\nrithms. Comparing ﬂows is not trivial, though, because texts (and thus ﬂows) are of diﬀerent\nlengths. Wachsmuth and Stein experiment with various techniques for normalizing ﬂows to a\nunit length, so that follow-up computations are possible. Figure 7.3illustrates the overall idea.\nNormalized/abstracted Flow Outp ut Class or Value One Similarity Value for Each Flow Pattern\nNeutral1\nCom puting\nSimilarities2\nLearning\nPrediction\nFigure 7.3: Illustration of the ‘ﬂow’ comparison/clustering approach to predicting text features.\nA dot represents a text segment, and its color represents its type based on [Wachsmuth and\nStein,2017, p. A:7].\nOne more instantiation of this approach was presented by Al-Khatib et al. [2017], who\napply it to newspaper editorials. The three moves of interest are types of evidence given for a\nclaim:statistics,testimony, andanecdote .Sinceaﬂowmustcapturethetextcompletely,everyother\nsegment receives the label other. These moves have been manually annotated on the 300 texts\nof the Webis Editorials corpus (see Section 4.2.2), and this data was used to build a classiﬁer.\n\n--- Page 119 ---\n106 7. DERIVING THE STRUCTURE OF ARGUMENTATION\nThe features were diﬀerent kinds of n-grams (including token, character, chunk, PoS), sentence\nlength and position, NE type distribution, and sentiment. With an SVM, all groups of features\nwere found to be useful, and the resulting F1-scores for the three important categories range\nbetween 0.5 and 0.59, while that for ‘other’ is 0.87.\nThis classiﬁer was then used to label a corpus of 29,000 editorials from the NewYorkTimes\ncorpus, which in addition have all been assigned to a broad topic class (such as economics, arts,\nhealth, etc.) by a Naive Bayes classiﬁer. Al-Khatib et al. then applied the ﬂow normalization al-\ngorithmand wereable tocorrelateﬂowpatternswith thetopics: Signiﬁcantdiﬀerencesemerged,\nfrom which the authors concluded that the topic of an editorial inﬂuences the ﬂow pattern se-\nlected by the author (and, in addition, the proportional distribution of evidence types, as shown\nin a separate experiment).\nFinally,wementiontheworkof Wachsmuthetal. [2017a],whodemonstratethatforthree\ndownstream tasks (computing argumentative text genre, myside bias in arguments, and stance),\nthe prediction beneﬁts from considering boththe explicit linear order of an argumentative text,\nand its implicit hierarchical structure. The authors propose a positional tree kernel model that is\nable to combine the sequence and hierarchy information.\n\n--- Page 120 ---\n107\nC H A P T E R 8\nAssessing Argumentation\nWhile ﬁnding argument components and possibly arranging them in a tree or graph structure\nconstitute the core tasks of argumentation mining, there is a small body of research aiming at\ngoing further and computing ‘deeper’ information about arguments. The ﬁrst to be considered\nhere is the problem of detecting enthymemes, which amounts to construing the (logically) miss-\ning premises for an argument to make sense. Similarly, one can try to identify the underlying\nreasoning pattern or argumentation scheme (cf. Section 3.3), which explains why (or not) a par-\nticular constellation of inferences works. Finally, we discuss work on the quality of arguments,\nwhich encompasses both measuring how ‘good’ an argument is, as well as a set of various other\nattributes that researchers have drawn attention to.\n8.1 RECONSTRUCTING ENTHYMEMES\nEnthymemes are arguments that can be understood by a hearer only if she considers the given\nclaim and premise, and reconstructs a ‘hidden’ premise that provides the link between the two.\nIn the argumentation literature, these are often called minorpremise (stated) and majorpremise\n(unstated). A classical example is as follows.\n(8.1) Minor (stated) premise: Socrates is human.\nMajor (unstated) premise: All humans are mortal.\nClaim/Conclusion (stated): Therefore, Socrates is mortal.\nMore examples from real-life text will follow below. Enthymemes are a very natural phe-\nnomenon, as already pointed out by Aristotle: when a (logically necessary) premise represents\na fact that can be assumed as known to the hearer, then the speaker can leave this premise im-\nplicit in an argument. The hearer then needs to activate her common knowledge to perform the\nreconstruction [Walton, 2008].\nNot surprisingly, this reconstruction task is very diﬃcult to automate—so far, only very\nfew preliminary studies have been done in the argumentation mining community. Wyner et al.\n[2010] provided a manual pilot study on major (implicit) premises in online discussions. They\nﬁrst annotated the premises in a variant of ‘Controlled English’ (i.e., a simpliﬁed and semi-\nformalized language) and then deﬁned propositional logic axioms to explicate the stances of\ndiscussion participants. Overall, this serves as an illustration of the kind of knowledge required\nfor an in-depth treatment of enthymemes. Focusing more on the problem of manually annotat-\n\n--- Page 121 ---\n108 8. ASSESSING ARGUMENTATION\ning enthymemes, Razuvayevskaya and Teufel [2017] explored several variants of operationaliz-\ning the task and provide suggestions on how to reach suﬃcient inter-annotator agreement.\nIn another pilot study, which makes a connection to opinion mining in product reviews,\nRajendran et al. [2016] propose linking the handling of implicit opinions (those that on the\nsurface look like factual statements but contain an implicit evaluation) to enthymeme recon-\nstruction. Their idea is to classify an opinion statement as to whether it is implicit or explicit,\nand to regard an explicit statement together with the overall judgment on the product (as derived\nfrom the rating given with the review) as complete arguments: The reviewer likes product X be-\ncause of Y. Implicit opinions, on the other hand, when combined with the conclusion can create\nan enthymeme. Then, common knowledge is necessary to complete the argument—which is the\nmajor unsolved problem.\nTheotherresearchperspectiveonenthymemesis:whatisactuallycomputationallyfeasible\nin practice? From this angle, Boltužić and Šnajder [2016] saw an analogy between major/minor\npremise on the one hand and the claim/claim type pairs that were collected by Hasan and Ng\n[2014], mentioned on page 82. These authors had gathered the reasons that authors provide for\ntheir stance toward an issue of public debate, clustered those reasons, and formulated a meta-\nstatement describing each cluster. Three examples are given on the left hand side of Figure 8.1:\nThe ‘user claim’ is from the forum post, and the ‘main claim’ is the abstract meta-statement\nprovided by Hasan and Ng.\nLike Hasan and Ng, Boltužić and Šnajder tackled the problem of matching user claims\nto main claims (or in other words: given a user claim, ﬁnd the appropriate main claim). But\nhere the idea is to explore the ‘gap’ between the two types of claim, which Boltužić and Šnajder\nproposed to ﬁll with additional premises. This step amounts to making implicit major premises\nexplicit, i.e., to enthymeme reconstruction. Annotators added the major premises to the origi-\nnal Hasan/Ng dataset,1following the instruction to formulate statements that ‘bridge the gap’.\nIn Figure 8.1, the top claim pair has been annotated with two implicit major premises, while\nannotators identiﬁed the other two pairs as non-matching or not in need of any explication,\nrespectively. The authors regard the number of major premises as a measure of the size of the in-\nferential gap (in their corpus, the average is 2.7). To gather evidence for this hypothesis, Boltužić\nand Šnajder ran a crowdsourcing experiment to obtain judgments on the semantic similarity be-\ntween the user claim and main claim, and they indeed found a statistically signiﬁcant (though\nweak) negative correlation between semantic similarity and gap size.\nNext, the authors turned to the question whether the annotated gold premises can support\nthe task of matching user claims to the given set of main claims. They computed semantic simi-\nlarity between claim sentences via cosine distance, where the vectors were produced by summing\nup the embedding vectors for each word of a sentence. Having tested various operationalizations\nfor making use of the major premises, they found that combining the premises with the main\nclaim, and then running the similarity computations, is the best approach.\n1And the result is in turn made available: http://takelab.fer.hr/data/argpremises/ (accessed December 9, 2018).\n\n--- Page 122 ---\n8.2. IDENTIFYING ARGUMENTATION SCHEMES 109\nFigure 8.1: Examples of claim pairs annotated with implicit premises [Boltužić and Šnajder ,\n2016, p. 127], used with permission.\nThe obvious next question is whether it is possible to infer the major premises automat-\nically; Boltužić and Šnajder conducted some ﬁrst experiments but these were not particularly\nsuccessful.\n8.2 IDENTIFYING ARGUMENTATION SCHEMES\nIn Section 3.3, we explained the notion of ‘argumentation scheme’ as put forward by Walton\net al.[2008], Rigotti and Greco Morasso [2010], and others. The central idea is to specify on\nwhat grounds a support or attack relation is supposed to hold among two ADUs, or in other\nwords, what the underlying inferential motif is. A central assumption of this line of research is\nthat a reasonably small set of such inferential patters can adequately describe the range of pos-\nsibilities. For illustration, from the scheme set proposed by Walton et al. [2008], we reproduce\ntheArgument from positive consequences scheme (p. 332).\n• Premise: If A is brought about, good consequences will plausibly occur.\n\n--- Page 123 ---\n110 8. ASSESSING ARGUMENTATION\n• Therefore, A should be brought about.\n• Critical questions:\n–How strong is the likelihood that the cited consequences will (may, must) occur?\n–What evidence supports the claim that the cited consequences will (may, must) occur,\nand is it suﬃcient to support the strength of the claim adequately?\n–Are there other opposite consequences (bad as opposed to good, for example) that\nshould be taken into account?\nThe critical questions point to potential objections and thereby guide the speaker in back-\ning up the argument where necessary. Schemes have received some, but not too much attention\nin argumentation mining research. When premises and conclusions have been identiﬁed in a\ntext, it is generally very diﬃcult to reliably identify the underlying scheme automatically.\nAn early corpus annotated with scheme information was Araucaria DB [ Reed et al. ,\n2008a]. Some more recent work that assesses the feasibility of human scheme annotation, and\nsuggests to exploit such data for argumentation mining, will be described in the ﬁrst subsection\nbelow. The actual automatic labeling of scheme information has been addressed only rarely so\nfar; it is the topic of the second subsection.\n8.2.1 HUMAN ANNOTATION STUDIES\nNot surprisingly, deciding on the kind of inference underneath an argumentative move involves\nsubjective judgment to a large extent, and accordingly, it is not easy to obtain good results in\nagreement studies. For example, Reisert et al. [2017] started from Walton’s argument from con-\nsequences (one variant is shown just above) and aimed at operationalizing it for argumentation\nmining by mapping it to a pattern instantiation task, where slots are characterized by their pos-\nitive or negative consequences for participants of the event described. The authors suggested 24\nsuch patterns in total (covering both support and attack under this argumentation scheme) and\napplied it to 20 texts from the ‘microtext’ corpus [ Peldszus and Stede ,2016b]. For two anno-\ntators, however, they reached a rather low kappa ranging from 0.19–0.43 depending on how\nstrictly agreement is deﬁned.\nMusi et al. [2016] developed guidelines for annotating schemes according to the ‘Argu-\nmentum model of topics’ of Rigotti and Greco Morasso [2010]. The authors favor this approach\nover Walton’s, because the 15 schemes are organized in a hierarchy that more explicitly aims at\ndevising mutually exclusive categories. Also, the deﬁnitions refer to semantic properties of the\nparticipating entities rather than to the logical inference steps. They applied the approach to 30\ntexts from the persuasive essay corpus of Stab and Gurevych [2014a], and report a Fleiss \u0014of\njust 0.1, but this involves nine, only lightly trained annotators. An informative error analysis,\n\n--- Page 124 ---\n8.2. IDENTIFYING ARGUMENTATION SCHEMES 111\nincluding a follow-up experiment, is provided. The annotation guidelines and data are available\nfor research.2\nFigure 8.2: Distribution of argumentation schemes in Wikipedia page deletion discussion cor-\npus [Schneider et al. ,2013b, p. 28].\nA larger study, which uses the scheme catalogue of Walton et al. [2008], was performed\nbySchneider et al. [2013b]. In several rounds of annotation, 741 messages from 72 debates on\nWikipedia Talk Pages (discussing whether a certain page should be deleted) were labeled. In\nthe ﬁrst phase, the authors found that 17 of the Walton-type schemes were applicable to the\ndata. Then, two annotators labeled the arguments in each message with one of these schemes,\nand reached a \u0014of 0.48. In the ﬁnal corpus of 1,213 arguments, the authors determined the\nmost common schemes—see Figure 8.2. The distribution, according to the authors, reﬂects the\nfocus on precedent and rules, which is typical for this genre, and furthermore a tendency to\ndiscussWikipediaarticlesintermsofvaluesandcommunitynorms.Theauthorsalsodetermined\ndiﬀerences in scheme usage of novices vs. experts participating in the debates; some results\nare also shown in the ﬁgure. Generally, the study found that the most prevalent patterns are\nthe ‘Rules’ and ‘Evidence to Hypothesis’ schemes from the Walton scheme catalogue (36% of\narguments), and that familiarity with community norms correlates with the novices’ ability to\ncraft persuasive arguments. Also, the study looked into the success of arguments in the course\nof a debate, and found that successful arguments tend to use a rhetoric that is in line with the\n2https://github.com/musielena/argscheme_aclworkshop2016 (accessed Sep 28. 2017).\n\n--- Page 125 ---\n112 8. ASSESSING ARGUMENTATION\npolicies and values established in the community, while unsuccessful arguments are mostly based\non personal preference or on inappropriate analogy to other cases.\nLikewise in the tradition of Walton’s approach, Song et al. [2014] exploited the role of the\ncritical questions for purposes of writing support. As stated in the beginning, these questions can\nserve to guide a writer in building up a successful argument, and the hypothesis of Song et al. was\nthat adherence to such conventionalized rules in fact distinguishes good from bad essay writers.\nThe authors found that the original Walton scheme catalogue is occasionally diﬃcult to work\nwith (due to ambiguity), and hence they made modiﬁcations; eventually they used three schemes\n(policy, causal, sample), each associated with various sub-categories and critical questions, for\ntheir essay annotation study. Two prompts were selected, and for each, 4 trained annotators\nlabeled 300 texts. Agreement was calculated for a subset of 40 essays: for common schemes and\ncategories, the pairwise \u0014ranged between 0.55 and 0.85, while rare categories proved to be more\ndiﬃcult to agree on.\nFinally, we mention the work of Green [2015], who works on scientiﬁc papers, which\ngenerally are not yet heavily studied in argumentation mining. Green found the schemes from\nthe ‘standard’ approaches not directly applicable and devised 10 schemes on her own, which she\nfound to represent the major forms of argumentation for scientiﬁc claims in 4 genetics papers.\nOnly some of these schemes overlap with the catalogue of Walton et al. [2008]. To evaluate\nthe approach in a pilot study, Green worked with about 30 subjects and determined to what\nextent schemes were recognized, by means of test questions that had to be answered [Green ,\n2015]. Subsequently, a second pilot study tested whether 6 subjects from biology and computer\nscience research could consistently apply 5 common schemes, this time deﬁned contextually\nwith genetics-speciﬁc concepts [ Green, 2017]. Green has begun to investigate applying these\nschemes in combination with semantic types such as genes, mutations, proteins, and phenotypes\nwhich can be detected by generic bioNLP tools [Green, 2018].\n8.2.2 AUTOMATIC SCHEME LABELING\nExperiments on automatically labeling texts with scheme information have been rare so far. One\ninitial study was done by Song et al. [2014] on the above-mentioned essay annotations. They\ntrained a logistic regression classiﬁer to determine whether a sentence raises critical questions or\nnot (which is relevant for essay scoring), using n-grams, positional and PoS features, as well as\nlexical overlap between sentence and prompt. The crucial question for this task is how well the\nmodel generalizes across prompts. When training and testing on data including both prompts,\nthe system reached a performance of \u0014=0.44, but when training on one and testing on the other,\nthe average is only 0.26.\nFocusing on the core schemes rather than the critical questions, Feng and Hirst [2011]\ntackled the problem of automatically assigning one of the ﬁve most frequent schemes from Wal-\nton et al. [2008] to pairs of premise and conclusion (which are assumed as given already) taken\nfrom the Araucaria DB data [ Reed et al., 2008a]. The schemes are: argument from example,\n\n--- Page 126 ---\n8.3. DETERMINING ARGUMENT QUALITY 113\nfrom cause to eﬀect, from consequences, from verbal classiﬁcation, and practical reasoning. The\nauthors used positional features (absolute and relative, for premise and conclusion), length of\nthe two components, the number of premises, as well as some scheme-speciﬁc features (largely\ncue phrases). In a separate experiment, they measured the impact of additionally specifying the\ntype of argumentation structure (linked versus convergent) to the classiﬁer.\nIn one-against-others classiﬁcation via a C4.5 decision tree, the system produced rather\npromising results: for two schemes, the best average accuracies were better than 90%, while for\nthe other three schemes the results were between 63% and 70%. Adding the linked/convergent\nfeature generally helped, and most dramatically for the Argument from example schema.\nIn an experiment on AIFdb data [Lawrence et al. ,2012] (which includes the Araucaria\nDB used by Feng/Hirst), Lawrence and Reed [2016] also classiﬁed the presence of a scheme,\nand in addition studied the task of identifying the scheme components (premise, conclusion)\nby means of similar features as used by Feng and Hirst. Here, the F-score results vary widely\nbetween scheme component type, and between classiﬁers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree),\nranging from 0.57–0.91. One reason for the diﬀerent performances on diﬀerent schemes is\ntheir varying connection to linguistic marking: some co-occur with particular connectives (e.g.,\nfor example ) or other expressions relatively often, while others do not.\n8.3 DETERMINING ARGUMENT QUALITY\nIn some sense, the question about the quality of an argument is the ‘ultimate’ one for argumen-\ntation mining: being able to reconstruct argumentative structures from a text is the groundwork,\nbut assessing the degree of strength of an argument, or comparing the quality of arguments to\none another, is a goal that many practical future applications will envisage. For example, an au-\ntomated debating chatbot that constantly produces lame arguments will not be successful—so\nit better be aware of the quality parameter.\nWe divide this section in three parts. The ﬁrst follows up on Chapter 3and looks at the\nproblem from a logical perspective, where the consistency of a constellation of argument com-\nponents is of interest. Then, our second part considers the quality of an argument in a more\ngeneral sense: How good is it, and, for that matter, what exactly does ‘good’ mean? Finally, the\nthird part focuses speciﬁcally on the role of emotion in argumentation, which in many practical\nscenarios can be a decisive factor for perceived quality.\n8.3.1 CONSISTENCY CHECKING\nThe step from argumentation mining in text to automated reasoning is, as of today, a very diﬃ-\ncult one, but as we pointed out earlier, we believe it to be crucial for making progress with ana-\nlyzing arguments ‘underneath the linguistic surface’. Hence, in this section, we brieﬂy consider\nthe paramount ‘quality’ question for logical reasoning: given a constellation of arguments, which\narguments are consistent with each other? Argumentation solvers address this question for for-\nmal argumentation models. Systems such as Arg&Dec, ASPARTIX, ASPIC, and Carneades\n\n--- Page 127 ---\n114 8. ASSESSING ARGUMENTATION\nwhich can reason over these formal models have been applied, typically to manually constructed\nformalisms drawn from real online debates. The underlying models vary, and many are based on\nDung’s abstract argumentation frameworks, which we introduced in Section 3.4.1, and which\ncanbesolvedfor acceptability withnumerousargumentationsolvers.Forinstance,Dung’sframe-\nworks have been extended by bipolar argumentation frameworks [ Cayrol and Lagasquie-Schiex ,\n2009], which use both attack and support relationships, represented as diﬀerent edge types, and\nwhich have also been used for consistency checking, and by abstract dialectical frameworks.\nArgumentation solvers Several existing systems, which we refer to as argumentation solvers\nand computational argumentation systems, can reason over argument frameworks. Cerutti et al.\n[2018] provide a broad review of formal systems and their implementations. Thimm and Villata\n[2017] summarize best-in-class argumentation solvers from the ﬁrst biennial competition of the\nresearch community, and provides background on the answer set programming and satisﬁability\n(SAT) solver approaches that underlie argumentation solvers.\nFor instance, Carneades [ Gordon ,2013],3an opensource reasoning system with an online\ndemo4can evaluate argument graphs, and takes multiple input and output formats. It is moti-\nvated by legal reasoning and can calculate whether an argument meets one of several common\nlegal evidence standards. It can also compute the ‘calculus of opposition’, grounded, complete,\npreferred, and stable extensions of an abstract argumentation framework.\nConnectingnaturallanguagetoargumentationsolvers NoDE(Naturallanguagearguments\nin online DEbates) [ Cabrio and Villata, 2014] is a manually annotated corpus of bipolar argu-\nmentation from three data sources: the Debatepedia5online debate platform, the script of the\ncourtroom play “Twelve Angry Men”, and Wikipedia revision histories. The corpus also con-\ntains images of bipolar argumentation frameworks, such as Figure 8.3, which was generated by\nanalyzing Act 3 of Twelve Angry Men.\nCabrio and Villata [2016] use abstract dialectical frameworks, which generalize Dun-\ngian frameworks by specifying an acceptance condition for each argument node. This enables\nabstract dialectic frameworks (ADF) to express arbitrary relationships (rather than just attacks\nas in Dungian frameworks), and in particular positive and negative weights can be used, also\nencompassing bipolar argumentation. They generalize textual entailment to groups of text frag-\nments in what they call a bipolarentailmentgraph which uses arguments as nodes and the textual\nentailmentrelationsasedges.Theygivetwoexamplesofusingtheirpipelinetogeneratecoherent\nsets of arguments starting from Debatepedia data from NoDE.\nCerutti et al. [2016] create and solve three diﬀerent formalisms based on manual anal-\nysis of an online debate from the createdebate.com forum. These are: a Dungian abstract\nargumentation framework (see Section 3.4.1), a Quantitative Argumentation Debate (QuAD)\nframework [ Baroni et al., 2015] (modeled after IBIS, see Section 3.4.1, and evaluated with the\n3https://carneades.github.io/ (accessed May 20, 2018).\n4http://carneades.fokus.fraunhofer.de/carneades/ (accessed May 20, 2018).\n5http://www.debatepedia.org (accessed May 20, 2018).\n\n--- Page 128 ---\n8.3.

Unlike the Dungian abstract argumentation\nframework, it can represent attacks on the relationships. Unlike the QuAD framework, it al-\nlows cycles (such as two arguments that attack each other). Each computational argumentation\n6http://www.arganddec.com (accessed May 20, 2018).\n\n--- Page 129 ---\n116 8. ASSESSING ARGUMENTATION\nmethod has some advantages for their case. The Dungian approach can be used to identify ac-\nceptable arguments and sets of mutually defending arguments, which “allows participants in the\ndialogue to strategically focus their attention” [ Cerutti et al. ,2016, p. 70] on those arguments\nidentiﬁed as as non-defeated. The QuAD framework represents both support and attack rela-\ntionships (though the same argument cannot be represented as simultaneously supporting one\nargument and attacking another, leading them to duplicate certain arguments). QuAD can also\nnumerically compare the strength of the arguments, given numerically assigned input on the\nintrinsic base strength, though the winning argument can change with small changes in these\nnumerical assignments.\nSimilarly, Cocarascu and Toni [2017b] manually construct a bipolar argumentation\nframework from a set of hotel reviews, and use the DF-QuAD method [Rago et al. ,2016] to\nquantify the strength of arguments. They also suggest using bipolar argumentation frameworks\nfor summarization, since conﬂicting viewpoints and their support can be seen in the graph.\nWyner et al. [2016] modiﬁes sentences from an online discussion hosted by the BBC\nHave Your Say7about who should pay tax on garbage. Rather than mining arguments, they\nenvision leveraging controlled language input and enacting a series of transformations, using\nthe automatic transformation from the controlled language ACE into ﬁrst-order logic. Their\nuse of a solver, however, is informative: ultimately, they use the ASPARTIX system to solve the\nargumentation framework. They consider policy positions, which are preferred extensions (in the\nDungian sense), either for or against the original position.\nComputational argumentation systems and solvers for a variety of formal argumentation\nframeworks are mature. There is clear potential for a pipeline from natural language argumen-\ntation to a ‘solved’ argument showing sets of coherent, non-contradictory positions. So far the\nmost successful pipeline seems to be that of Cabrio and Villata [2016], using textual entail-\nment and abstract dialectical frameworks, while there are several other promising approaches.\nAn important open question is which formalisms are most appropriate, in the senses of being\nconducive for modeling natural language, cognitively intuitive, etc.\n8.3.2 ASSESSING OR COMPARING QUALITY\nBroadening the notion of quality from the logical perspective also to infomal treatments, the\ncomplexity of the question is attested by a body of literature in argumentation theory and\nrhetoric; a comprehensive overview is presented by Wachsmuth et al. [2017b]. For orientation,\nwe mention here only the proposal of Blair[2012], who makes the term ‘quality’ more explicit\nby suggesting to decompose it into three dimensions.\n•Logical: The argument is cogent. This in turn breaks down into three criteria that an\nargument should meet:\n– Relevance: All premises of the argument indeed provide support for the conclusion.\n7http://www.bbc.com/news/have_your_say (accessed May 20, 2018).\n\n--- Page 130 ---\n8.3. DETERMINING ARGUMENT QUALITY 117\n– Acceptability: The premises are worth being believed.\n– Suﬃciency: The premises provide enough evidence for accepting the claim.\n•Rhetorical: The persuasive eﬀect or success of the argument.\n•Dialectical: The argumentation is reasonable fur the purpose of resolving an issue.\nIt is obvious that this characterization does not straightforwardly lead to a computable\ntask of determining quality, as it is rather abstract. One reason is that argumentation in text\nor dialogue can come with so many diﬀerent purposes and in diﬀerent forms, as pointed out\nbyWachsmuth et al. [2017b]: the goal may be to persuade an audience, to resolve a dispute, to\nachieve agreement, to recommend an action, and more. Depending on situation and context,\nthe categories mentioned above are of diﬀerent degrees of importance.\nStill, some initial steps have been proposed, and three possible strategies can be identiﬁed:\nfocus on one speciﬁc dimension; rephrase the problem as comparing two arguments in terms\nof (some aspect of) quality; and try to break the overall quality issue into a number of well-\nmotivated dimensions that can be addressed individually. We discuss them in turn.\nFocusononedimensionandgenre Exploitingtheannotationsinthecorpusof402persuasive\nessays [ Stab and Gurevych, 2014a], work by Stab and Gurevych [2017a] selected the suﬃciency\ncriterion (see above) and applied it to essays. The assumptions are that students have diﬀerent\nabilitiestoactuallysupporttheirarguments;andthattrainedannotatorsareabletoperceivethese\ndiﬀerences; and that these judgments are not entirely subjective. Stab and Gurevych extracted\n1,029 text portions corresponding to complete arguments (claims and premises) in a paragraph,\nwith an average length of 4.5 sentences per argument. Three annotators answered the question\nwhether an argument is ‘suﬃciently supported’, and they agreed on 91.1% of 433 arguments\n(Fleiss \u0014=0.77).\nTaking this result as indicative for the task to be solvable, the whole corpus was annotated,\nwhich lead to 681 suﬃcently supported arguments (66%) and 348 insuﬃciently supported ones\n(34%).8Turning to automatic classiﬁcation, Stab and Gurevych compared a rich-feature SVM\nwith a CNN using word embeddings [Mikolov et al., 2013]. The SVM with optimized fea-\ntures (including 4,000 most frequent unigrams, length, constituency parsing productions, fre-\nquency of named entities) achieved a macro-F1 score of 0.77, narrowly beating a SVM unigram\nbaseline of 0.75. The main problem observed by the authors was a relatively low recall on the\ninsuﬃciently-supported arguments. The CNN performed best, with a macro-F1 of 0.83.\nComparing arguments When considering the quality question in general, it does not seem\nvery practical to take an argument, outside any context of use, and ask a human being to score\nit on some scale of goodness. A more natural task is that of a choice between two (or more)\n8Guidelines and corpus are available at https://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/data/argumentation-mining (accessed\nSeptember 29, 2017).\n\n--- Page 131 ---\n118 8. ASSESSING ARGUMENTATION\narguments: which one is more convincing? Labeled data for this scenario can be elicited from\nannotators, or derived from existing data. For example, Wei et al. [2016] worked with online\ndebates. Their data comes from ChangeMyView, which is a subforum of reddit.com. Here,\nusers initiate a discussion thread by posting their thoughts toward some topic, and others reply\nwith opposing arguments, trying to change the initiator’s mind. Also, users can vote which reply\nposts they consider more persuasive, so that each reply is associated with a ‘success’ score. Wei\net al. selected 1,785 threads with 374,000 posts in total.\nGiven the post/score tuples, they trained a pair-wise ranker with three groups of features.\nIn the experiments, the surface features (length, distribution of PoS tags, URLs, punctuation)\nturned out to be not very helpful. (Unigrams and named entities had also been tried but were\neventually discarded.) The second group consisted of interaction features: the size of the reply\ntree generated by a post, and the level of the post in the overall tree (rooted in the initiating\npost). Finally, local argumentation features were computed with a binary classiﬁer that labels\nsentences as non-/argumentative, using the features proposed by Stab and Gurevych [2014b].\nThe proportion of argumentative sentences was taken as a feature, in addition to the number of\nconnectives and modal verbs. And the ﬁnal feature was the cosine similarity between the post\nand its parents, meant to estimate relevance of the post.\nInterestingly, the results diﬀered depending on the stage of the discussion. In the initial\nphase, with only a small number of posts, the argumentation features, and in particular the\nsemantic similarity, worked best. When threads are long, on the other hand, the relatively simple\ninteraction features turned out to be more predictive.\nThe variant of gathering pairwise judgments from human raters was explored by Habernal\nand Gurevych [2016]. From two debate portals (createdebate.com and procon.org), they\nchose 32 discussion topics and randomly sampled about 30 arguments per topic. These were\ncombined into 16,927 argument pairs (avoiding cross-topic pairs). Crowdsourcing was then\nemployed to judge one argument as more convincing, or both as equally good. Habernal and\nGurevych devised a method for performing quality assurance, which was based on constructing\nthe transitive closure of all the pairwise rankings in order to detect problematic claim pairs. The\nﬁnal corpus contains the subset ﬁltered in this way, but also the ‘bad’ pairs in a separate set.9\nTo automate the comparison, Habernal and Gurevych experimented with a feature-rich\nSVM and a bidirectional LSTM. The former obtained an accuracy of 78% and beat the LSTM\n(76%), but the authors point out that they did little optimization work on the NN, and that the\nfeature engineering for the SVM was quite laborious, involving, among others, parsing features,\nsentiment analysis, and NER.\nA follow-up experiment on the same dataset was reported by Chalaguine and Schulz\n[2017]. With a simple forward-feeding neural network (one hidden layer), they achieved an\naccuacy of 77%, essentially replicating the results of Habernal and Gurevych with much less\n9The annotated data is available for research: https://github.com/UKPLab/acl2016-convincing-arguments (accessed\nSeptember 28, 2017).\n\n--- Page 132 ---\n8.3. DETERMINING ARGUMENT QUALITY 119\nmachinery. The authors attribute this success to their idea of doing a precomputation step on\nthe feature values: instead of taking the values per argument ‘as is’, they computed for each value\nits relation to the average value for that feature in the entire dataset. In this way, they added\nsome limited form of context knowledge to the feature space.\nA taxonomy of quality dimensions Another new dataset resulted from the work of\nWachsmuth et al. [2017b]. The authors ﬁrst provide a comprehensive survey of earlier work\non argument quality, both from the argumentation theory and from the argumentation mining\nperspective. On the basis of that study, they propose a taxonomy of dimensions that together are\ntaken to deﬁne ‘quality’. It extends the three categories we cited at the beginning of this section.\n•Logic: Cogency (Co)\n–Local acceptability (LA)\n–Local relevance (LR)\n–Local suﬃciency (LS)\n•Rhetoric: Eﬀectiveness (Ef)\n–Clarity (Cl)\n–Credibility (Cr)\n–Appropriateness (Ap)\n–Emotional appeal (Em)\n–Arrangement (Ar)\n•Dialectic: Resonableness (Re)\n–Global acceptability (GA)\n–Global relevance (GR)\n–Global suﬃciency (GS)\nThe authors tested the taxonomy in an annotation experiment, using data from the above-\nmentioned corpus of Habernal and Gurevych [2016]. For every issue/stance pair, they took the\nﬁve top-ranked texts and selected another ﬁve texts by stratiﬁed sampling, so that arguments of\ndiﬀerent degrees of quality are included. The resulting set of 320 arguments was annotated for\nall 15 dimensions by three annotators and, overall, the agreement was found to be promising.\nFor illustration, we reproduce here (Figure 8.4) the scores given by the three annotators on two\ntexts, which responded to the question whether plastic water bottles should be banned. Anno-\ntators had to assign 1 (low), 2 (medium), or 3 (high); the bottom line represents the majority\nvote for the three annotators.\n\n--- Page 133 ---\n120 8. ASSESSING ARGUMENTATION\nFigure 8.4: Annotations of scores on argument quality dimensions [Wachsmuth et al., 2017b,\np. 184], used with permission.\n8.3.3 ARGUMENT AND EMOTION\nThe role of emotion is often a contentious issue in argumentation: when a matter-of-fact, lo-\ngos-oriented exchange is being aimed at, any appeal to emotion is seen as a ﬂaw; while in some\nsituation where the speaker intends to persuade the hearer, emotional involvement may be re-\ngarded as a legitimate rhetorical instrument, involving pathos. For a thorough discussion of these\npoints, see the work of Govier [2010], who discusses the relation between logical reasoning and\nemotion in depth.\nBesidesbeingcontentious,theroleofemotionmaybe diﬃcultto detectempirically.Inthe\nweb corpus annotation project of Habernal and Gurevych [2017] (see Section 5.3.5), annotators\nwereaskedtoalsolabelargumentsforthefeature‘appealtoemotion’,buttheagreementobtained\nwas not substantial. In contrast, Hidey et al. [2017] ran an Amazon Turk experiment to label\npremises (in claim-premise pairs of blog comments) for the logos, ethos, or pathos dimension.\nComparing the majority view of the Turkers to the gold labels, agreement in terms of \u000bwas a\nsolid0.73.Noticethat‘ethos’-typepremisesareveryrare(3%of1,068premisesintotal),though.\nAlso, delegating the emotionality annotation task to Mechanical Turk, Oraby et al. [2015]\nwere interested in the linguistic patterns that ditinguish factual from emotional arguments.\nTo obtain data, they used quote-response pairs from the Internet Argument Corpus (see Sec-\ntion4.2.1), and had them annotated by Turkers who were asked whether the respondent is\nattempting to make a fact-based argument or is appealing to feelings and emotions. This lead\nto a dataset of 3,466 ‘fact’ and 2,382 ‘feeling’ posts.\nThen, using a syntactic-pattern learner [Riloﬀ, 1996], Oraby et al. extracted characteristic\nconstructions from both sets of posts, which they regarded as high-precision, and then used to\naccumulate more patterns by means of a bootstrapping approach on un-annotated data. In the\n\n--- Page 134 ---\n8.3. DETERMINING ARGUMENT QUALITY 121\nFigure 8.5: Examples of ‘fact’ and ‘feel’ argumentation style patterns [Oraby et al., 2015, p. 121],\nused with permission.\nend, they tested the pattern sets and determined an accuracy of 80%. (Figure 8.5shows some\nexamples for extracted patterns.) However, while precision was good, the recall was signiﬁcantly\nlower than that obtained by a supervised unigram baseline.\nA study involving the same fact/emotion-annotated data, but aiming at quite ambitious\nresearch questions, was reported by Lukin et al. [2017]. Their goal is to quantify the extent\nto which readers’ beliefs can change due to being confronted with diﬀerent types of argument\n(factual vs. emotional, inter alia ), and how this depends on personality traits. The experiments\nwere all done via Amazon Turk. In a preparatory step, Lukin et al. assessed the personality of\ntheir Turkers by means of a survey that tries to measure standard traits: openness to experience,\nconscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.\nNext,forcomparingtheinﬂuenceoffactualvs.emotionalarguments,theauthorsgathered\nexamples from the above-mentioned IAC data, which were reliably annotated on the extreme\nends of the fact—emotion scale. Examples are shown in Figure 8.6.\n\n--- Page 135 ---\n122 8. ASSESSING ARGUMENTATION\nFigure 8.6: Examples of factual and emotional exchanges in the Internet Argument Corpus\n[Lukin et al. ,2017, p. 745], used with permission.\nIn addition, for comparing the diﬀerence between dialogic and monologic argumentation,\ntext for the latter was sampled from procon.org, which contains expert-curated summaries of\narguments on contentious topics.\nThe core experiment then followed the before/after reading paradigm, involving three\nsteps.\n1. Turkers are being asked a stance question to determine their prior beliefs on a socio-\npolitical issue, such as “Should the death penalty be allowed?”\n2. Turkers are being shown an argument from one of the three categories monological, emo-\ntional, factual.\n3. Turkers are being retested with the original stance questions.\n\n--- Page 136 ---\n8.3. DETERMINING ARGUMENT QUALITY 123\nWhen measuring the stance diﬀerences, Lukin et al. found signiﬁcant belief changes for all\nthree argument types, but with certain nuances: As they had expected, the opinion change is\ngreater for those Turkers who are initially more neutral about a topic, than for those who are\nentrenched in their beliefs. Regarding personality, a ﬁnding was that ‘conscientious’ Turkers\nare more convinced by dialogic emotional arguments, whereas ‘agreeable’ Turkers are more per-\nsuaded by dialogic factual arguments.\nThen, Lukin et al. went a step further and looked into predicting belief change. Turkers\nnow were asked to rate arguments for strength, and the authors then identiﬁed the combination\nof features that best predicted argument strength. The main ﬁnding was that, for all three types\nof arguments (neutral monologic / factual dialogic / emotional dialogic), feature sets containing\nall ﬁve personality traits perform signiﬁcantly better than sets without those traits. The authors\nhave made their argument+personality data set available for research.10\nIt seems clear that the relationship between argumentation and emotion will be an active\narea for future work. As a ﬁnal example, we wish to point to another study that ventures to leave\nthe core territory of NLP and argumentation mining. Benlamine et al. [2015] presented the ﬁrst\nexperiment that explicitly assesses the correspondence between the polarity of arguments in an\nexchange and the emotions felt by participants. Their emotional status was analyzed by webcams\nand face reading software on the one hand, and physiological sensors (EEG) on the other;\nboth types of information were combined into scores reﬂecting the status of basic emotions\n(neutral, happy, sad, angry, surprised, scared and disgusted). The participants were engaged in\ndebates on topics that were likely to stir people’s temper, for instance ‘Religion does more harm\nthan good’. The debates were recorded and in a post-processing session mapped to an argument\ngraph, so that support/attack relations could be anchored to points in time, and then correlated\nwith the emotional states of the participants. The authors of the study indeed detected some\ncorrespondences between emotions and argumentative moves, e.g., when two opposite opinions\nwere expressed, this was reﬂected in a negative way on the debaters’ emotions.\n10https://nlds.soe.ucsc.edu/persuasion_persona (accessed October 1, 2017).\n\n--- Page 137 ---\n125\nC H A P T E R 9\nGenerating Argumentative\nText\nStrictly speaking, the generation (or synthesis ) of argumentative text is outside the scope of min-\ning, but nonetheless we consider the topic here, as it is a part of the wider ﬁeld of argumentation\ntechnology and will be increasingly relevant for many applications. However, in contrast to anal-\nysis, the generation of arguments has so far received much less attention. In the following, we\ndiscuss the topic along the lines of the two established techniques of text production: a system\ncan generate from symbolic representations of knowledge or from data (Section 9.1), or it can\nmap existing text to new (or revised) text (Section 9.2).\n9.1 GENERATING TEXT FROM STRUCTURED DATA\nEarly work in automatic text generation was concerned with building systems that were able to\nproduce short texts from a collection of structured data or from knowledge that was represented\nin a suitable formalism, such as Description Logic or Bayesian belief networks. The latter were\nemployed by Zukerman et al. [2000], who showed how the logical structure of an argument can\nbe systematically constructed by combining knowledge of a small set of argument schemes with\na model of hearer beliefs, which the argument should try to inﬂuence. In complete generation\nsystems, the path from plain data to a well-formed text is long, and it was commonly divided\ninto three phases [Reiter and Dale, 2000].\n1.Textplanning: given a set of communicativegoals, the system ﬁrst selects the content units\n(data instances, knowledge chunks) that are to be expressed in the text, and then organizes\nthem into a text plan, which speciﬁes hierarchical relations between content units, and\ndetermines the linear order in which they will appear in the text. The text plan is totally\nagnostic of the target natural language that will eventually be produced.\n2.Micro-planning orsentence planning: the text plan is traversed and mapped onto a se-\nquence of sentenceplans. This involves distributing the series of content units into a certain\nnumber of sentences. Furthermore, each sentence plan now gets linguistic (and language-\nspeciﬁc)information,suchastheintendedembeddingofcomplexsentences.Animportant\ntask islexicalchoice : deciding which words to use for expressing a content unit (or a part of\nit; or several content units).\n\n--- Page 138 ---\n126 9. GENERATING ARGUMENTATIVE TEXT\n3.Realization: each sentence plan is converted to a well-formed sentence in natural lan-\nguage, on the basis of grammatical knowledge: words are properly inﬂected, and appro-\npriate function words (such as determiners or prepositions) are inserted in the right places.\nCommunicative\nGoals\nCommunicativ e\nStrategiesDomain Knowlege\nSources:\n • User Model\n • Domain Model\n • Dialogue History\nLinguistic Knowlege\nSources:\n • Lexicon\n • GrammarText\nPlan\nEnglishText\nPlanner\nText\nMicro-planner\nSentence\nRealizerContent Selection\nand Organization\n(deep generation )\nContent Realization\n(surface generation )\nFigure 9.1: Pipeline architecture of typical text generation systems [Carenini, 2001, p. 2], used\nwith permission.\nA diagram outlining this architecture is shown in Figure 9.1. Notice that the knowledge\nsources include general domain knowledge (which entities occur, what their attributes are, how\nthey are related), a history of the discourse produced so far (be it dialogue or monologue), and\nimportantly a user model . Especially when part of a dialogue system, text generation has been\nconceived as a process whose output is geared toward a particular user, and the system normally\nhas information about this user, so that the text can be speciﬁcally tailored to her or his needs.\nIn the following, we will make this architecture more concrete by explaining three systems that\ninstantiated the model for producing short monologue text of an argumentative nature, followed\nby one system aimed at conducting a dialogue with a user. Each one works in a particular do-\nmain, and in the absence of reusable or generic knowledge sources, the work of building such a\ngeneration system involved a lot of hand-crafting: designing domain knowledge representations,\nlinking them to the lexical knowledge of the target language, etc.\n\n--- Page 139 ---\n9.1. GENERATING TEXT FROM STRUCTURED DATA 127\nADVISOR II This early text generator by Elhadad [1995] produced short texts simulating\na student advisor, with the central issue being to recommend classes that are suitable for the\nstudent. Thus, the domain knowledge records all the courses oﬀered along with a number of\nattributes such as content, prerequisites, diﬃculty level, and the like. The user model speciﬁes\nwhat courses the student has already taken, what her interests are, etc. Three possible commu-\nnicative goals can be posed as input to the system: inform the student about a course, recommend\ntaking a certain course, or recommend not taking it. The latter two involve giving reasons, and\nhence a form of argumentation. Here is a sample output [Elhadad, 1995, p. 192].\nAI deals with many interesting topics, such as NLP, Vision and KR. But it has many\nassignments which consist of writing papers. You have little experience writing pa-\npers. So it could be diﬃcult. I would not recommend it.\nThe content in the ﬁrst sentence was selected by comparing the knowledge base (KB) and the\nuser model (UM). The evaluation interesting is not a fact, i.e., an attribute of the course in the\nKB, but is produced by the system after determining that the topics covered by AI include many\nthat the user enjoys. The comparison also reveals that the user has not produced many written\nassignments yet (according to the UM), while assignments are necessary to pass AI (KB). This\nleads ADVISOR to connect the descriptive second sentence to the ﬁrst by the conjunction but:\nthis signals a shift in argumentative orientation, which is appropriate here, since the ﬁrst sen-\ntence amounts to a positive evaluation of the course (for the user), while the second is negative.\nSimilarly, the predicate diﬃcult is not an attribute of the course per se, but computed by the sys-\ntem on the grounds of comparing the weights of positive and negative evaluations of the course.1\nThe argumentation-theoretic underpinning of Elhadad’s system is the notion of topoias\nadvanced by Anscombre and Ducrot [1983]. A topos is a gradual inference rule of the form\n“the more/less X is P, the more/less Y is Q”, and one possible instantiation in the domain of\nADVISOR is “the more diﬃcult a class is, the less a student wants to take it”. Topoi serve to\nconnect the course knowledge base and user model on the one hand, and the linguistic decisions\nof the system on the other—they trigger the use of evaluative adjectives or of connectives (like\nbutin our example above). But verbs, too, can be chosen on the basis of the argumentative\norientation that is to be conveyed. One of Elhadad’s examples is the following.\n(9.1) You enjoyed AI.\nYou took AI.\nYou struggled with AI.\nAllthreeverbsexpressthatthestudenthasattendedtheAIclass,but enjoyandstuggleinaddition\nconvey evaluative connotations. The lexicon used by ADVISOR is aware of such diﬀerences and\ncan choose among similar word on principled grounds.\n1This overall setting has many parallels to contemporary product recommender systems.\n\n--- Page 140 ---\n128 9. GENERATING ARGUMENTATIVE TEXT\nGEA The idea of the Generator of Evaluative Arguments (GEA) [ Carenini, 2001] is similar\nto that of ADVISOR. Again, the input to the system is a communicative goal to inﬂuence the\nuser’s attitude toward some entity. The sample domain implemented by Carenini was real estate,\nand thus the goal is to get a user to like or dislike a particular house. In analogy to ADVISOR,\nthe KB holds the information about a set of houses, and the UM represents the user’s prefer-\nences. Its format is quite elaborate, though: a tree structure that decomposes a domain concept\n(here: house) into its attributes, and associates importance values to them, which characterize\nthe extent to which the user is keen on an attribute. A house thus is characterized by size, lo-\ncation, price, etc., which may in turn be decomposed further. The preference values indicate\nwhether the user likes a quiet or a buzzlng location, whether a target size of ﬁve rooms is very\nimportant or only mildly important, and so forth.\nOn the basis of this information in the UM GEA computes how valuable a particular\nhouse is for the user, and how valuable the diﬀerent attributes are. In this way, it also identi-\nﬁes which attributes can be used as evidence for parent attributes in producing an appropriate\nargument pro or contra a house.\nFigure 9.2: Sample text plan produced by the GEA system [Carenini, 2001, p. 8], used with\npermission.\nGEA’s text planner implements several argumentation strategies that specify how to order\npositive and negative points. Strategies are coded as operators that decompose abstract goals into\nsimple, concrete ones. For illustration, Figure 9.2shows a sample text plan. The chosen strategy\n(see the top of the tree) is to ﬁrst assert the overall evaluation computed for the house—user\n\n--- Page 141 ---\n9.1. GENERATING TEXT FROM STRUCTURED DATA 129\nmatch, then to provide the main argument in favor (decided via the preference values in the\nUM), and then the remaining positive observations. Decomposition stops at the grey boxes,\nwhich correspond to speech acts involving an attribute and its value.\nSimilar to ADVISOR, the microplanning module of GEA is then in charge of converting\nthe speech act objects into linguistic predicate/argument structures; this mapping uses a lexicon,\nand the choices among near-synonyms are made on the basis of the values associated with at-\ntributes. Likewise, connectives are chosen to indicate a continuing or changing argumentative\norientation. Here is a sample output produced by the system for a particular user (as represented\nby the UM) [Carenini, 2001, p. 8].\nHouse 2-33 is an interesting house. In fact, it has a reasonable location in the safe\nEastendneighborhood.Eventhoughthetraﬃcisintenseon2ndstreet,house2-33is\nreasonably close to work. And also it oﬀers an easy access to the shops. Furthermore,\nthe quality of house 2-33 is good. House 2-33 oﬀers an excellent view. And also it\nlooks beautiful.\nGenIE: The domain of the Genetics Information Expression Assistant [Green et al. ,2011] is\nthe production of genetic counseling letters, which explain the inheritance of recessive genetic\ndisorders to patients. The system was designed after a phase of carefully analyzing authentic\ntexts of this genre, discerning their structure and their use of argumentative moves.\nIn GenIE, the text plan is a tree structure along the lines of Rhetorical Structure Theory\n(RST) [Mann and Thompson ,1988], which we brieﬂy introduced in Section 2.6.2. Many text\nplanning modules developed in the 1990’s and 2000’s made this choice, because RST relations\nare deﬁned in such a way that they can in principle also be operationalized used as planning\noperators.2In this use in text generation, an RST tree does not have natural language sentences\nat its leaf nodes, but semantic representations of content-to-be-verbalized. Hence, the text at\nthe leafs in the sample text plan in Figure 9.3, while looking like English, is in fact a shorthand\nfor a formal representation.\nGenIE builds the text plan by means of hand-crafted discourse grammar, which encodes\nthe structural regularities found in the corpus of counseling letters. Argumentation is added in\na post-processing step: the RST plan is screened for material that needs more motivation for\nthe patients, and a separate argument generation module then builds a small RST tree that is\ninserted into the overall text plan.\nThe argument generator uses argumentation schemes (as introduced in Section 3.3), for\ninstance an eﬀect-to-cause scheme and an increased-risk scheme. Green et al. started from the\nscheme catalogue of Walton et al. [2008] but found that for their speciﬁc purposes, they needed\nto formulate more speciﬁc versions of certain schemes.\n2However, Reed and Long [1998] pointed out that in order to thoroughly distinguish common inference ﬁgures such as\nmodus ponens and modus tollens, a more abstract layer of information—besides RST—is needed in text planning, and they\nsuggest a possible formalization of corresponding planning operators.\n\n--- Page 142 ---\n130 9. GENERATING ARGUMENTATIVE TEXT\nFigure 9.3: Sample text plan produced by the GenIE system [ Green et al., 2011, p. 36], used\nwith permission.\nThe GenIE system has been evaluated with an editing task: College students with genetics\nbackground were given either a human-authored letter or a computer-generated letter and asked\nto make it more understandable to non-specialist readers (i.e., the intended target audience of\nthe letters). It turned out that while the computer-generated letter required more edits, fewer\nadditions of extra material were needed.\nDaphne The Daphne system [Grasso et al. ,2000] embeds the generation of arguments into\nthe architecture of a dialogue system that aims to convince users to eat more healthy food. The\nunderlying approach to argumentation is the schema-based ‘New Rhetoric’ theory of Perelman\nand Olbrechts-Tyteca [1969] (cf. Section 3.4.1). A knowledge base encodes information on\nwhat kinds of food have positive or negative eﬀects on health, and a dynamic network mod-\nels diﬀerent perspectives and values associated with topics, as they can develop in a dialogue.\nDaphne has a component for reasoning about the user’s beliefs, and the text and sentence plan-\nner (which are part of an entire dialogue management system) employ the results for trying to\nselect and formulate arguments that will have a persuasive eﬀect on the user. The system archi-\ntecture is designed in such a way that domain-speciﬁc knowledge and argumentation-speciﬁc\n(strategic, rhetorical) knowledge are kept largely separate from one another, so that the latter\ncould in fact be employed for other domains as well.\n\n--- Page 143 ---\n9.2. GENERATING TEXT FROM TEXT 131\nTowardpresentingformalargumentationtousers Finally, we brieﬂy turn toward formal ar-\ngumentation. Cerutti et al. [2017] explored the idea of constructing a “natural language inter-\nface” to formal argumentation systems. Given a representation in an argument network or an\nabstract argumentation framework (cf. Section 3.4), the goal is to map it to English text, such\nthat users can more easily grasp the contents of the representation. Hence, the authors consider\nfour communicative goals.\n• Present a single argument or an approximate argument.\n• Present an entire argument network.\n• Explain the acceptability status of a single argument or an approximate argument.\n• Explain the extensions, given some semantics.\nA user model is not accounted for, so presenting and explaining arguments here are not tailored\nto a particular user (or user group). The authors provide a blueprint for how the classical text\ngeneration pipeline model can be instantiated to produce such verbal descriptions, using a text\nplanner based on RST relations that are relevant for this domain, in particular Evidence, Justify,\nand Antithesis.\n9.2 GENERATING TEXT FROM TEXT\nAs we indicated in the previous section, the approaches to text generation mentioned there in-\nvolve a lot of manual work, because (except for grammatical realization) up to now there are only\nvery few re-usable or standardized components for the generation process. And even if represen-\ntations of knowledge are designed carefully to avoid hard-wiring domain speciﬁc information,\nthe actual knowledge acquisition process has to be re-started whenever a new domain is being\ntackled. The alternative to this laborious process is to combine argument mining with argument\nsynthesis: ﬁnd textual material that can be rewritten into new text. To make this feasible, the\noriginal text usually is taken not in its raw form, but annotated with linguistic information that\nsupports the re-combining steps.\nLegalarguments Anearlyproposalalongtheselineswasmadeby AshleyandWalker [2013b],\nwho describe a partial implementation with a vision of where the work could be taken. The\napproach occupies the middle ground between our two sections, as it involves quite ‘deep’ an-\nnotations. The idea is to generate legal arguments by re-combining parts of related arguments\nthat have been made in similar cases. The underlying data is a corpus of 35 legal decisions on\nvaccine injuries, where each decision consists of 15–40 pages of text. These have been manually\nannotated with two types of information: (i) domain-speciﬁc semantic relations between en-\ntities, covering, inter alia , causal chains; and (ii) the complex propositional inference structure\nunderlying the decision, using a default logic notation. The authors evisage this information be-\ning used in conjunction with more basic automatic annotations of syntactic dependencies and\n\n--- Page 144 ---\n132 9. GENERATING ARGUMENTATIVE TEXT\ncase-semantic relations, so that a retrieval engine could ﬁnd components of arguments that are\nrelevant to a new case and can be used to produce cogent arguments.\nWide-coverageparagraphgeneration Less ‘deep’ in annotation but fully implemented is the\ntext production system presented by Sato et al. [2015]. Here, the user can enter a topic in the\nform of a motion sentence ( This house should do X ) and a stance toward that motion, and the\nsystem generates three argumentative paragraphs, each relating to a particular aspect of the mo-\ntion.\nFigure 9.4: Excerpt from the ‘value dictionary’ used in the argument generator by Sato et al.\n[2015, p. 113], used with permission.\nThe paragraphs are produced by selecting (and partly modifying) sentences from\n10,000,000 news texts of the Gigaword corpus; hence, the system is not restricted to a few\ndomains only. Manual work is restricted to creating various lexicons of epistemic verbs, evalua-\ntive modiﬁers, etc. The text corpus is stored in a database and annotated with automatic syntax\nparses plus instances of the lexical relations that are speciﬁed in the resources. The processing\npipeline works as follows.\n1.Analyzethemotion: The sentence entered by the user—for example, Thishouseshouldban\ngamblinginthecity —is divided into a ﬁxed number of components: a keyphrase capturing\nthe motion topic, the predicate used in the topic, polarity, etc.\n2.Aspect selection: For the generator, the potentially interesting aspects of the motion are\nthose that trigger evaluative judgment in the audience; the authors hence call these aspects\n‘values’. The system retrieves sentences that contain lexical aﬀect-relations between the\nmotionkeyphraseandaphrasefoundinthevaluedictionary(seetheexcerptinFigure 9.4).\nThe sentence “Gambling increases the number of crimes”, for example, is a good candidate\nbecause increase is a verb of the semantic class aﬀect, and crimeis commonly evaluated as\nnegative. The system tries to make sure that the polarity of the retrieved sentences matches\nthat of the desired argumentation and selects sentence groups for ﬁve aspects/values.\n3.Sentenceretrieval: A full-text search is executed on the corpus, using a query that is being\nbuilt from the motion and value phrases. Among the sentences retrieved, the system ﬁlters\nfor the right polarity (so that an argumentatively-coherent text will result) and it prefers\nsentences that contain promote/suppress relationships.\n\n--- Page 145 ---\n9.2. GENERATING TEXT FROM TEXT 133\n4.Sentenceordering,rephrasing: To build a paragraph, sentences are arranged according to\nan ordering scheme suggesting that the text starts with a claim sentence and is followed by\nsupport sentences. To determine claims, a binary classiﬁer is run on the sentences (this is\nthe task we discussed in Chapter 5). The supporting statements are ordered by maximizing\nthe connectivity between sentences, as suggested by Tan et al. [2013]. Finally, a certain\namount of rephrasing is done: details such as dates or proper names are being eliminated\nfrom the sentences.\nTo evaluate the approach, texts were generated for 50 motions from debatabase.org. Human\njudges ranked the paragraphs (consisting of seven sentences each) on a scale from 0 (makes no\nsense) to 4 (sounds natural). Of the 150 sentences, 86 received label 0, indicating that—probably\nnot surprsing—the overall problem is quite diﬃcult. The three major problems identiﬁed in error\nanalysis were polarity computation, analysis of diﬃcult motion sentences entered by the user,\nand erroneous sentence retrieval due to lexical ambiguity etc.\nRhetorics in re-generation Considering the diﬃculties in producing acceptable text by re-\ncombining sentences found ‘in the wild’, some researchers suggested to pay more attention to\nrhetorics when making selection and ordering decisions. Beyond the patterns of ordering that\nhavebeen used in earlier work (and which wereusually taken from guides to good writing), Aris-\ntotle’s means of persuasion (logos, ethos, pathos ; see Section 1.1.2) have already received some (if\nnot much) attention in argument analysis; Duthie et al. [2016], for instance, presented a study\non ﬁnding ethos in political debates. For the generation task, Wachsmuth et al. [2018] suggest\nthat the three means also need to be accounted for when recombining sentences into a new text.\nThey sketch a model for selecting and ordering sentences, which takes in particular the distinc-\ntion between logos- and pathos-oriented argumentation into account. To gather evidence for\nthe importance of this factor, they conducted an experiment with 26 human ‘authors’ who had to\nrecombine ADUs from a subset of the argumentative microtext corpus (see Section 4.2.2). Ten\ntopics were selected, each of which was addressed by 4-9 short texts from the corpus. Claims and\nother units (i.e., supporting and opposing statements) were put into topic-speciﬁc pools, where\nthe authors could draw from. For this to work, the ADUs need to be as context-independent\nas possible, and the authors applied two operations: removing connectives, and replacing pro-\nnouns by their antecedents. Authors were instructed to build both logos- and pathos-oriented\npersuasive texts, using these instructions.\n•Logos-oriented: Argue based on logical reasoning, which means to make rational and\nlogical conclusions toward the intended stance on the given topic.\n•Pathos-oriented: Argue based on emotional reasoning, which means to appeal to the\nemotions of the reader regarding the topic within your arguments.\nTheADUsinthepoolhadnoinformationonlogosorpathosattached,soauthorshadtoidentify\nit themselves in the sentences. The study found that for selecting ADUs from the pool, the agree-\n\n--- Page 146 ---\n134 9. GENERATING ARGUMENTATIVE TEXT\nment between authors is signiﬁcantly higher within the logos-oriented and the pathos-oriented\ntexts, which indicates that authors (and hence also readers) can indeed sense the distinction. For\narranging the ADUs in the text, three favorite ordering patterns emerged (the most popular one:\nclaim - opp. - supp. - supp. - supp.), but no diﬀerence between logos and pathos texts clould be\nobserved.\nOpen-domain claim generation An interesting step toward open-domain argument gener-\nation was reported by Bilu and Slonim [2016]. These authors sought to minimize the role of\nhuman intervention, and therefore reduced the problem to one subtask: claim generation. The\nbasic idea is to produce new claims by “recycling” linguistic predicates found in the claims of\nother arguments, which Bilu and Slonim illustrate with the example: given the claim banning\nviolentvideogamesisaviolationoffreespeech for the topic banningviolentvideogames, one might\ntransfer this to the topic internetcensorship and generate the claim internetcensorshipisaviolation\nof free speech . Thus, a key task for this approach is to learn the contexts allowing or disallowing a\ncandidate re-combination. The proposed claim generation algorithm works in three steps.\n1.Preprocessing:buildpredicatelexicon(PL) Givenasetofmanuallydetectedclaimsfrom\nthe work of Aharoni et al. [2014] (see Section 5.3.4), extract from each claim the verb and\na concatenation of its right-modiﬁers, which together form the predicate p. It is added to\nthe PL if it contains at least one sentiment word (to select predicates with a clear stance\ntoward their topic). In this way, 1,203 PL entries are produced.\n2.ClaimGeneration: givenatopic t,thepredicates pinthePLaresortedfortheirsimilarity\nwith t, using a measure involving word embeddings. For the top kpredicates, construct\na claim candidate by setting the predicate to pand the subject to the topic t. (See the\nvideo-game example above.) This may require morphological adjustments (esp. for singu-\nlar/plural matching), which are done with the ‘SimpleNLG’ sentence realization compo-\nnent [Gatt and Reiter ,2009].\n3.Claim Selection: a logistic regression classiﬁer ranks the candidate claims for their ap-\npropriateness. It uses three types of features for capturing:\n• predicates pthat seem inherently amenable to generating claims: They state some-\nthing fairly general about their subject, and they are not very speciﬁc to the topic of\ntheir original sentence (by computing similarity);\n• predicates pthat seem relevant for the target topic; this is computed as similarity\nbetween pand the topic’s n-gram lexicon. This resource in turn is built by measuring\nfrequencies of occurrence in topic-related and unrelated Wikipedia articles. Identi-\nfying topic-related articles is a manual step in the overall procedure (and had been\ndone in the earlier work reported in Section 5.3.4); and\n• claim sentences that seem to be linguistically acceptable and plausible, which is de-\ntermined via frequencies of its words and n-grams in Wikipedia.\n\n--- Page 147 ---\n9.3. SUMMARY 135\nIn an experiment for testing the system, it generated claims for 67 topics, which were extracted\nfrom motions on debatabase (at idebate.org). For all topics, previously annotated relevant\nWikipedia articles were already available. The system produced 28 candidate claims per topic,\nand they were presented to crowdworkers via Amazon Turk. Given a debatabase motion and\n10 candidate claims, an annotator had to decide which claims are appropriate for the motion.\nEvaluating this approach is not straightforward, but the authors report that the claim selection\nclassiﬁer achieved an accuracy of 0.75.\n9.3 SUMMARY\nThe strength of the more traditional domain-speciﬁc, handcrafted work discussed in the ﬁrst\nsection was that it had to implement the complete process (text planning, microplanning, real-\nization) as well as the required lexical and knowledge resources for systematically mapping an\nabstract speciﬁcation of communicative goals to a short text in natural language. In doing so, it\nthoroughly attended to the inﬂuence of argumentative aims on the diﬀerent stages of a text pro-\nduction process. The corresponding weakness, obviously, is that this type of work does not easily\ngeneralize to other domains, and that many of the fundamental questions on reusable linguistic\nand non-linguistic knowledge bases from the last century are still open. Therefore, as sketched in\nthe second section, the turn to robust methods for re-producing argumentative text from pieces\nthat have previously been found by automatic mining makes a lot of sense. For such approaches\nto work across several domains—or even in an open-domain setting—it seems that the robust\nautomatic annotation of potential argument components is key: in order to build a good text\nfrom segments, we need to know something about the segments. Attributes exploited so far\ninclude topic aspects, stance/polarity, and means of persuasion (logos, ethos, pathos). As there\nis only early work along these lines so far, with very few running implementations, this list is\nlikely to be revised and reﬁned, on the way to producing readable and pragmatically appropriate\nargumentative text from segments that were found out there ‘in the wild’.\n\n--- Page 148 ---\n137\nC H A P T E R 10\nSummary and Perspectives\nWe conclude our survey of argumentation mining with four ﬁnal steps. First, we provide a sum-\nmary of the core tasks presented in Chapters 5,6, and7, formulated as a procedure for designing\na task-speciﬁc annotation scheme of the desired level of complexity. Then, in Section 10.2we\nobserve that automatically ﬁnding arguments in text or dialogue is not an end in itself per se,\nand thus we brieﬂy consider some follow-up tasks (e.g., visualization, summarization) that may\nbe applied to the collected arguments in order to make use of them. Next, Section 10.3turns\nto the applied side and summarizes a number of downstream applications—most of which have\nbeen mentioned already in previous chapters, but here they are collected. Notice that this is not\nintended as comprehensive survey; we merely provide some indicative pointers to the literature\nas food for thought. We close with a short outlook in Section 10.4.\n10.1 ARGUMENTATION MINING: A COMMON KERNEL\nWork on argumentation mining revolves around a fairly well-deﬁned common target—the\nargument—but then quickly spreads into several diﬀerent directions. This is because argumen-\ntation occurs in very diﬀerent situations of language use, and with a variety of diﬀerent purposes.\nTherefore, the common target does not easily translate into a common set of well-deﬁned sub-\ntasksandmethodsforsolvingthem.Instead,dependingonthepurpose,diﬀerentsetsofsubtasks\ncan become relevant.\nNonetheless, taking the gist of the exposition in Chapters 5–7, we now propose a common\nkernel of a procedure for deﬁning the argumentation mining task, focusing here on monologue\ntext. The procedure can serve as a guideline or orientation in developing some initial idea for an\nargumentation mining application into a more speciﬁc project outline or an algorithm.\nHow to design an argumentation mining algorithm.\n1. Weassumethatwehaveamonologuetext Tthatweknowisargumentative(eitherbecause\nwe have found out—see Section 5.1—or because we know beforehand, for example on the\nbasis of its genre).\n2.Tincludes a minimum of two argumentative discourse units (ADUs) of at least two dif-\nferent types (see step 3). Each ADU is a contiguous span of text: depending on task for-\nmulation, it may be restricted to be a sentence, or it can be a smaller or larger unit. ADUs\ndo not overlap with each other. Tmay consist of just a sequence of ADUs, or of a mix\n\n--- Page 149 ---\n138 10. SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES\nof ADUs and non-argumentative text spans. Note that deﬁning what content is required\nfor a text span to be an ADU is to some extent also task-dependent (we have suggested a\nfairly general deﬁnition on page 63).\n3. The set of ADU typesconsists of claimand evidence, and possibly more, depending on\nthe task.\n4.Ifthetaskwarrantstheassumptionthatthereisonlyoneclaiminthetext,andifnofurther\ntypes of ADU are required, thenthe basic problem speciﬁcation is complete: Find the\nclaimADU and all evidence ADUs in T. Implicitly, a support relation holds between\neach evidence ADU and the claim ADU. Go to step 8.\nOtherwise, continue with step 5.\n5.Ifthe task suggests that there may be several claims, and associated evidence ADUs, then\nan explicit support relation needs to be established. support is a total and surjective\nmapping from evidence ADUs to claim ADUs. It may be decided that one item of\nevidence shall not support more than one claim; in this case, the mapping is injective.\n6.Ifthe task suggests that certain ADUs can function simultaneously as claim and evi-\ndence (i.e., they are supporting something else, and they receive support), thenlikewise\nthe support relation needs to be established. In this case it is a transitive relation (allow-\ning for ‘serial support’; cf. Figure 3.1). One may also introduce a separate ADU type, but\nthis is redundant, as the double-faced ADUs can be identiﬁed via outgoing and incoming\nrelations.\n7.Ifthe task suggests that the ‘opposing view’ need not be accounted for in analyzing T,\nthengo to step 8.\nOtherwise, depending on the task, diﬀerent levels of complexity are possible.\n• In the simplest case, when there is only a single claim and a number of evidence\nunits (cf. step 4), it suﬃces to introduce an additional ADU type (e.g., oppose),\nbecause any oppose unit will implicitly attack the unique claim.\n• If the analysis allows for multiple claims in T, or if an oppose segment may be in-\nvolved in a sub-structure (see below), a new relation type (typically: attack) needs\nto be added. Sub-structure arises when:\n–an oppose segment may be in support relation to another oppose segment,\nand/or\n–an oppose segment may be countered by the proponent, either by a single move,\nor recursively by a sub-structure. In this case, attack relations may hold between\nan oppose ADUanda claim/evidence unit,orviceversa.Thatis,itisnecessary\nto make both the types and the relations explicit in the representation.\n\n--- Page 150 ---\n10.2. AFTER MINING: WHAT TO DO WITH ARGUMENTS 139\n8.Ifthetasksuggeststhatsub-typesof claim, evidence, or oppose shouldbeintroduced,\nthenthat can be done.\nLikewise, ifsub-relations of support, attack are necessary, thenthey can be added.\n(For attack, a customary distinction is that between rebut and undercut.)\n9. The result of establishing a set of relations on the set of ADUs in the text (either implicitly,\nas in step 4, or explicitly) is a representation of the argumentation structure of the text.\nDepending on the number of claims present and on the properties of the relations, it is\neither a tree, or a forest, or a (single-rooted or multi-rooted) graph, whose root node(s) are\nof type claim.\n10.2 AFTER MINING: WHAT TO DO WITH ARGUMENTS\nVisualization In a way, visualization was at the very beginning of the computational work\non argumentation: The mapping tools discussed in Section 3.6help people to arrange their\nthoughts, or organize the web of contributions made in a dialogue involving two or more parties.\nLikewise, it seems natural to apply those techniques to arguments that have been gathered and\nanalyzed by automatic mining techniques—both as a means of qualitative error analysis for the\nmining techniques, and to provide input to human analysts or debaters. Some current research is\nlooking into building graphs from arguments or from stances (e.g., Toledo-Ronen et al. [2016]),\nwhich may also lead to visual presentation in one way or another. Also, Sanchan et al. [2017]\nsuggest to build charts that show the ﬂow of topics, and their intensity, in a debate. El-Assady\net al.[2016] apply various visualization techniques to debate protocols, too, emphasizing the\nutility of such an approach for studying political deliberation processes.\nSummarization Another technique that may be needed once argumentation mining works in\npractice at a larger scale is textual summarization. Assuming that a set of arguments has been\nfound for a topic, and it has been analyzed, the next step is to compute relations between those\narguments, so as to identify identical, similar, and diﬀerent arguments. For a good summary,\nthe diﬀerent aspects (or ‘facets’) raised by the variety of arguments would need to be identiﬁed.\nThis is not yet an area of much active research, but as one initial step, a dataset from the Internet\nArgument Corpus (see Sections 4.2.1and7.1.1) has been extended with human-written sum-\nmaries, and ﬁrst results on argument facet similarity were reported by Misra et al. [2015, 2017].1\nSimilarly, Boltužić and Šnajder [2016] explored the task of computing argument similarity by\nclustering techniques. Egan et al. [2016] outline an approach to summarizing the key issues\nbrought up in political debates, and some researchers have applied standard text summarization\ntechniques to online debates, extracting sentences that are topic-central and exhibit sentiment\n[Ranade et al., 2013]. Finally, Saint-Dizier [2018] proposes to use tools and techniques from\nlexical semantics (in particular, the ‘Generative Lexicon’ approach of Pustejovsky [1986]) for\nproducing summaries of argumentation.\n1The summary corpus is available for research: https://nlds.soe.ucsc.edu/node/30 (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 151 ---\n140 10. SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES\nEvaluation Finally, argument mining also needs to address the important task of evaluation,\nwhich has been discussed in the discussion of argument quality assessments in Section 8.3. In\nparticular, inconsistent lines of arguing can be determined through solving for acceptability in\nargumentation frameworks, implemented by a large number of argumentation solvers such as\nArg&Dec, ASPARTIX, ASPIC, and Carneades. Whereas currently, consistency calculations\nassume manually-built arguments or controlled natural language (e.g., Wyner et al. [2016]),\nmined arguments can be directly evaluated, when mapped to a suitable representation. In the\nstate-of-the art approach, Cabrio and Villata [2016] calculate argument acceptance conditions\nautomaticallyfromaDebatepediadebateusingaweightedabstractdialecticalframework,which\nhas been automatically induced from textual entailment.\nBesideslogicalconsistency,weintroducedinSection 8.3someinitialworkondetermining\nother dimensionsof quality and the degree of convincingness of arguments. First sets of annotated\ndata have been made available, and some results on automatic classiﬁcation have already been\nobtained. Still, this line of research is certainly still in its infancy.\n10.3 SOME APPLICATIONS OF ARGUMENTATION\nMINING\nSupportingsensemaking Sensemaking refers to making sense of larger or disparate amounts\nof information to construct narratives or explanations, as an individual or as a group. Tools for\nsensemaking support human reasoning, for instance by ﬂagging inconsistencies or visualizing or\nsummarizing information. For example, Dispute Finder highlights disputed claims on the web\nto support skeptical readers [Ennals et al. ,2010]. Among numerous collaborative sensemaking\nplatforms, Videolyzer provides a collaborative platform for assessing the veracity of claims in\nonline political videos [Diakopoulos et al., 2009]; CommentSpace [Willett et al., 2011] helps\nteams gather evidence and organize comments on visualizations and websites. Schneider [2014]\nsuggests argumentation mining could be used to support open source and open knowledge\nprojectsinsensemakinganddecision-making.Groupdecision-makingoftendependsonﬁnding\nand comparing rationales for claims, and may start with a sensemaking process. For instance, vi-\nsualization and representation of diﬃcult conversations is key in dialogue mapping, an approach\nto meeting facilitation that uses argument mapping software [ Conklin, 2006]. Argumentation\nmining could help extract and organize claims and arguments to support visualization, summa-\nrization, synthesis, or evaluation components in such applications.\nPractical reasoning Practical reasoning refers to deciding on a practical course of action. It\nhas been extensively studied in the argumentation community; as just one pointer we mention\nWalton’s book on the subject [ Walton, 2015]. Argument maps are commonly used to help make\na debate accessible. In a computer program called Virgil, for instance, Ball[1994] applied Toul-\nmin’s model to analyze public policy. More recently, Renton and Macintosh [2007] presented\nmaps of the Scottish Parliament’s debate and policymaking on banning smoking in public places\n\n--- Page 152 ---\n10.3. SOME APPLICATIONS OF ARGUMENTATION MINING 141\nthat provide a ‘policy memory’. Systems for supporting public discourse on topics of public con-\ncern, such as ConsiderIt2[Kriplean et al. ,2012], have developed visualizations and analytics.\nArgumentation mining could reduce the manual work in creating support systems for practical\nreasoning.\nArgumentRetrieval Retrieving arguments from text collections corresponds to the core tasks\nof ﬁnding claims and evidence, as discussed in Chapters 5and6. For many purposes, these steps\nalso constitute a complete application. In the science domain, for instance, being able to ﬁnd the\nmain new points in collections of papers would be extremely helpful. This is the aim of Rastegar-\nMojarad et al. [2016], who crawl PubMed abstracts and aim at detecting evidence statements,\nwhich are then mapped to a formal language (‘Biological expression language’). Similarly, in\nthe legal domain the retrieval of arguments made in support of a particular decision is of great\ninterest. An overview is provided by Ashley and Walker [2013a].\nTaking the retrieval task from speciﬁc domains and text collection out into the web\npresents a set of technical challenges for large-scale processing, as surveyed by Wachsmuth et al.\n[2017c]. One particular and very important subtask is to determine the appropriateness or rel-\nevance of a candidate argument for a speciﬁc search query. Wachsmuth et al. [2017d] suggest\nbuilding a graph of arguments found in a document collection, and then applying a variant of the\nPageRank algorithm for ranking these arguments according to relevance. Those authors show\nthat this approach outperforms various other candidate ranking methods. A benchmark dataset\nis made available.3\nSupportingWeb-ScaleDiscourseandDebate Theuseofwebdataforargumentationmining\nhas been mentioned many times in this book, and we have pointed to a number of corpora that\nhave been drawn from online debate forums, as to provide training and test data for mining\ntechniques.Fromadiﬀerentviewpoint,thegoalofactively supporting theexchangeofarguments\non the web constitutes another promising application of argumentation mining. This starts with\nproviding technical frameworks for managing discussions, and including argument detection\ncapabilities, as for instance suggested by Cabrio et al. [2013b]. A related task is that of providing\nactive support to human debaters by suggesting suitable arguments to them. Rosenfeld and\nKraus[2015] conducted large-scale empirical studies on what arguments people select under\nparticular circumstance, and on this basis designed a Predictive and Relevance-based Heuristic\nagent. Taking this a step further to actual debating technology requires an interplay of many\ncomponents (of which the core argumentation mining functionality is but one), as the overview\nbyLawrence et al. [2017a] explains.\nSentiment analysis Connections between argumentation and sentiment analysis have been\nexplored by many researchers, especially in the context of product reviews. For example, Wyner\net al.[2012] studied the role of sentiment words and discourse relations for the analysis of cam-\n2https://consider.it (accessed May 28, 2018).\n3http://argumentation.bplaced.net/arguana/data (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 153 ---\n142 10. SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES\nera reviews, and suggest an argumentation scheme for representing the underlying structure.\nWachsmuth et al. [2015] predict the global sentiment of product reviews from the ﬂowof sen-\ntiment, which is modeled as a sequence of sentence sentiment scores. The authors propose a\nmethod for comparing such sequences to each other and demonstrate its utility for three diﬀer-\nent review domains. They suggest thinking of sentiment ﬂow as a key aspect of the argumen-\ntation structure underlying the review. Finally, we mention Liu et al. [2017], who found that\nmanually-annotated argumentative moves (claim, premise, background, recommendation, etc.)\ncan signiﬁcantly improve the prediction of review helpfulness of hotel reviews.\nWriting Support Providing students with qualitative feedback on their writing starts with\nthe word processor complaining about grammatical errors or stylistic infelicities. But it can go\nmuch further, and also include aspects of good argumentation. In the previous chapters, we have\nreferred to work on student essays several times; recall the idea of checking whether arguments\nare suﬃciently supported [ Stab and Gurevych, 2017a], or whether critical questions of argument\nschemes are attended to by the writers [ Song et al. ,2014]. The latter approach is elaborated in\nmore detail from the perspective of education research by Nussbaum and Edwards [2011]. For a\nbroader survey of (pre-argumentation-mining) computational tools that can support teaching of\nargumentation, see Scheuer et al. [2010]. And an online demo of the ArgRewritePITTRevision\nWriting Assistant shows how argumentative aspects are part of the feedback to the student.4\nEssay Scoring Closely related to writing support, automatic essay scoring is an application\nthat in general needs to consider a wide range of linguistic parameters, but for the speciﬁc class\nof argumentative essays, techniques from argumentation mining have proven to be helpful. For\ninstance, Ong et al. [2014] developed a rule-based approach to ﬁrst label the sentences of an es-\nsay with a functional tag: Claim, Supports, Opposes, Citation, Hypothesis, and Current Study.5\nThen, another rule set maps the distribution of labels to a number of points corresponding to\na grade. This relatively simple approach was found to yield acceptable results for comparative\nranking (but not for grading). In contrast, a rich feature set for classiﬁcation was employed\nbyPersing and Ng [2015], which included semantic frames, coreference, predictions of agree-\nment with the prompt, classiﬁed argument components, and more. On a corpus of 1,000 essays\nfrom the International Corpus of Learner English, Persing and Ng [2015] showed that their\nsystem, after feature optimization, signiﬁcantly outperforms the results of Ong et al.\nSong et al. [2014], who exploited the critical questions of argumentation schemes (see\nSection 8.2.2) concluded that their results can contribute “additional useful information about\nessay quality to a strong baseline essay scoring model”, which is Educational Testing Service’s\nE-Rater system. Argumentative features improved on another strong baseline, the open source\nEnhanced AI Scoring Engine, in Nguyen and Litman [2018]’s experiments, particularly when\ntest and training sets responded to diﬀerent writing prompts.\n4http://argrewrite.cs.pitt.edu/ (accessed May 28, 2018).\n5This resembles the ‘argumentative zoning’ of Teufel and Moens [2002], see p. 24.\n\n--- Page 154 ---\n10.4. OUTLOOK 143\nWachsmuth et al. [2016] provide a comparative analysis of a broad range of features (in-\ncluding assessments of linear order, as discussed in Section 7.2.2) in terms of four diﬀerent\naspects of essay scoring: organization, thesis clarity, prompt adherence, and argument strength.\nA strong feature is the distribution of argument components across the paragraphs of an essay.\nSimilarly, Ghosh et al. [2016] manually annotated TOEFL essays and showed that knowledge\nabout argument components and, more importantly, argumentative relations can contribute to\npredicting essay scores.\nDialoguesystems One long-term perspective is the automatic dialogue system, possibly built\nupon chatbot technology, that will be able to give advice (on how to act, on what to buy, and so\non) and provide reasons for that advice. And ideally, it will be able to not only answer a user’s\nquestion but also discern their arguments and respond to them intelligently. Such systems can\nbe bootstrapped by ﬁrst ‘harvesting’ arguments, counterarguments, and audience values from\npeople, as Chalaguine et al. [2018] investigate for health-related behavior change. ‘Persuasive\ndialogue’ is a very active research area, which we have only touched upon in this book, when\ndescribing the Amazon Turk study by Lukin et al. [2017]. More connections between dialogue\nresearch and argumentation mining will most certainly be built, to textual dialogue but also to\nspeech—a topic that we have excluded completely in this book. For a start, the work by Lippi\nand Torroni [2016b] can be considered, which reports on experiments on detecting claims in\noral political debate, incorporating speech features. In terms of language resources, a new audio\nand textual dataset for debate research has recently been created by recording 60 speeches on\ncontroversial topics by professional debaters [Mirkin et al., 2018].6\n10.4 OUTLOOK\nLike any technology, argumentation mining has a potential to beneﬁt society as well as to be\nturned to harmful uses. In sentiment analysis, for instance, work on analyzing and generating\nreviews has in recent years certainly increased the need for ﬁnding fake reviews. The potential\nimpact of argumentation mining seems to us even larger, with its potential to integrate rationales\nas well as emotions. The ubiquity of argumentation makes it particularly powerful. Being able to\nquickly digest arguments in text, summarize them, and create a debating system would enable\nautomated arguing systems to inﬂuence humans, whether in chatbots or in dialogue systems.\nAutomated agents that can argue persuasively may be seen as beneﬁcial when they convince us\nto exercise more, but harmful when used for marketing. Such agents might outreason humans,\nas chess systems do, yet interact in a home-like environment, such as current smartphone as-\nsistants and home automation systems do. When arguing with humans, there is little recourse\nagainst opponents who argue without conviction—playing devil’s advocate—or who artiﬁcially\nstrengthen a position (as the Greek sophists were criticized for making the weaker argument\n6The recorded debating dataset is available for research: https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/debating\n_data.shtml (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 155 ---\n144 10. SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVES\nappear the stronger argument). Researchers must be alert to such risks. Communities consid-\nering ethics7can provide guidance, and we encourage the reader to attend to comprehensive\nand thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible\nrisks.8\nWhile it may seem a little irritating that this new research ﬁeld is not really quite settled\nyet, the positive side is that there are so many things still waiting to be done: argumentation\noccurs in everyday conversation between couples and in families, in the workplace, and of course\neverywhere in the media. There are the more regulated formats such as parliamentary debates,\nlawmakingandjurisprudence;thedecidedly-informalclaimsmadeviaTwitteroritscousins;and\ntheintermediate formof thestudent’sessay.All these—andmore—invitedigestion,sorting,and\nfurther availability for in-depth studies on how argumentation works, when it is successful or\npersuasive, and when it has ﬂaws. The more reliable the automatic tools that support this, the\nbigger the picture that can be drawn.\nAs we remarked earlier, we believe that at some point, further progress will depend on the\nconnection between language processing and automated reasoning (which in turn will require\nhelp from computational semantics). While there is little work on building bridges between\nthesecommunitiessofar,supplementinganautomaticallyconstructedrepresentationofthekind\ndiscussed in Chapters 5–7, with robust systems that can evaluate statements against background\nknowledge, and perform consistency checks, can open up a great many new doors.\n7Such as the Ethics in NLP workshop series: http://www.ethicsinnlp.org (accessed May 28, 2018).\n8See the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-\nand-professional-conduct (accessed May 28, 2018).\n\n--- Page 156 ---\n145\nBibliography\nRob Abbott, Marilyn Walker, Pranav Anand, Jean E.

He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Toronto in\n1996 with a thesis on language generation; in those years he studied discourse structure primarily\nfor its role in text generation. After working for ﬁve years in a machine translation project at TU\nBerlin, he moved to Potsdam in 2001, where his interests shifted to text analysis. He conducted\nresearch projects on applications like information extraction and text summarization, and on\nmore theoretical matters like the semantics and pragmatics of connectives. In conjunction with\nresearch on discourse parsing, he began to work on argumentation in the 2000s, focusing ﬁrst\non newspaper editorials. Following the design of an annotation scheme, he proceeded to work\non approaches to deriving argumentation structure trees from short texts, and on various other\naspects of argumentation mining.\nJODI SCHNEIDER\nJodi Schneider is an assistant professor in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s\nSchool of Information Sciences. She has held research positions across the United States as well\nas in Ireland, England, France, and Chile. She earned her Ph.D. in informatics (National Uni-\nversity of Ireland, Galway), two Master’s degrees in library & information science (UIUC) and in\nmathematics (UT-Austin), and a Bachelor’s degree (Great Books, St. John’s College, Annapo-\nlis, MD). She has authored over 30 research publications on topics in argumentation, artiﬁcial\nintelligence, biomedical informatics, and computer-supported collaborative work. Her research\nuses arguments, evidence, and persuasion as a lens to study scholarly communication and social\nmedia. She also develops and evaluates tools to manage scientiﬁc evidence from the biomedical\nliterature with an NIH-funded project, Text Mining Pipeline to Accelerate Systematic Reviews\nin Evidence-Based Medicine.\n\n--- Page 183 ---\n173\nIndex\nAbstract argumentation, 114,116\nADVISOR II, 127\nArgument\nCategories, 3\nComponent, 27\nConvergent, 28\nDeﬁnition, 1\nDivergent, 28\nFallacy, 8\nLinked, 28\nArgument comparison, 118\nArgument consistency, 113\nArgument diagram, 27,39,42\nTools,41,42\nArgument Interchange Format (AIF), 42,43\nArgument map, 36,39–41\nArgument model, 31\nCohen, 35\nDung Frameworks, 34,35\nIBIS,35\nThe New Rhetoric, 33\nToulmin, 33,48\nArgument quality, 113,117,119,140\nArgument retrieval, 9,141\nArgument summarization, 9,139\nArgument synthesis, 125\nArgument visualization, 139\nArgumentation\nAnnotation, 45–51\nMining (deﬁnition), 6normative, 4\nStructure, 6\nArgumentation scheme, 30,109,112,113\nArgumentum model of topics, 31,32,\n110\nArgumentation solver, 114,116\nArgumentation strategy, 105\nArgumentation structure\nHierarchical, 100,102–104\nSequential, 104\nArgumentative Discourse Unit, 6,62,63\nDeﬁnition, 63\nArgumentative zoning, 25,66\nArgumentativity classiﬁcation, 7,58–62\nAristotle, 1,5\nAttack, 85\nRebut, 6,86\nUndercut, 6,86\nAutomatic reasoning, 8\nClaim, 27\ngeneration, 134\nidentiﬁcation, 66\nConnective, 20,80\nCorpus\nABCD, 52\nAIFdb, 113\nAraucaria, 53,60,66,110\nArgum.

The 5th edition of Learning Legal Skills and Reasoning draws on a range of areas of law to show how these key skills can be learnt and mastered, bridging the gap between substantive legal subjects and the skills required to become a successful law student. \nThe book is split into four sections: \n  Sources of law: Including domestic, European and international law. \n  Working with the law: Featuring advice on how to fnd and understand the most appropriate legislation and cases. \n  Applying your research:  How to construct a legal argument, answer a problem \nquestion and present orally (mooting). \n  Skills for solving disputes:  From negotiation to mediation and beyond. \nPacked full of practical examples and diagrams to illustrate each legal skill, this new edition has been fully updated and now includes a new chapter on drafting. It will be an essential companion for any student wishing to acquire the legal skills necessary to become a successful law student. \nTobias Kliem is the Head of Arden University’s Berlin Campus.

This new and revised 16-chapter text is designed to consolidate the magnif -\nicent work that was started by Sharon Hanson in 1999 with publication of the book’s frst \nedition. More than 20 years later the 5th edition of this valuable legal skills text continues to adopt the well-known user-friendly and practical approach of the previous editions of Learning Legal Skills and Reasoning , by consolidating the material into 16 chapters which \nare divided into four discrete parts: ‘Sources of law’, ‘Working with the law’, ‘Applying your research’ and ‘Skills for resolving disputes’. Whilst some of the previous chapters have merged, many have been retained, and there is one new chapter: Drafting skills, which can be found in \nPart 4. \nThe book continues to refect the need for new law undergraduates to grasp a broad \nrange of skills, and our commitment as authors and editors of the latest edition has been to deliver these in one manageable text retaining the important substance of that which has gone before together with additions. The book resumes its objective of entering into dialogue with the reader, explaining how to understand and apply the full range of legal and academic skills required by law students. It addresses basic issues of concern for many students as well as more sophisticated skills relating to arguing, reading the law and those used for resolving disputes. The book is deliberately written in an accessible style which will ensure that students new to the study of law are not overawed as they embark upon their journey through legal education or by the demands of studying a chal -\nlenging academic discipline. \nThe study of law requires students to acquire a range of new and sometimes chal -\nlenging skills. The narrative of this practical manual aims to engage the reader in a highly personalised conversation, at times presuming to voice their worst fears, ‘What if I am not good enough?’, ‘What if I cannot understand?’, ‘What if I fail something?’ The book helps students to confront these uncertainties, and throughout the book context is provided for the reader, which engages the student in dialogue about the matters under consideration. The authors and editors retain Dr Hanson’s belief in the importance of diagrams to dem -\nonstrate interconnections that are not apparent simply from reading or hearing narrative. As she would have wished, they remain one of the particular characteristics of this text introduced by her, as well as the range of exercises and activities with suggested answers to test skills’ development, together with glossaries of troublesome terms. \n\n--- Page 31 ---\n XXX PREFACE \nAs Sharon said in the preface to the 4th edition, this book would not have been pos -\nsible without the incredible support she received from her then-editor Fiona Briden and \nher assistant Emily Wells. As editors of this 5th edition, we would like to thank the support and guidance of the current editorial team at Routledge, particularly Emily Kindleysides and latterly Chloe James and Russell George. We are indebted to you all and the rest of the team. We would also like to thank Brian Hanson for the support provided for making the 5th edition possible. \nFinally, we join Brian in paying tribute to Sharon, our former colleague, who died in \n2016. Sharon’s faith, commitment and support for colleagues was inspirational. Her work as an academic and educator always placed her at the heart of students’ learning, where she was able to understand the needs and requirements of students of law during the learning process. As founding director of a charity advising government and other policy -\nmakers regarding issues of religion in society, she worked tirelessly to improve people’s lives both in the UK and abroad. Sharon was widely published in the area of law and religion; however, it is her work in relation to legal method that stands out as a bea -\ncon of authoritative discipline excellence, and her legacy will always be Legal Skills and Reasoning , which now lives on in its 5th edition. \n\n--- Page 32 ---\n \n \n INTRODUCTION \nAs with previous editions, careful thought has gone into the structure of this book. It can \nbe approached in an order to suit the reader. As a whole it is designed to enable the law student to gain skills vital to the academic stage of legal education. \nThis is a method and skills book, and it is therefore no substitute for texts in your sub -\nstantive areas of study such as criminal law, the law of contract or the English legal sys -\ntem. The book draws on a range of areas of law to demonstrate skills development and to alert you to some of the confusions and mistakes easily made. It is a book that bridges the gap between substantive legal subjects and the skills that need to be acquired in relation to: \nStudy skills How to develop independent and highly effcient learning \nstrategies \nIT skills How to engage with email, word processing, virtual learning environments, internet searches, e-library use, database manipulation \nLanguage skills How to competently understand and use ordinary English and legal English terminology \nCritical thinking skills How to develop the ability to constantly question, seeking the underlying assumptions behind arguments, taking nothing for granted, seeking evidence for your assertions, questioning your own positions \nLegal research skills How to fnd law and texts about law through highly effective library skills \nLegal method skills How to approach and handle legal rules \nArgumentation skills How to identify, construct and evaluate arguments \nReading skills How to read legal rules, judges’ opinions, academic critiques of law reports etc. \nWriting skills How to write notes, summaries, essays, legal problem solutions, exams, reports etc. and draft documents \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-101\n \n\n--- Page 33 ---\n \n 2 INTRODUCTION  \nSpeaking (oral) \nskills How to engage in debating, mock trials (mooting), mediation, negotiation, presentation \nPreparing for Assessments How to effectively prepare for and produce written and oral assessments \nSuccessful legal study depends upon the simultaneous development of different, but \ncomplementary, skills. For example, knowing how to study, understand the sources of law, and where to fnd the law; how to analyse and critique the law, how to construct legal arguments and how to successfully engage in written and oral assessments. All of these issues are covered in this book which is divided into four parts. \nPart 1: \nSources of law \nPart 2: Writing the law \nPart 3: Applying your research Part 4: Skills for resolving disputes \nT\nhroughout the book you will note that the primary focus is inevitably text based. It deals \nwith texts of law (statutes, case law, treaties) and texts about law (textbooks, academic \narticles). This distinction between texts of law and texts about  law is important to grasp. \nTexts of law set out the primary legal rules, while texts about law look at law from a \nrange of perspectives, questioning and critiquing or just summarising the state of law. These are called secondary texts because they are basically commentaries about the legal rules in the texts of law. \nAs you gain competency in legal study and legal skills you will increase your critical \nability to analyse law; this will sharpen your thinking, you will learn to ask questions, never taking anything for granted, looking for evidence to support arguments. \nYou may have found the above listing of the parts of the book daunting as it sets out \nthe range of skills that you need to develop. However, it is better to be informed about the complex interconnectedness of your studies from the start. Too often, students are not clearly informed at the beginning of their studies of the full extent of the skills required. They then wonder why they are not progressing, but it may be that while they will be good at the study of law eventually they initially need to develop skills of library usage, research, IT and personal time management. \nBe warned, however: it is easy to forget the range of skills you need to work on, once \nyou become too busy coping with information overload, the facts of cases, the words making up a legal rule, a defnition, the translation of a Latin phrase used in law, etc. You may think you cannot waste time trying to understand as well! Frequently, memorising becomes a comfortable tranquilliser protecting the student from the productive pain of fghting with incomprehension to reach a place of partial understanding. Sadly, within the discipline of law, successful memorising often merely ensures failure as the student knows it all and yet understands nothing. \n\n--- Page 34 ---\n  \n \n INTRODUCTION 3 \nThe acquisition of knowledge without the ability to understand it and apply it is not \nstudying it; it is just mindless rote learning. The easy  part is acquiring knowledge – the \ndiffcult  part of studying is understanding what you know and applying it. You would not \npay to be advised by a lawyer who knew everything but understood nothing. \nThe majority of books on the market that deal with issues of legal skills and legal \nmethod (that is, the way in which legal rules are used to resolve certain types of disputes) \ndo so in the context of legal process or legal theory. Inevitably, many of these books tend to be weighted in favour of explaining the English legal system, its processes, personnel and doctrines. They do not give time to an appreciation of how to engage with standard academic skills, how to break into texts, to read them and to understand them and how to construct arguments. This book recognises that in order to be successful in your legal studies you need to get inside legal rules, and fully appreciate their various dimensions. \nThis text acknowledges the complexities of legal rules, the importance of critique and \nthe construction of legal arguments, and the need to develop excellent general academic skills, including study skills. But it also assists students, in a user-friendly manner, to make interrelationships within and between texts. It presents language clearly, and uses these interrelationships to allow the commencement of the task of understanding and reading the law, of seeing arguments, evaluating arguments and in turn assisting you to construct arguments. \nLaw is dynamic, not passive. Reading is dynamic, not passive, as you will fnd out – it \nhas to be as you need to enter into ‘conversation’ with what you are reading. Studying is also dynamic, not passive. Learning does not happen to you; it is something that you do. \nEssentially, therefore, this is a book about practical matters, practical skills of stud -\nying, IT strategies, practical thinking and the acquisition of a range of practical legal, research, intellectual and presentational skills and, as such, relies on reader refection and activity. But these practical matters are underpinned by \nPart 1, which sets out, in four \nchapters, the sources of law. Its practical nature means that it relies on your willingness to engage actively with the book. But its practicality is consistently aimed at developing critical thinking and allowing you to develop a complex understanding so that you can engage in highly competent analysis. \nT\nhe original author’s objective in writing this book was to provide a usable manual for \nlaw students new to the discipline and this approach has been adopted by the current authors and editors: the text therefore, draws a map of your studies, it sets out the terri -\ntory and also provides smaller maps to enable you to locate and understand legal texts and to reach a place of understanding where you can recall relevant memorised knowl -\nedge concerning general or specifc contexts and apply it, or interpret it confdently with a clear comprehension of the interrelationships between rules, arguments and language, in the search for plausible solutions to real or imaginary problems. \nThis text is not a philosophical enquiry that asks why English law prefers the methods \nof reasoning it has adopted. Although such texts are of the utmost importance, they will mean more to the student who has frst acquired a thorough competency in a narrow feld of practical legal method and practical reason. Then, a philosophical argument will be \n\n--- Page 35 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  4 INTRODUCTION  \nappreciated, considered, evaluated and either accepted or rejected. This is not a theoret -\nical text designed to discuss in detail the importance of a range of legal doctrines such as precedent, although you must also carefully study these. Further, this is not a book that critiques itself or engages in a post-modern reminder that what we know and see is only a chosen, constructed fragment of what may be the truth. Although self-critique is a valid enterprise, a fragmentary understanding of ‘the whole’ is all that can ever be grasped. \nIntellectual understanding brings with it the ability to realise that we can only ever see \npart of the whole collection of stories that is the law. Therefore we should approach the study of law carefully, checking that our arguments and our criticisms are plausible. We need to constantly check that the arguments and criticisms of others are also plausible. Knowledge is essential but it is equally essential to think of the use of our knowledge in terms of it being a torch shining in the dark. There is a strong central beam of light that enables you to see well. But that beam of light fades through shadows to darkness and although we cannot see it we know that there is more ‘out there’. Study is the same: there is always more we cannot see, and never will see. This should protect us from \nFigure 0.1 The function of this ‘how to’ text \n\n--- Page 36 ---\n  \n \n          INTRODUCTION 5 \nmaking assertions about the whole of law, for we cannot see it all. We do not understand \nit all. \nThis is above all a ‘how-to’ text, a practical manual. As such, bearing in mind the list of \nskills set out above that are necessary for legal studies it concerns itself primarily with the use of 12 areas identifed in Figure 0 .1. Carefully read the list as it constitutes your march -\ning orders for the rest of the book and for your legal study. \nThe parts and chapters in this book can stand alone, or be used selectively to form \na pathway for a particular need of study. For example, if you wished only to study about domestic legislation you can look at: \nPart 1: \nSources of law \n\n Chapter 1: Domestic  legislation \nP\nart 2: Working with the law \n\n Chapter 6 : Finding material \n Chapter 7: Reading  and understanding legislation \nP\nart 3: Applying your research contains fve chapters that concentrate on the deployment \nof a range of skills to engage in the fnished products of writing differing types of course -\nw\nork, engaging in oral skills and writing examinations. \nThe book will also draw attention to the fact that there is often more than one solution \nto a legal problem. Judges make choices when attempting to apply the law. The study of \nlaw is about critiquing the choices not made as well as the choices made. \nThe text as a whole will introduce you to the value of alternatives to purely textual \nexplanations. An ability to comprehend diagrammatic explanations will be encouraged. The diagrams used are integral to the successful understanding of legal skills, legal method, legal reasoning and general academic skills as presented in this text. \nThey have been specifcally designed to: \n  provide a way of taking students to deeper levels of understanding; \n  give a basic description or blueprint for an area; \n  demonstrate interconnections between seemingly disconnected areas/texts/skills. \nDiagrams present another way of seeing, and the sheer novelty value of seeing the inter -\nconnections in a diagram can sometimes be enough to change confusion into compre -\nhension. It is hoped that students will begin to construct diagrams for themselves. \n\n--- Page 38 ---\n PART 1 \nSOURCES OF LAW \nA clear understanding of the different types of legal rule is a basic prerequisite for the \ncompetent exercise of legal skills and reasoning. The four chapters in Part 1 are designed \nt\no map the territory of law. They identify its sources, describe its creation, format and the \nlimits of its jurisdiction. \nCh\napter 1 ‘Domestic legislation’ defnes and explains what legislation is, how it is \ncreated by Parliament and the formats used to set it out. The chapter also distinguishes between primary legislation (created by Parliament) and secondary legislation (created by offce holders and groups on the delegated authority of Parliament). Time is also taken to explain the range of interchangeable words/phrases used when referring to legislation which can be confusing. \nChapter 2 ‘Domestic case law’ gives you a basic appreciation of what common law \nor case law is, and the way in which it is created, developed, discussed and changed by the senior judges in the English courts. It describes the hierarchical structure of English courts and tribunals as well as their jurisdiction, staffng and development of the key doc -\ntrine of precedent by the senior judiciary. Precedent is discussed in detail in Chapter 8 . \nThe importance of three courts outside the hierarchy of the courts is also considered: the Privy Council, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights. \nChapter 3 ‘International and European Law’ is designed to introduce the basic con -\ncept of treaties (formal agreements between nations) and discusses how they are cre -\nated, amended or terminated. It also considers the legal impact of treaties that have been entered into by the government, drawing distinctions between international law and English law. Time is taken to ensure the vocabulary used in treaties and about treaties is understood. The chapter also considers European Law, a source of law originating out -\nside the English legal system in the founding treaties of the European Union (EU). These no longer have legal effect inside the English legal system due to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. But as the UK and countries within the EU continue to be trade partners, this law remains relevant. EU law includes the treaties, legislation and the case law of the European Union and each area is discussed in this chapter. \nChapter 4 ‘Human rights’ looks at the European Convention on Human Rights, explain -\ning its relationship to domestic human rights law. Human rights law is an increasingly important area of law globally. It is a key issue in political debate and has given rise to \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-1  \n\n--- Page 39 ---\n      SOURCES OF LAW 88 SOURCES OF LAW \nmany controversies in the UK concerning judicial interpretations of both the European \nConvention on Human Rights (ECHR) 1951 created by the Council of Europe and the English Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA). Students of English law are often quite justly confused about the relationship between the ECHR and the HRA. The chapter explains in detail how the English legal system’s human rights law originates outside the English legal system in European treaties. It also explains how parts of the ECHR have been given limited legal effect in the English legal system by the HRA. The chapter includes concen -\ntration on selected articles\n1 of the ECHR and its protocols, as well as selected decisions \nof the European Court of Human Rights.\n1 A t reaty is subdivided into numbered articles.\n\n--- Page 40 ---\n1 \n  \n DOMESTIC \nLEGISLATION \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Understand the structure and role of Parliament in the enactment of domestic \nlegislation. \n  Appreciate the role of government in proposing legislation. \n  Be aware of the procedures that must be followed to create valid legislation. \n  Understand the process of drafting legislation. \n  Distinguish between primary and secondary legislation and be aware of its standard formats and subject matter. \n  Be aware of the function of statutory interpretation. \n  Understand the basic relationship between cases and legislation. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-2  \n\n--- Page 41 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   10 DOMESTIC LEGISLATION  \nINTRODUCTION \nDomestic legislation is created by Parliament or by the delegated authority of \nParliament and it is the major source of legal rules in the English legal system. English legislation is referred to as ‘domestic’ to differentiate it from European Union (EU) legislation enacted by the institutions of the EU. Up until the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, EU legislation was a major source of English law, but this is discussed in Chapter 3 . \nPrimary and secondary domestic legislation are described and the standard method \nof creating them is set out. The standard layout of domestic legislation is also dealt with. A brief explanation of statutory interpretation by the judiciary is given; however, detailed discussion of this area is reserved for Chapter 7 , which concentrates on the skills of read -\ning, analysing and interpreting legislation. \nWHAT IS DOMESTIC LEGISLATION? \nDomestic legislation is the dominant form of law making in the English legal system and it is created by the authority of Parliament. It exists in two main forms, primary and sec -\nondary legislation. Primary legislation (statutes) applies to the whole of the English legal system and is created by Parliament directly. It can deal with any subject matter that Parliament wishes. \nSecondary legislation (delegated legislation) is created by others acting on powers \ndelegated to them in primary legislation, which in these circumstances can be described as ‘enabling’ or ‘parent’ legislation. For example, an individual minister of state may be given powers to make changes to certain primary legislation. Or a professional body may be allowed to make legal rules affecting its members. A local council\n1 can enact legal \nrules applicable only to the geographic area of the council. Secondary legislation is often described as an indirect form of law making and can be additionally referred to as del -\negated or subordinate legislation. It can be repealed or changed by primary legislation. \nTwining and Miers describe legislation as encompassing a wide variety of rules in \n‘fxed verbal form’.\n2 \nLegislation is enacted in various timescales. Sometimes legislation is quickly created \nas a reaction by Parliament to a crisis or public outcry or a one-off situation, for exam -\nple, in response to an act of terrorism (an often-cited example is the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991).\n3 Sometimes it is a reasonably well-considered response to a particular issue \nsuch as consumer protection. On other occasions it is the end product of several years of public, political and expert consultation. The Equality Act 2010\n4 (EA) is an example of \nlegislation that was the outcome of several years of consultation. \nLegislation can be enacted to create new codifed legal rules on any matter. It can also be \nenacted to consolidate existing law in a particular area, such as theft. In that case, it brings \n1 T echnically referred to as a local authority (LA). \n2 W Twining and D Miers, How to Do Things with Rules (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2010), 193. \n3 c . 65 1991. \n4 c . 15 2010. \n\n--- Page 42 ---\n   \n \n \n \n   DOMESTIC LEGISLATION 11 \ntogether rules made by judges as part of the common law,5 customary legal rules6 and/or \nexisting legislation into one statute; it does not change the existing law but clarifes it. \nNot all codifying legislation gets it right. A good example is the Theft Act 1968. It codi -\nfed the common law and prior legislation in existence in the area of theft. However, a \nmajor problem with the old law was the defnition of deception. The Theft Act 1968 failed to deal with this adequately and eventually the Theft Act 1978 was enacted to resolve the problem. That too proved inadequate in a range of areas and it was followed nearly 20 years later by the Theft (Amendment Act) 1996. Continuing issues around fraud and deception fnally led to the Fraud Act 2006.\n7 \nAlthough legislation responds to particular issues, the fner details of the situations to \nwhich the rules will have to be applied will vary enormously. Primary legislation is there -\nfore drafted in a general way, in order to be applicable to the widest possible range of situations. This often presents a major challenge to those drafting the legislation and to those who are subsequently called upon to interpret it. \nNaming conventions for legislation \nAn Act of Parliament or statute starts life as a ‘bill’ usually drafted by parliamentary coun -\nsel who are lawyers skilled at drafting proposed laws. A bill can change dramatically as it goes through the processes of enactment, which means that if the bill becomes a statute it should not be consulted for the purposes of interpreting the law. However, it can be an interesting historical record of what was left in and what was taken out of the legislation during the processes leading to enactment. \nThere are several phrases used to refer to primary and secondary legislation, and \nthese are set out in Figures  1.1 and 1.2. \nSecondary legislation, like primary legislation, is covered by a range of synonyms, and \ncan also be of several different types. Figure 1 .2 sets out the main synonyms and types \nof secondary legislation. \nThe statute book \nWhen considering legislation in other texts you will no doubt hear the phrase ‘the stat -\nute book’. This is a reference to all the enacted legislation in the English legal system arranged chronologically. Each statute in any year is a chapter in the statute book. The Wild Animals in Circuses Act 2019 has the full citation The Wild Animals in Circuses Act 2019 c.24, with the lowercase ‘c’ being an abbreviation for ‘chapter’. From this we know it is the 24th statute enacted in 2019; it is Chapter 24 of the statute book for 2019. \nFinding legislation \nLegislation can be found in many places: in handwritten collections,8 print collections \nand online collections held by libraries or institutions such as Parliament or the Courts. \n5 E xplained in Chapter 2 . \n6 Ibid. \n7 c . 35 2006. \n8 T here are surviving parchment rolls of handwritten legislation dating from about 1299. \n\n--- Page 43 ---\n \n    \n   \n \n    \n \n \n \n  12 DOMESTIC LEGISLATION  \n1. SYNONYMS USED FOR GENERAL REFERENCE TO PRIMARY LEGISLATION: \nA synonym is another word  or phrase meaning the same thing \n• An Act of Parliament \n• An Act • A legislative act • A statute (which means decree) \nPRIMARY LEGISLATION GIVING DELEGATED POWERS TO  \nLEGISLATE CAN BE REFERRED TO AS \nThe parent Act or the enabling Act \n2. DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRIMARY LEGISLATION \nThere are also different types of primary legislation that need to be distinguished from each \nother \n• A Public General Act • A private Act • A private member’s Act • A hybrid Act • Orders in Council \nSINGULAR AND PLURAL FORMS FOR PRIMARY LEGISLATION \nStudents can be confused by plurals in this area; hopefully the following will help: \n• The word ‘legislation’ is understood in the plural sense. • If you want to refer to the singular you need to think in terms of a ‘piece’ of legislation. But the \nappropriate term would be legislative act. \n• More commonly a singular re ference is made to ‘an Act’, or ‘the Act’ or to the statute. The \nplural is denoted by the addition of an ‘s’ to the relevant noun and changing the pronoun \ne.g. ‘The Acts considered together provide’, or ‘these statutes provide’. \nFigure 1.1 Correct reference to primary legislation \nThere is only one online offcial site for UK legislation, which is free and can be located at \nwww.legislation.gov.uk . Other subscription-only online sites exist. Your library should be \nable to give you access to some of these. \nIn some modules, your lecturers might ask you to buy a statute book – a printed col -\nlection containing the latest versions of all relevant statutes for this module. In that case, do invest in the statute book early on and get used to its structure from the beginning. You might be allowed to take it into the exam, which can be a big help. \nThere are a range of publications that provide lawyers, students and researchers \nwith lists of legislation; these are arranged either chronologically or by subject matter. The domestic legislation currently in force has been created by Parliament over the past 700 years, but most of the legislation has been created since 1850. \n\n--- Page 44 ---\n   \n \n \n \n   DOMESTIC LEGISLATION 13 \nSECONDARY LEGISLATION \nSYNONYMS FOR SECONDARY LEGISLATION \nSubordinate legislation OR delegated legislation \nDIFFERENT TYPES OF SECONDARY LEGISLATION \n1.

It is made up of three ele -\nments. There are two Houses, the elected Members of Parliament (MPs) in the House of Commons (which is often referred to as the ‘commons’ or less often ‘the lower house’) and the non-elected Lords and Ladies (or ‘Peers’) in the House of Lords (which \n\n--- Page 45 ---\n \n \n \n 14 DOMESTIC LEGISLATION  \nis often just referred to as ‘the Lords’, and less often ‘the upper house’). Both Houses \nof Parliament acting together must agree on the exact wording of legislation. The third element is the monarch, who must give their Royal Assent to all legislation for it to be legitimately enacted. \nThe House of Commons \nThe House of Commons is currently composed of 650 Members of Parliament elected by members of the public who are eligible to vote and contains representatives from the four nations, England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. For this purpose the entire country is divided into constituencies containing one MP. \nSince the Fixed Term Parliament Act 2011, general elections of all members of the \nHouse of Commons usually take place every fve years. In practice, the prime minister has a two-month leeway before or after the expiry of fve years in which to hold the election. The only other way in which an earlier general election could take place would be if there were a successful vote of ‘no-confdence’ in the government passed in the Commons and no alternative government could be formed; or if a two-thirds majority of the House of Commons agreed to an early general election. If an MP resigns or dies, a by-election is held to replace them. \nThe House of Lords \nThe House of Lords is composed of unelected Lords (currently around 800). The majority of these have been appointed (the so-called ‘life peers’), 92 have inherited their title and were elected by the other members of the nobility, and 26 are Bishops of the Church of England. Under the Parliament Act 1949 they have the power to delay legislation for one year but do not have a complete veto. \nRoyal Assent \nThere is also a fnal formal agreement to legislation given by the fgurehead of the state, the monarch. The convention is that the monarch does not refuse consent (the last time this happened was in 1708). \nThe power of government to create legislation \nGiven that the Lords can only delay, and the monarch cannot dissent, the practical centre of power is in the House of Commons. Furthermore, as the government normally con -\ntrols the majority in the Commons, due to it being the party with the most votes in the Commons, it is the government that is the seat of power with only limited checks and balances on the exercise of that power. \n\n--- Page 46 ---\n   \n DOMESTIC LEGISLATION 15 \nTYPES OF DOMESTIC LEGISLATION: PRIMARY AND SECONDARY \nSo far we have noted that Parliament authorises the creation of a range of different types \nof legal rule generally subdivided into primary and secondary legislation, both of which are united by the fact that they are created in a fxed verbal form. The phrase ‘fxed verbal form’ means that only those  words in that order with that punctuation (if any) were agreed \nby Parliament as containing the legal rule.\n9 \nLegislation is classifed as either primary or secondary legislation, bo th of which are \nimportant and they will now be considered in turn. \nTypes of primary legislation \nThere are several types of legislative Act that can become a primary Act of Parliament: \nPublic General Acts \nThese mostly originate through the daily work of government departments and affect the general public. Some may be the result of implementing electoral promises. On occasion they can be created in response to public concern over a controversial problem. Public General Acts comprise the vast majority of primary legislation and will therefore be the main area of focus. \nPrivate Acts \nThese go through the same procedures in Parliament to become law as a Public General Act. But private Acts only contain rules applying to a specifc geographical area, or to a particular institution, or even just one person. They do not apply to all members of the public. Not surprisingly, such Acts are rare. \nHybrid Acts \nThese affect the general public but additionally a smaller locality or group may well be particularly affected by the legislation in ways that may be onerous. The legislation is usu -\nally required to allow work of national beneft and importance to take place. \nOrders in Council by virtue of the royal prerogative \nThis is an order made on the authority of the monarch. By tradition prime ministers use such orders for political appointments. In times of emergency the government can use Orders in Council as a quick response. They can be used to change the decision of courts \n9 A lthough, as you will see in Chapter 7 , judges interpreting words and phrases in court will often deal in the \nsubstitution of words. \n\n--- Page 47 ---\n 16 DOMESTIC LEGISLATION  \nthat apply to British Overseas Territories without an Act of Parliament. Only a Public \nGeneral Act can be used to reverse a domestic court’s decision. \nPrivate members’ bills \nA private member’s bill is a type of public bill that is not introduced by the government but by an individual member of the House of Lords or the House of Commons. The only condition attaching to this right is that the person concerned must not be a government minister. Such bills follow the normal procedure for the enactment of a statute. One of their values is allowing there to be a debate on an issue. Even a private member’s bill that has not been enacted can have an impact on legislation that later comes from the govern -\nment after serious issues have been aired in debate in the Houses of Parliament during the progress of the private members’ bill. \nTHE PROCEDURES LEADING TO THE ENACTMENT \nOF A PUBLIC GENERAL ACT \nA primary legislative Act, applying generally to all of the public within the state is called \na Public General Act. The bulk of primary legislation is in the form of Public General Acts and therefore the focus is on the Public General Act. Prior to enactment the draft legisla -\ntion is called a bill. \nProcedures for enacting legislation can be broken down into four main areas: \n  Pre-legislative procedures. \n  The passage of the bill through Parliament. \n  Royal Assent. \n  The ‘in force’ date of the Act. \nPre-legislative procedures Public General Bill \nTechnically the processes before a bill is introduced in Parliament are collectively referred to as the pre-legislative procedures. These include getting the views of the public and institutions by informal or formal consultations; and drafting the legislation. \nPublic consultation, Green Papers and White Papers \nIdeas about proposals for future legislation usually go through a consultation period, and on some occasions, a thorough pre-legislative scrutiny by experts in the feld. Modern government relies on consultation prior to bills being drafted to see if it will obtain support from those affected, the so-called ‘stakeholders’. Negative feedback will not necessarily \n\n--- Page 48 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n                          \n DOMESTIC LEGISLATION 17 \nstop a government from forwarding proposed legislation, but it will make it think carefully \nabout its proposals before proceeding. \nThe relevant government department or minister of state may publish a completely \nexploratory report asking for general views, which is bound in a green cover and referred to as a Green Paper. Or it may issue a discussion paper with an attached prospective bill to generate more specifc comment. Bound in white, this is called a White Paper. Both are called ‘command’ papers from the header in each, which states: \nPresented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for … by Command of Her Majesty. \nFor example, the coalition government published its White Paper, ‘Water for Life’, on 8 December 2011.\n10 The government department publishing this White Paper was \nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Each government department has its own select committee and DEFRA’s select committee\n11 voiced their concerns over matters in \nthe proposed legislation. They undertook an inquiry into the White Paper and published their fndings on 5 July 2012. Shortly after this the government published a draft Water Bill. A set period of time is usually given for responses to a consultation. \nThe public is usually given a number of months to reply to a call for views on issues \nin White and Green Papers, and some organisations are explicitly invited to respond to proposals. All such responses are published in Hansard\n12 as government papers. \nThe parliamentary outreach programme also runs free ‘public bill workshops’ to let \nmembers of the public know how to engage with proposals for legislation.13 These include \nonline opportunities to respond. \nDrafting of a Public General bill by parliamentary counsel \nGovernment bills are drafted by lawyers employed as civil servants in the Offce of Parliamentary Counsel (an offce dating back to 1869). \nBefore the Offce of Parliamentary Counsel will accept instructions from a govern -\nment department to draft a bill it must have a European Convention on Human Rights Memorandum,\n14 stating that the proposed legislation is compatible with the Convention. \nThis memo, formally a statement of compatibility, must be printed on the front of the bill. A bill can still be drafted and journey through Parliament in the absence of a memoran -\ndum of compatibility, but there would need to be a most compelling reason given by the government for choosing to go ahead anyway. \nIt is the civil servants in the relevant government department promoting the bill \nthat instructs parliamentary counsel to draft the bill. When full instructions are sent to \n10 Ref: PB13689. \n11 Each government department has an assigned select committee. \n12 Hansard is responsible for ensuring the verbatim notation of all parliamentary debates and proceedings in \ncommit as well as a range of other parliamentary papers. Publication is by the Stationery Offce (TSO). \n13 http://www.w4mp.org/library/your-offce-guides/organising-things-diary-meetings-and-events/parl \niamentary-outreach-free-service-for-the-public/ accessed 2 November 2020. \n14 See Human Rights Act 1998 c. 42, s 19(1)(a) – this is technically referred to as a memorandum of \ncompatibility. \n\n--- Page 49 ---\n \n           \n \n \n 18 DOMESTIC LEGISLATION  \nparliamentary counsel the relevant government department should also inform them of \nany existing judicial interpretation of legislation that may be relevant to understanding what the current law is. Also, the department should lay out any legal concepts that they are using in instructing the drafting of the bill. Parliamentary counsel also expects the instructions to include alerts when there are any arrangements in the bill proposing to give secondary legislative powers to another person or institution. Counsel will then advise the relevant government department, or a minister, whether what they wish to do is possible from a technical, legal perspective. \nThe bill is divided into small parts called clauses. Linked clauses are usually put \ntogether. These clauses become sections if the bill becomes an Act. \nThe parliamentary legislative timetable \nAt the commencement of each parliamentary session the monarch gives a speech written by ‘her government’ outlining the legislation planned for the current session. Government control of the parliamentary legislative timetable is absolutely key to the success of gov -\nernment bills. \nTwo cabinet committees determine which bills will be presented and when. ‘The legislation committee’ is responsible for the timing of bills in the current Parliament \nand is responsible for drawing up a programme from the Queen’s speech. The ‘future leg -\nislation committee’ determines the bills to go forward in the next session of Parliament. \nThe passage of a public bill through Parliament \nOnce the legislation has been drafted then it has to face a strict series of procedures as it travels through Parliament. Each public bill has three readings, a committee stage and a report stage, in both Houses of Parliament. After the committee stage a report is sent to the relevant House on changes to the bill. A bill can be introduced initially in either House, although most are introduced into the House of Commons. However, the House of Commons can, after waiting for one year, ignore the dissent of the House of Lords using the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949.\n15 \nPassage of a bill through the House of Commons \nFirst reading \nThis is a mere formality; the only requirement is that the short title16 of the bill is read out \nin the House. Each bill, and subsequently each Act, has a long title set out in its preamble \n(see later in the chapter)17 and a short title which is determined by a section (sections are \nexplained later in this chapter) in the Act and this is the title by which it is known. A time is then set for a second reading. Conventionally this should be after the passing of two weekends. \n15 The delay was initially two years in the 1911 legislation which was reduced to one year in the 1949 legisla -\ntion. Before the 1911 Act, the House of Lords could veto any bill. \n16 See below for details of the short title. Each bill and subsequent Act has a long and a short title. These \nmatters are discussed in detail in Chapter 11 . \n17 A bill is divided into clauses which become sections in the Act. \n\n--- Page 50 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n DOMESTIC LEGISLATION 19 \nSecond reading \nThis is a full debate in the House of the issues raised by the legislation. The relevant min -\nister or spokesperson will introduce the bill. This is immediately followed by the ‘offcial’ \nopposition shadow minister or spokesperson responding.18 After this a general debate \nopens up, and at the end of the debate there is a vote to determine if the bill can continue its passage through the House. The bill must receive a majority of those voting to con -\ntinue on its way. MPs do not have to be in the debating chamber of the House to vote. They can slip into the chamber near the time for a vote. \nVoting procedures \nWhen the time for voting arrives the Speaker of the House of Commons will ask all mem -\nbers present in the Commons chamber to simultaneously call out their agreement or dis -\nsent to the bill.19 This is a noisy event. The Speaker will then gauge from what he or she \nhas heard if the bill has majority support or not. If it is unclear the Speaker will call for a vote by ‘division’. \nIt is called a division because the House physically divides for the purposes of voting. \nAll MPs are asked to show their support or dissent by either walking out of the chamber into one of two areas, called division lobbies. One lobby is the ‘ayes’ (yes) lobby and the other the ‘noes’ lobby.\n20 \nDivision bells ring for eight minutes to allow MPs to arrive from elsewhere in the area of \nParliament. The bells are placed in a range of places within Parliament and its precincts. The sound of the bell for House of Lords divisions is different to that of the Commons. TV screens around Parliament and surrounding parliamentary and government buildings also indicate that a division is taking place.\n21 When the bell stops, the door to the chamber \nis locked. No one can gain access to vote if they have been locked out. \nClerks note the name of the MP as they vote by simply walking through the relevant \ndivision lobby. Those acting as ‘tellers’ of the vote to the Speaker count the MPs through from the chamber into the division lobby and the Speaker announces the result. If there is a tied vote then the Speaker has the casting vote (this is a very rare occurrence). This authority belongs to the Speaker because of a constitutional convention\n22 known as \nSpeaker Denison’s rule.23 Another constitutional convention states that the Speaker must \nmaintain the status quo by voting in favour of the government. \nThe division lobby process can take at least 15–20 minutes and often much longer. \nHowever, it is also possible to have a deferred division that allows MPs to vote at a con -\nvenient time during a limited timescale. The votes in a deferred division remain public to match the lobby/bar procedures for accountability. This can be seen to mirror the frst \n18 The political party not in government in the House of Commons with the largest number of MPs is the \noffcial opposition. They appoint MPs to ‘shadow’ government ministers, the ‘shadow minister’. They will \nrespond to them in debates. \n19 In the House of Lords it is the Lord Speaker who deals with this matter. \n20 In the House of Lords the Lords walk through the ‘bar’ and the lobbies are known as ‘consent’ and ‘not \nconsent’. \n21 Through a feed called the ‘annunciator service’. \n22 An unwritten rule that is important to the UK’s constitution. \n23 Denison was Speaker of the House of Commons from 1857 to 1872. \n\n--- Page 51 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 20 DOMESTIC LEGISLATION  \nvote after any debate when MPs shout out their views from their seat on the benches. \nThe ‘division list’ is a list of the way in which each Member of Parliament voted and is published the next day in Hansard, and posted on the Parliament website. \nCommittee stage \nA bill that successfully passes the second reading is sent to a public bill committee com -\nposed of 16–50 MPs chosen to maintain the political representation of the parties in the House. So the government will usually have a majority in the committee, with the next high -\nest number of places going to the offcial opposition. It is usually hoped that a bill can go to the committee within a few weeks of the second reading. But the parliamentary timetable is always full and the wait may be longer. Amendments to clauses can be put forward by committee members. However, only the Chair of the committee can decide which amend -\nments are discussed. A list of amendments to the bills in committee is published each day. Votes are taken clause by clause, after detailed scrutiny, and every clause must be either: \n  agreed; \n  agreed as amended; or \n  removed. \nIf the bill is amended then it is reprinted and there is a report stage where it is sent back \nto the House. \nReport stage \nThis takes place in the whole House,24 giving all MPs a chance to debate amendments to \nthe bill in committee. However, unlike the other stages there is no ideal timescale set for the report stage. There may well be attempts to undo changes previously secured at the committee stage. MPs can also forward new proposals for amendments. Debates can continue for several days or even weeks. \nThird reading \nThis usually takes place on the same day as the report stage fnishes, and it is the fnal debate on the contents of the bill. If a clear agreement to the bill is ascertained before a debate there will usually be a motion\n25 calling for the House to proceed to a vote without a \ndebate. If the bill is approved it is tied with a green ribbon and sent to the House of Lords with a request from the House of Commons that it is approved. \nPassage of a bill through the House of Lords \nThe procedure in the House of Lords basically mirrors that in the House of Commons: frst reading, second reading, committee stage, report stage, third reading. \nIt is worth noting, however, that the Speaker of the House of Lords does not have a \ncasting vote in the event of a tied vote of the House. Also, when a vote takes place in the \n24 In rare instances the committee stage can take place as a committee of the whole House. \n25 A motion is the technical term for an MP making a proposal to the House. \n\n--- Page 52 ---\n   \n DOMESTIC LEGISLATION 21 \nchamber, rather than saying ‘ayes’ or ‘noes’, the phrases used are ‘consent’ and ‘not \nconsent’. \nAmendment consideration \nAt the end of the third reading in the House of Lords the bill comes to rest, and it is returned to the originating House of Commons, so that they can consider amendments made by the House of Lords. \nBefore a bill can become an enacted statute, all  wording in it must be agreed upon \nby both Houses of Parliament. You can see now why it is most appropriate to state that legislation is law enacted in a ‘fxed verbal form’. If the House of Commons disagrees with the amendments from the House of Lords and/or makes further amendments of its own, the bill has to go back to the Lords. A bill can be sent back to the Commons again after the Lords have considered the new amendments and agreed or disagreed. \nThis ‘to and fro’ process is referred to as ‘ping pong’ after the game of table tennis. \nIf the House of Lords delay the bill due to disagreements, then the Parliament Acts can be used as noted above to allow the fnal consent to come from the House of Commons only. The House of Lords has delayed and refused consent on several notable statutes in recent years, including the Sexual Offences Amendment Act 2000 and the Hunting Act 2005. \nIt used to be the case that if a bill had not successfully completed all its stages through \nthe two Houses by the end of the parliamentary session it was ‘lost’. Those opposing it would deliberately try to delay it as long as possible in its passage through debates and committees so that the end of the parliamentary session was reached and the bill was lost. However, in 1998 the House of Commons Modernisation Committee proposed that it should be possible to carry over bills that have not completed their passage from one session to the next and since 2004 this has been a Standing Order of the House of Commons. \nRoyal Assent \nEven if the bill receives agreement from the House of Lords and the House of Commons it cannot become law until the monarch has assented to it. There is no legal rule that states the monarch must assent but by convention the monarch does always assent. The last time the monarch refused to assent to an Act was in 1708. The Royal Assent Act 1967 provides for formal assent by notifcation and there just needs to be a formal read -\ning in both Houses of the short title of the Act signifying assent. Once the Royal Assent process has been completed the Act is ordered to be printed by The Stationery Offce.\n26 \nDate in force of the Act \nUnless the statute states anything to the contrary, an Act becomes law on the day it receives Royal Assent, and for the avoidance of doubt the whole of that day is included. \n26 TSO are the offcially sanctioned publishers for all UK legislation, command papers, House of Commons \nor Lords papers, select committee reports and of Hansard. \n\n--- Page 53 ---\n \n   \n 22 DOMESTIC LEGISLATION  \nIt may be the case that the whole of a statute has a delayed ‘in force’ date (for example, \nthe Equal Pay Act 1970 did not come into force until 1975). \nMore usually it is individual sections of an Act that have delayed and different dates for \ncoming into legal force. The statute itself may just contain a general permissive section \nstating that various parts of the legislation come into force, if they come into force at all, on a day to be set by the relevant authorised minister by order.\n27 \nThe date in force is an important aspect of legal method and you should carefully check \nin Halsbury or the offcial online site for legislation ( www.legislation.gov.uk ) to ascertain \nthe current position of individual sections of any statute that you are researching. \nSECONDARY LEGISLATION \nIn addition to creating primary legislation, Parliament can, by Act of Parliament, delegate the power to create legislation to others such as a minister of the Crown and various professional, regulatory or statutory bodies. Such power is limited to the creation of bind -\ning laws relevant to that body. For example, local authorities have the power to enact secondary legislation, called bylaws, relating to certain matters within their geographical jurisdiction. Ministers enact secondary legislation in the form of statutory instruments when the right to make certain changes to primary legislation has been given to them in the primary legislation itself. \nSecondary legislation can also occur as private and local, but this is rarer and we will \nnot be looking at these matters in detail. \nFigure 1 .3 below gives you a basic idea of the detail of the different types of secondary \nlegislation. It is divided into a range of types but it is statutory instruments that form the bulk of what we generically refer to as delegated or subordinate legislation. \nParliamentary control over secondary legislation \nSecondary legislation does not need to go through the full parliamentary procedure used for primary legislation. This makes it quick to create and saves precious parliamentary time. It also provides fexibility in law making, and often allows those most involved with an area to create the rules. For example, professional bodies are better placed to enact rules regulating their own professions, and local authorities have a better understanding of local issues. \nThis process does raise questions about the adequacy of parliamentary scrutiny of \nsecondary legislation. This is particularly important in relation to powers given to govern -\nment ministers to amend and repeal primary legislation under the Regulatory Reform Order mechanism. \nWhile much secondary legislation is delegated under the authority of primary legisla -\ntion there is an exception in relation to Orders by Council.

Additionally the House of Commons has its own Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. Secondary legislation relating to local authority bylaws goes to a separate committee. \nStatutory instruments, the largest group of secondary legislation are drafted by the \nlegal offcers in the relevant government department after consultation with interested parties. \nThey have different terminology to that used in primary legislation and instead of being \nenacted they are ‘made’. They can, however, be ‘laid’ before Parliament as a draft for approval or ‘made’ for a motion for annulment or rejection within a set timescale. If there is no motion at the expiry of the set time they are then ‘in force’. These terms are set out below in Figure 1 .4. \nProcedure for making statutory instruments \nAs the majority of secondary legislation is made under a delegated power to make a statutory instrument (SI) we will concentrate on this to give you a good foundation for understanding the procedure. \nMost SIs are subject to a parliamentary procedure, either the affrmative resolution or \nthe negative resolution referred to below, and follow the procedures for both as set out in the Statutory Instruments Act 1946, ss 4 and 5. The enabling (or parent) Act will prescribe the procedure that is to be used in relation to specifc statutory instruments. \nAll SIs that have to go through the parliamentary procedure must contain explanatory \nnotes setting out their scope. The procedures are relatively simple, as set out below. \n\n--- Page 56 ---\n   DOMESTIC LEGISLATION 25 \nIt is worth noting that the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, which allow primary leg -\nislation to become law without the agreement of the House of Lords, do not apply to sec -\nondary legislation. If the House of Lords object, then the SI cannot proceed. A few SIs are \nlimited by the parent legislation to obtaining only the approval of the House of Commons. \nThe negative resolution procedure \nThe SI is laid before Parliament in draft format and left for 40 days to see if there is any objection (which is in fact quite rare). If there is an objection, then the SI is lost. \nAlternatively, the SI is laid as made and there is a 40-day period to see if there is a \nmotion called a ‘prayer to annul’ during those 40 days. If not, it becomes legally binding. \nThe affrmative resolution procedure \nBoth Houses of Parliament must approve the SI. The SI can initially be laid as a draft order, then later printed and placed into the numerical run of SIs. It cannot be ‘made’ unless both Houses approve it. Or it can be laid after making, but it cannot come into force until it is approved. Another option is that it can be laid after making but cannot remain in force unless it has approval from the House of Commons and Lords within a statutory period of days (which is usually somewhere between 28 and 40 days). \nThe super-affrmative procedure \nThe powers delegated to ministers by the parent Act may require proposals for SIs to be subject to the super-affrmative procedure, which requires them to lay before Parliament for a set period of days. They are then drafted with notes taken of any comments made. Other delegated legislation can also require this procedure. \nDebates to affrm or annul SIs \nIt is diffcult to fnd parliamentary time to debate these matters. Usually motions are heard late in the parliamentary day on the foor of the House or in one of the committees dealing with delegated legislation. \nOther parliamentary procedures \nThere is provision for some SIs to be laid for a set period but they do not require any scrutiny, and some SIs do not have to be laid at all. \nLists of statutory instruments laid before Parliament \nLists of statutory instruments laid, approved and going through parliamentary proce -\ndures are published regularly by the parliamentary publications offce so that members of \n\n--- Page 57 ---\n \n  \n \n   26 DOMESTIC LEGISLATION  \nUK DOMESTIC LEGISLATION \nPrimary \nLegisla\u0006on \nHybrid \nActs Private \nActs \nApplying to \nIndividuals \nIncluding personal \nActs to \nchange name Applying \nto groups Public \nGeneral \nAct Orders in \nCouncil \n(using the \nroyal \npreroga\u0003ve) Secondary \nLegisla\u0006on \nBylaws \nfor Local \nAuthori\u0003es Church \nMeasures \nRegula\u0003ons Statutory \nInstruments \n(Including \nOrders in \nCouncil) \nHybrid SIs \nFigure 1.5 Types of UK domestic legislation \nthe two Houses know where a SI is in its cycle of days. Figure 1 .5 ‘Types of UK domestic \nlegislation’ sets out primary and secondary forms for your quick reference. Note that \nOrders in Council can manifest themselves as primary legislation (in relation to the royal prerogative), but in all other areas Orders in Council are secondary legislation in the form of statutory instruments. \nUSING LEGISLATION AND UNDERSTANDING \nJUDICIAL STATUTORY INTERPRETATION \nIt is particularly important to note that legislative language can be complex in its format \nand has the following characteristics: \n  unusual grammatical forms; \n  complex structure; \n  tediously literal, dense text; \n  scant punctuation; \n  peppered with hierarchical alphabetical and numerical dividers. \nLegislation as enacted will have inbuilt defnitions of new terms, as well as a change in \ndefnitions of old terms for the purposes of a new area. It will contain defences (if appli -\ncable), and guidance with regard to the interpretation of certain specifed terms or proce -\ndures. Inevitably the judiciary are required to interpret the meaning of words or phrases in a statute. This is known as statutory interpretation or judicial interpretation. \nThe complexity of legal language has repercussions when the language of legislation \nis the object of interpretation. But it is not just complex language: ordinary words can \n\n--- Page 58 ---\n   \n \n \n   \n DOMESTIC LEGISLATION 27 \ncause interpretational headaches. In Mandla v Dowell-Lee28 a claim of indirect discrimi-\nnation rested on the interpretation of the word ‘can’. The query was whether the word \n‘can’ meant ‘can physically’ or ‘can religiously – therefore can in the sphere of thought and belief’. \nThe Act under consideration may have gone through extensive debate concerning the \nwording of sections, both on the foor of the two Houses of Parliament and in committees. It is important that the judiciary in the most senior courts engage in statutory interpreta -\ntion to decide the fnal meaning of a word of a phrase in a statute. However, judges have actually changed the presumed intention of Parliament by their interpretation of legisla -\ntion. This creates important and interesting debates about the power of the judiciary. The Act would not have been passed if the elected representatives did not support it. But the judiciary are not elected by the public in a democratic manner. \nCONCLUSION \nIt is essential to know and understand the processes for the creation of primary and sec -\nondary legislation and the structure of Parliament, the ultimate creators of legislation. But this information is only the background to being able to fnd and understand primary and secondary legislation so that you can competently construct legal arguments or critique aspects of them. Chapter 6 considers in detail how to fnd legislation in both its enacted and draft forms. Chapter 7 looks at issues of understanding it. Chapter 7 also includes a deeper consideration of statutory interpretation by the judiciary and an explanation of the relationship between cases and legislation. \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  Legislation is enacted by the UK Parliament. \n  Legislation can be primary or secondary. \n  Primary legislation is enacted by Parliament. \n  Secondary legislation is enacted by others using powers given by primary legislation. \n  Legislation is law in a fxed verbal form. \n  Domestic legislation is the dominant form of law making in the English legal system. Parliament is split into two main ‘Houses’ or ‘chambers’. \n  The House of Commons is composed of 650 elected Members of Parliament. \n  The House of Lords is not elected, but mostly appointed. \n  There is only one online offcial site for UK legislation which can be located at www.legislation.gov.uk . \n  MPs and Lords have means by which they can present a private member’s bill. \n28 [1983] 1 All ER 1062. \n\n--- Page 59 ---\n 28 DOMESTIC LEGISLATION  \n  Drafting of a government bill is by parliamentary counsel in the Offce of Parliamentary \nCounsel. \n  The passage of a public bill through Parliament is the same in both Houses as fol -\nlows: frst reading, second reading, committee stage, report stage, third reading. \n  Drafting of statutory instruments varies. Generally, however, it is the civil servants in the government department covering the area of the parent Act who draft SIs. \n\n--- Page 60 ---\n2 \n  \n DOMESTIC CASE LAW \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Appreciate the development of common law and equity. \n  Understand the relationship between common law and equity. \n  Have a frm grasp of the hierarchy of courts. \n  Begin to understand the role and importance of the doctrine of precedent. \n  Have an understanding of the basic jurisdiction of domestic courts. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-3  \n\n--- Page 61 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 30 DOMESTIC CASE LAW \nINTRODUCTION \nCase law is the law created by the senior judges deciding disputes in the law courts. The \nlaw that is created in this way is called the ‘common law’, a phrase used here in its nar -\nrower sense of judge-made law rather than in its wider sense of all of the law (legislative and judge-made) common to the English legal system. \nDuring your legal education, you will be required to read many cases. They are often \nthe legal authority pointed to for the presentation of legal arguments. It is important that you understand the law produced by these cases. Today, legislation is the main form of law making, but the judiciary has a major role to play in relation to statutory interpretation. \nThis chapter briefy describes the development of common law and equity, outlines \nthe role of custom, and considers the structure, jurisdiction and judicial personnel of the courts. It also introduces the tribunal system, often a source of misunderstanding for students, and explains how in some circumstances it can interlink with the court system. \nKey to the understanding of case law is the ability to appreciate the doctrine of \nprecedent, which is briefy explained in this chapter, but an in-depth consideration of it is reserved for Chapter 8 , ‘Reading and understanding cases’. Equally important is to \nensure you can competently locate the most up to date cases expressing legal principles or statutory defnitions. Chapter 6 , ‘Finding material’, deals with these issues. \nThe development of the common law \nEnglish law is described as being a common law system the creation and development of which was a by-product of the Norman invasion in 1066, as the conquerors required a law that would apply to everyone, ‘royal law’. There is, however, much that is unknown about the development of the common law. Historical sources are vague about its development, the level of infuence exerted by Roman law\n1 and the precise nature of the range of local \nlegal rules and differing legal systems operating in England prior to the Norman conquest. Much of the development of the common law and the institutions supporting it between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries remains uncertain. \nBefore 1066 there was evidence of separate systems of law operating in different \nareas of England controlled by different tribes (e.g. Danelaw, Wessex law, Mercian law). It is known that Roman law was infuential in Europe generally between the frst and fourth centuries, and that it was through Roman law that Christianity frst exerted an infuence on the English legal system. Despite this, Roman law was not popular in England (although some of our concepts in commercial law can be traced back to Roman law origins). \nWhat is clear is that as the Norman conquerors sought over successive centuries \nto centralise their power in the fragmented political and legal landscape of England, they centralised the law. The Normans developed a fexible system of political control covering the whole of England and Wales, giving power to the aristocracy in return for their loyalty to the monarch. The Normans were content to combine the legal rules and legal systems of local communities with a mix of their own rules. In this way no one \n1 In England, Roman law was only used in the church courts of the Roman Catholic Church, still at that time \nunder the political and religious power of Rome. The courts of the monarch never used Roman law. \n\n--- Page 62 ---\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n DOMESTIC CASE LAW 31 \ncommunity felt that the new legal rules were completely alien. However, because these \nrules were nationalised, ultimately all legal disputes were heard by the Norman mon -\narchs. So whilst differing localised rules and laws operated in selected areas, it was the monarch who offered the ‘common law’, the new royal justice for all. The development of the common law usurped the authority of the local landowners and tribal leaders to resolve disputes. \nIt could be said that fexibility was the supreme act of political diplomacy of the \nNormans. Initially, they maintained that it was not necessary for the English common law to claim exclusive  jurisdiction. This allowed space for the range of localised legal \nsystems to shape English common law. As long as political loyalty locally was intact then local laws were tolerated as part of the nationalised system, with common law, the royal justice, offering dispute resolution in the courts. Over time, however, the Crown claimed exclusive jurisdiction for the common law over all other forms of law. \nOne of the frst needs of the Normans was to have a judiciary capable of effectively \nand effciently dispensing and developing their unifed laws. They were initially restricted by their language ability and local hostility. The judiciary needed to be highly literate, but the obvious choice, the aristocracy, was hostile towards them. In their need they turned to the literate, ordained clerics of the Roman Catholic Church and trained them to be judges in the royal courts. Inevitably Christian infuence and ethics became instilled in the developing common law. \nThese newly appointed ‘judge-clerics’ travelled the country on the monarch’s author -\nity, hearing major criminal disputes, reading evidence, hearing witnesses and deliver -\ning judgment. These journeys and records formed a travelling, localised justice that was centralised administratively. It was this innovation that was to develop ultimately into the unifed ‘common law’ legal system nationalised in terms of administration, jurisdiction, adjudication and law creation. This construction of a law that was common to all came to be referred to as the common law of England – a common law built up from judges’ deci -\nsions as well as the commands of the sovereign. \nIn the early centuries after the Norman invasion, a number of methods of dispute reso -\nlution existed locally alongside the royal, court-based common law. Most of these meth -\nods, such as the blood feud,\n2 trial by battle3 and trial by ordeal4 had their origins in dispute \nresolution within tribal settings. Defendants at criminal law, and litigants at civil law, could initially choose between royal justice and other methods to resolve their legal dispute. \nThe drawback associated with royal justice was its cost, and the fact that if a person \nwere found guilty of breaking the King’s peace – that is, acting against the Crown – his lands and monies would be forfeited to the Crown, leaving his family destitute. Many people elected to die under torture so that local justice would take effect and land and possessions would pass to the family, not the Crown. However, in time litigants began to accept using royal justice for dispute resolution. \n2 W hen the family of a victim sought to exact revenge by killing members of the aggressor’s family. \n3 W hen two sides to a dispute resolved it by engaging each other in battle, or by sponsoring a champion to \nfght on their behalf. \n4 T rial by ordeal was a pagan ritual but was taken over by politics and Christianity. The accused person was \nsubjected to an ordeal. There were several recognised ordeals such as the ‘ordeal of water’, the ‘hot water \nordeal’, the ‘ordeal of the cursed morsel’ and the ‘fre ordeals’. The support of the Church to trial by ordeal was forbidden in 1215. \n\n--- Page 63 ---\n   \n 32 DOMESTIC CASE LAW \nAs law professionalised during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the teaching of \nEnglish law took place via apprenticeships. Judges needed clerks, and litigants needed \nthose who understood the law to advise them of the procedures and arguments that the law required. \nLegal education took place in specialist Inns of Court, the only places which taught \nthe common law necessary for the education of the legal professionals who worked in the royal courts. They were known as ‘inns’ of court because living and working space for lawyers and their students was merged into one area. The development of the role of barrister was made possible through the creation of the Inns of Court, the earliest of which were attached to churches because of the close connection between the clerics and the judges. \nThe universities of Oxford and Cambridge limited the legal instruction they offered to \nRoman law, ignoring the development of the common law. Roman law was considered to be more academically demanding with its links to the idea of a classical education. It was not until the seventeenth century that the frst law schools at Oxford and Cambridge began to turn their attention to the common law. \nAs the common law system evolved and judicial reasoning became more expansive, \nmany justifcations for law were grounded in Christian morality and illustrated with refer -\nence to the Christian sacred text, the Holy Bible. When Henry VIII instigated the split from the Roman Catholic Church in the sixteenth century he changed the nature of the rela -\ntionship between the Christian religion and the state by retaining Christianity in its Roman Catholic form but removing it from the authority of Rome, and replacing that authority with his own. So he Anglicised it, and assumed the role of the Defender of the Faith – the head and protector of the religion. Another consequence of the split was that the church courts (those which dealt with matters relating to religion) which had formerly been under the authority of Rome, became courts Christian, or the ecclesiastical courts, functioning as part of the English legal system. These courts are still operating today but with a more limited jurisdiction. \nReligion was used for many centuries as the litmus test of loyalty to the Crown, and \nreligious oaths were required before people were allowed to engage in many senior public jobs. Increasingly in the common law courts, judges maintained that Christian law and ethics were an integral part of the law of England, a view that continued to be held until the twentieth century. \nThe characteristics of common law became its communality, its inclusivity and its \npreference for providing supplementary legal rules rather than fxed absolutes. The com -\nmon law remained fexible, making it capable of intricate adaptations to situations. These adaptations eventually produced the judge-made common law we work with today, along with the methods of argument preferred by the English legal system, methods that allow permutations and interpretations of those existing rules. \nEventually after several centuries the common law as a whole developed serious prob -\nlems. Its valued inherent fexibility was lost and it became a rigid system of legal rules. Much of the problem lay in the procedure for bringing a case to the royal courts. A litigant \n\n--- Page 64 ---\n    \n \n \n \n DOMESTIC CASE LAW 33 \nhad to buy a special form, called a writ, from the Chancellor’s offce. But it was not an \nopen general form where a grievance could be stated. It was highly specifc and a pro -\nspective litigant had to fnd the right one from hundreds of writs to cover the details of their case. Otherwise they risked their case being thrown out. \nThe writ system meant that bringing a legal case in the royal courts was extremely \nexpensive. Court cases were also subject to heavy delays that could run into years. Another potential problem for a claimant was that they could only ask for fnancial com -\npensation (monetary damages) even though money alone may not have constituted ade -\nquate recompense. A claimant may have needed certain possessions to be restored or returned, or for someone to stop doing something (or do something they were required to do). Common law therefore became unable to meet the demands of claimants. \nDEVELOPMENT OF EQUITY \nRules that came to be known as ‘equitable rules’ began to develop as individual claim -\nants petitioned the Crown for relief from the defciencies of the common law. Although the monarch originally heard these cases in person, they were eventually delegated to the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor was a senior cleric in the politically and legally established Christian denomination, the Church of England. Because of his senior offce and his role in the Church the Lord Chancellor was known as ‘the keeper of the King’s conscience’. \nThe word equity is derived from the idea of fairness. The Chancellor was able to \nconsider matters from the perspective of fairness, rather than conform to the rigidity of the common law. He would ask questions such as ‘what would constitute a reason -\nable outcome?’, or ‘what is natural justice in the situation?’ From the decisions of the Chancellor, equitable rules were developed to assist decision making. As petitions to the Lord Chancellor grew in the ffteenth century, the Court of Chancery was established to hear cases. \nRivalries developed between the Lord Chancellors’ Court of Chancery and the com -\nmon law courts. This rivalry came to a head in 1614 in several cases. In the case of Courtney v Glanvil\n5 the head of the common law courts, the Lord Chief Justice, declared \nthat the chancery courts, which he called a court of equity, could not interfere with any decision of the common law courts. The response from the Lord Chancellor was to declare in the Earl of Oxford’s case\n6 that, on the contrary, the Court of Chancery had the \nrequired jurisdiction to set aside any decision of the common law courts. Ultimately, after a period of acrimony, the supremacy of equity over common law was established after the matter was referred to King James I and his Attorney General, Sir Francis Bacon. \nThe equitable rules that guided decision making in the chancery courts dealing with \nequity and remedies were broader than just the monetary damages of the common law. In equity defendants could be ordered to ‘stop doing’ something or ‘to do’ something \n5 (1614) Cro Jac 343, 79 ER 294. \n6 (1615) Rep Ch. \n\n--- Page 65 ---\n   \n \n \n 34 DOMESTIC CASE LAW \nand/or return possessions belonging to the claimant. But to obtain full compensation, \noften a litigant was put in the position of having to pay to bring a case in the court of equity for non-monetary remedies after having paid to go to a common law court to obtain monetary recompense. \nThis state of affairs continued well into the nineteenth century when the Supreme \nCourt of Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 declared that courts could dispense both common law and equitable rules using only one procedure. These Acts also gave statu -\ntory authority to the rule that should there be confict between a common law rule or an equitable rule then equity would prevail (a rule that is now found in the Senior Courts Act 1981, s 49). \nYou will come across equitable doctrines (or maxims), remedies and rights throughout \nyour study of law as they remain an important source of law. It is therefore important that you understand their origins and effect. Table 2 .1 above sets out an illustrative list of avail -\nable equitable maxims, remedies and rights.\n7 \nCUSTOM \nAs the common law developed it incorporated many local, unwritten, customary rules. A customary law or rule is a practice that communities agree is the only right way to act in that matter, because it is the ‘customary way’. Customs can change from generation to generation and between geographic areas. But these customs came to determine how a legal dispute would be dealt with and by whom. Smith and Keenan defne local custom in the following way: ‘local customs consist in the main of customary rights vested in the inhabitants of a particular place to use, for various purposes, land held in the private ownership of another’.\n8 \nOver time these oral customary rules held in the memory of communities were reduced \nto writing and became part of the common law. Slapper and Kelly note, ‘From this point of view, law may be seen as the redefnition of custom for the purposes of clarity and enforcement by legal institutions’.\n9 However, some schools of thought maintain that com -\nmon law legal rules and custom represent two completely different species of rules and that law often replaced custom rather than incorporating custom into itself. \nToday, if a person wishes to maintain that a local customary rule that conficts with a \ncommon law rule should be enforced they need to prove that the custom is reasonable, can be clearly set out and has existed peacefully without any interruptions from ‘time immemorial’ (agreed to be 1189). The normal situation now is that it is suffcient to show the custom has existed within ‘living memory’ rather than ‘time immemorial’. Furthermore, they must prove that there has been no clandestine aspect to the custom, and that it had been enjoyed without the use of force, or permission or underhandedness. Those who are raising the custom must demonstrate that they consider themselves to be bound by it and that the custom does not confict with other local customs. \n7 F or further reading on equity see G Slapper and D Kelly The English Legal System (19th edition, Routledge, \nLondon), 5–7. \n8 C Wild and S Weinstein Smith and Keenan’s English Law (17th edition, Longman, London, 2013), 6–9. \n9 S ee fn 7, 178. \n\n--- Page 66 ---\n    \n   \n \n \n \n  DOMESTIC CASE LAW 35 \nTABLE 2.1 AN ILLUSTRATIVE LIST OF EQUITABLE MAXIMS, REMEDIES \nAND RIGHTS \nEquitable maxims Equitable remedies Equitable rights \n‘He who comes to Specifc performance The equity of \nequity must come with A party to a contract is ordered to redemption \nclean hands’ perform their contractual obligations.

Customs are, how -\never, proved in court and are a source of case law. The criteria by which customs can be \nproved are also broad enough to allow the judiciary to refuse the validity of a local custom should they so wish. But if the judiciary consider the custom to be established and that it fts the above criteria then it will take priority over a conficting common law rule.\n10 \n10 Egerton v Harding  [1974] 3 WLR 437, LA 150 is an example of a customary rule being proved in court in \nrelatively modern times. \n\n--- Page 67 ---\n   \n \n 36 DOMESTIC CASE LAW \nENGLISH LAW AND THE DOCTRINE OF PRECEDENT \nThe decisions of judges in those courts considered to be senior courts must generally be \nfollowed by judges in the same or lower court: if the facts of the legal dispute are similar and the same legal rule is involved. This practice is known as the doctrine of precedent. The doctrine of precedent is reliant upon the existence of a court hierarchy and a good system of law reporting (or courts keeping a reliable, accessible transcript of the judg -\nment). Otherwise no one will know what was said in an earlier case.\n11 \nIt is often said by judges in their judgments that the doctrine of precedent has been \nobserved for centuries. But, like the history of the common law itself, the truth of such statements is unclear. There is evidence of such practice in some cases recorded over the centuries. \nOnly two things can be stated with some certainty. First, that the judiciary has main -\ntained a relatively strict adherence to the doctrine of precedent from the nineteenth cen -\ntury onwards and this coincided with a regularisation of law reporting. Second, whilst all legal systems have some concept of precedent, the English legal system is exceptional because of its strict adherence to the doctrine of precedent.\n12 Law reporting is considered \nin detail in Chapter 6 , and the doctrine of precedent is considered in detail in Chapter 8 . \nTHE COURTS \nAs you will have realised by now, courts of law are the institutions that hear and determine legal disputes based on the infringements of legal rules. Legal rules serve no purpose if there is not a system of offcially sanctioned institutions for the adjudication of legal dis -\nputes with powers, as appropriate, to: \n  punish the defendant in a criminal case or award damages and/or an equitable rem -\nedy to the complainant in a civil case; \n  ensure enforcement of its criminal law punishments or award of civil law remedies; \n  hear appeals from the outcome of trials. \nThe courts have developed over centuries, and very few were created by statute. At one \ntime, the royal courts were part of the monarch’s own household; however, as adjudica -\ntion became a full-time job it could not be conducted by the monarch alone. \nAs the powers of English monarchs were successively usurped or transferred to \nParliament, changes to the structure and administration of the courts have increasingly been made by legislation. New courts have also been created by legislation. But change was slow in coming. \nThe frst major overhaul of the structure (as well as the administration) of English civil \ncourts occurred in the nineteenth century through the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875. \nThe Judicature Acts led, among other things, to the setting up of a unifed system of \nappeal and the establishment of the Court of Appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeals was \n11 Law reporting is considered in more detail in Chapters 6 and 8. \n12 Precedent will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7 . \n\n--- Page 68 ---\n    \n \n     \n \n DOMESTIC CASE LAW 37 \nestablished by the Criminal Appeals Act 1907, and merged with the civil Court of Appeal \nin 1966. From that time onwards the Court of Appeal had a civil and a criminal division. Historically the House of Lords had a judicial function to hear appeals which, technically, were appeals to the Crown-in-Parliament. \nThe frst major overhaul of the criminal court structure did not happen until the Courts \nAct 1975, which led to the establishment of the Crown Court to hear criminal trials. \nThere have been various major changes to civil and criminal court structure and \nadministration since 1975. The Courts Act 2003 introduced far-reaching administrative changes to the organisation of English courts, unifying the administration of the English courts through a new institution, Her Majesty’s Courts Service (HMCS), which was set up in 2005. This was the result of government support for the fndings of a review of the criminal courts conducted by Sir Robert Auld and published in 2001.\n13 In 2011 the tribunal \nsystem was merged into HMCS, creating Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), fnally streamlining the organisation of courts and tribunals.\n14 \nHMCTS is part of the Justice Ministry; however, it is a completely separate agency. It \ncan currently be accessed at http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/hmcts/ . It encompasses all \ntrial courts and the Court of Appeal (criminal and civil divisions) but does not include the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 established the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom as the fnal court of appeal or court of last resort. \nEnglish law is today divided into many distinct areas, with the main areas being civil \nand criminal. Civil law can be further subdivided into a range of distinct specialisms, for example contract, family and employment. Civil and criminal cases are heard in differ -\nent courts, although often in practice a court will predominantly deal with one area, for example, criminal matters, and that court may (or may not) have a limited jurisdiction to deal with civil matters, and vice versa. \nCourts also specialise in the type of hearing they are predominantly engaged with, \ntrials, judicial reviews or appeals. Trials (also known as frst instance hearings) involve the presentation of evidence with witnesses usually being called and examined in open court (unless special arrangements have been made to have a live video link for such an examination). Parties to cases in trial courts can appeal through the appeals procedure within the court system. \nAppeal hearings involve hearing a dispute about the outcome of a trial, either in rela -\ntion to remedies awarded (civil actions) or sentence imposed (criminal trials). The techni -\ncal phrase is that such courts have ‘an appellate function’. Certain criteria have to be met otherwise there can be no appeal and leave to appeal must be sought from the courts, again with criteria determining which court must be approached. Again in practice, whilst a court may predominately hear trials, it may have a limited jurisdiction in relation to appeals, and vice versa. \nGeneric terms applied to courts \nThere are a range of different terms used to refer to courts and one court can qualify for several such descriptions: they are not mutually exclusive. It can be most confusing at \n13 The Right Honourable Sir Robert Auld A Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales . \n14 Tribunals are briefy discussed later in this chapter. \n\n--- Page 69 ---\n   \n   38 DOMESTIC CASE LAW \nTABLE 2.2 RANGE OF REFERENCES TO ROLE/HIERARCHY OF COURT \nReference to \ncourt Explanation of reference \nInferior court These courts have limited jurisdiction, either geographic or fnancial \nSuperior court These courts have unlimited jurisdiction, both geographic and fnancial \nTrial court The court where a dispute is heard for the frst time; these are also known as frst instance courts (because logically it is the frst time the matter has gone to the court) \nAppellate court Hearing an appeal from a trial court or a subordinate appeal court.

Courts are either predominantly superior (senior) or inferior (subordinate) courts, and will mainly exercise appellate or trial functions. \nAppellate courts \nThe judges in the appeal courts are the most senior judges in the UK. The appeals in the senior appellate courts are conducted by legal argument and the submission of docu -\nmentary evidence. No witnesses are called. Appeals are not automatically allowed and a party wishing to appeal the decision of a court usually has to seek ‘leave to appeal’. A brief description of the senior appellate courts is given below. At the end of these descrip -\ntions, Table 2 .3 briefy sets out the main features of each court for your quick reference. \nThe Supreme Court of the UK (SCUK) \nThe Supreme Court is the fnal court of appeal for all criminal and civil cases in the English legal system (England, Wales and Northern Ireland).

Its jurisdiction covers the United Kingdom. \nIt was established by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 and commenced hearing \ncases on 1 October 2009. It inherited the jurisdiction of the House of Lords, which was the former fnal court of appeal. \nCurrently, there are 12 ‘Justices of the Supreme Court’. These include the President of \nthe Supreme Court and the Deputy President of the Supreme Court. The court sits in its own dedicated building in Parliament Square, London. \nThe Court of Appeal (EWCA) \nThe Court of Appeal is divided into two divisions, the criminal appeal division and the civil appeals division. Its jurisdiction extends to England and Wales, but not to the entire United Kingdom in the way that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court extends. \nIt is staffed by Lord/Lady Justices of Appeal. Normally three Justices of Appeal sit in \ncourt. For important cases it is possible for fve or seven Justices of Appeal to sit in court. In rare circumstances the court can sit with one judge. \nAppeal Court: criminal division \nThe head of the criminal appeals division is the Lord Chief Justice. \nThe criminal appeals division hears appeals against convictions and sentences from \ndefendants in the Crown Court. It also hears references from the Attorney General on a point of law or on the grounds of an unduly lenient sentence being given. In cases where there has been an acquittal, the acquittal will stand (Criminal Justice Act 1972, s 36), but a ruling can be given by the court supporting the appeal and this must be taken into account in further similar cases. Finally, it has jurisdiction to hear references by the Criminal Cases Review Commission concerning a potential miscarriage of justice.\n15 \nAs noted above, there is not an automatic right to appeal and the Court of Appeal also \nhears applications for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. \nAppeal Court: civil division \nThe Master of the Rolls is the head of the civil division, which deals with appeals from the High Court and the county court. It also has jurisdiction to hear appeals from the Upper Tribunal, Employment Appeal Tribunal, Immigration Appeal Tribunal, Lands Tribunal and the Social Security Commissioners. Tribunals are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Table 2 .3 sets out the appellate courts in a quick access table form. \nSuperior courts \nA superior court is one whose decisions are not subject to any other court except an appellate court. These courts deal with trials and are also called courts of frst instance. Some of these courts are more closely identifed with criminal law and some with civil law cases. Most courts will major in one area of jurisdiction, but exercise limited jurisdiction \n15 s 9 Criminal Appeal Act 1995. \n\n--- Page 72 ---\n      \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n  DOMESTIC CASE LAW 41 TABLE 2.4 SUPERIOR COURTS: HIGH COURT AND CROWN COURT: ROLE, JUDGES, DIVISIONS AND JURISDICTION\nDescription of court Judges Inferior\ncourt Superiorcourt Criminaljurisdiction Civiljurisdiction Trialcourt Appellatecourt \nTheHighCourt Queen’sBenchDivision First instance jurisdiction: Appellate jurisdiction:criminal appeals from magistrates’ court, CrownCourt sitting without a jury.

At the end of the descriptions, Table 2 .5 briefy sets out the main features of \neach court for your quick reference. \nThe High Court \nThe High Court is split into three divisions for administrative purposes: Queen’s Bench \nDivision, Chancery Division, Family Division and each of these three divisions is further subdivided. Its primary jurisdiction is civil at frst instance, but it also has an appellate jurisdiction in a limited range of criminal and civil matters. \nThe judges sitting in the High Court are referred to as ‘ puisne ’ judges, a word derived \nfrom the old French for ‘inferior’. \nQueen’s Bench Division \nThe head of the division is the Lord Chief Justice. Its jurisdiction is primarily civil. However, alongside its civil jurisdiction it exercises an appellate jurisdiction to hear criminal appeals from the magistrates’ court by way of ‘case stated’. No witnesses are called, and the appeal is conducted by legal argument and the submission of documentary evidence. It also has jurisdiction to hear criminal appeals from the Crown Court, which has sat without a jury. \nThe Queen’s Bench Division mainly deals with civil actions in contract and tort (acci -\ndent) claims, fraud, malicious prosecution, claims against the police and contentious pro -\nbate cases. Additionally, it has the jurisdiction to hear civil appeals from the county courts. \nThe sub-divisional courts of the Queen’s Bench Division \nTo more effciently carry out its range of functions, it also has fve specialist sub-divisional courts, the Administrative Court, the Admiralty Court, the Commercial Court, the Technology and Construction Court and the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court. The Administrative Court deals with applications for judicial review. This is an application to review the action of a public or a private body (e.g. a local authority or a sports club), mostly on the grounds that in exercising its public duties and making a determination that body has exceeded its lawful authority. As you may suspect, the Admiralty Court deals exclusively with matters relating to shipping, although it also deals with issues relating to aircraft. The Commercial Court deals with actions arising in the felds of banking, insurance and fnance. The Technology and Construction Court deals with disputes about engeneering, building and surveying. The Intellectual Property Enterproise Court deals with diputes concerning intellectual prop -\nerty, including patents, copyright and registered designs and trademarks. \nThe Chancery Division of the High Court \nThe head of the Chancery Division is the Chancellor of the High Court. Its jurisdiction is exclusively civil. It is mostly concerned with civil trials in the areas of wills, estates, con -\ntentious probate, land and mortgage actions, trusts, company law, intellectual property and partnerships. It also hears appeals from the county court concerning issues such as bankruptcy. Like the Queen’s Bench Division, the Chancery Division has specialist sub-divisional courts. The Patents Court deals with ownership of products, and the Court of Protection is concerned with the rights of persons with a disability. \n\n--- Page 75 ---\n     \n     \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 44 DOMESTIC CASE LAW \nTABLE 2.5 INFERIOR COURTS: COUNTY COURT AND MAGISTRATES’ COURT: ROLE, JUDGES AND JURISDICTION\nDescription Inferior\ncourt Superiorcourt Criminaljurisdiction Civiljurisdiction Trial court (f rst instance) Appellatecourt \nCounty court \nFirst instance jurisdiction: debt, personal injuries compensation,breach of contract relating to goods/property, divorce, adoption, wills, bankruptcy, housing disputes \nincluding mortgages, arrears of rent, repossessions There are geographical \nas well as f nancial limits on its jurisdiction Track system: \nSmall claims, fast track, multi-track \n170 county courts Judges: circuitjudges, deputycircuit judges,district judges,part-time deputy districtjudges √ X √ √ √ X \nMagistrates’court Deals with the majority of all criminal matters (90 per cent); all start in the court: bail applications, warrants for arrest or search, Youth courts, trial criminal: summary offences Trial civil recovery of civil debt, highways issues, family matters excluding divorce, care proceedings linked to children in Youth court Heard by Justices of the Peace who are lay magistrates, sitting as three or a single district judgeworking full-time salaried √ X √ √ √ X \n\n--- Page 76 ---\n    DOMESTIC CASE LAW 45 \nThe Family Division of the High Court \nThe head of division is the President of the Family Division. Its main jurisdiction is civil \nhearing trials relating to defended divorce, adoption and wardship. It exercises limited criminal jurisdiction. If a domestic violence issue is clearly connected to the issue of the settlement of family property, wills and probate, it has jurisdiction to hear the domestic violence issue. It also has a criminal appellate jurisdiction to hear appeals from magis -\ntrates’ courts and the Crown Court in family issues. \nThe Crown Court \nThe jurisdiction of the Crown Court is mainly criminal. It hears criminal trials on indictment heard by a jury, trials where the magistrates declined jurisdiction and trials of offences that can be heard by either the magistrates’ court or Crown Court by the defendant’s choice. \nIt also deals with referrals for sentencing from magistrates’ courts where the statutory \nlimit is considered inadequate and they seek a higher sentence. \nThe Crown Court exercises an appellate jurisdiction in the area of appeals against \nsentences imposed in the magistrates’ court and appeals against conviction in the mag -\nistrates’ court. It also exercises a very limited civil jurisdiction in relation to highways repair and other small matters. \nIt is staffed by High Court judges, circuit judges, deputy circuit judges (part-time), \nrecorders (part-time) and assistant recorders (part-time). \nInferior courts \nThis term basically means that the decisions of these courts are prone to being over -\nturned by the superior courts. \nThe County Court \nCurrently, there are 170 county courts that deal with the majority of civil disputes in the areas of debt, personal injuries compensation, breach of contract relating to goods/prop -\nerty, divorce, adoption, wills, bankruptcy, housing disputes, including mortgages, arrears of rent and repossessions. \nThere are geographical as well as fnancial limits on its jurisdiction. For the purposes of \nadministrative effciency, the court operates a track system. The normal track deals with small claims, mostly under £10,000, although there are a few exceptions. The fast track deals with claims that are under £25,000. The multi-track system deals with complex claims over £25,000. \nThe judges in the county court are circuit judges, deputy circuit judges, district judges \nand part-time deputy district judges. \n\n--- Page 77 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n   46 DOMESTIC CASE LAW \nThe Magistrates’ Court \nThis court deals with nearly all criminal matters as the majority of criminal prosecutions \nmust start in the magistrates’ court. A number are then sent on to the Crown Court for trial. The magistrates’ court also exercises criminal jurisdiction to hear bail applications, warrants for arrest or search, and summary offences. It also runs ‘Youth courts’ dealing with young offenders. \nIt also has civil jurisdiction in the area of recovery of civil debt, highways issues, family \nmatters (excluding divorce) and care proceedings linked to children in Youth court. \nIts primary judges are the Justices of the Peace, who are lay magistrates, sitting on a \nbench of three, who are unpaid and part-time. There is provision for some to be appointed as stipendiary magistrates, and then a modest payment is received. The court is also staffed by salaried district judges working full time. \nTribunals \nTribunals were created by legislation in the twentieth century to primarily deal with dis -\nputes by individuals against the state (including government agencies) in particular, in areas such as employment, rents, immigration, mental health and taxations. They are part of the administrative justice stream of the English legal system as their role is to review decision making. The tribunal system developed piecemeal from the 1950s and was restructured by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (TCEA 2007).\n16 \nThe TCEA 2007 creates a two-tier system to include most tribunals and is geared \nonly to appeals against decision making by state offcials. The First-Tier Tribunal is divided into chambers similar to the idea of courts in the courts system, each one hear -\ning cases in particular areas. The Act also creates an Upper Tier Tribunal, which mainly exercises review and appellate functions but has a limited frst instance hearing role in other areas. It is a superior court of record. Its decisions are therefore binding on First-Tier Tribunals. \nIn 2011 the administration of the tribunals was merged with the administration of the \ncourts, creating Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service. Some tribunals are noticeably left out of the restructuring, for example, the Employment Tribunal and the Employment Appeals Tribunal. \nPanels of members decide the outcome of cases in the upper and frst tiers and for \ntribunals outside the tier system. These ‘members’ can be legally qualifed in which case they are called a judge; additionally, judges in the High Court and other courts can sit as a member. Panel members also include experts in the area, for example, doctors or survey -\nors. A judge may sit alone when deciding a case. Each panel has a tribunal chairman or, if a judge is sitting, a tribunal judge responsible for communicating the decision in writing. The Senior President of Tribunals heads up the tier system. \nIt is possible to appeal to the Court of Appeal and on to the Supreme Court from the \nUpper Tribunal, which can also refer some cases to the High Court. \n16 This followed on from the Leggatt Report Tribunals for Users: One System, One Service (2001) www.tribu -\nnals-review.org.uk, accessed 2 October 2020. \n\n--- Page 78 ---\n    \n DOMESTIC CASE LAW 47 \nA notable example of an important tribunal outside the tier system is the Employment \nTribunal and the Employment Appeals Tribunal. Appeals can also go to the Court of \nAppeal and Supreme Court from Appeals Tribunals outside the tier system. This is illus -\ntrated in Figure 2 .1. Table 2 .6 gives information in a checklist format for your use. \nCourts outside the hierarchical system of the English legal system \nTwo courts exert an impact on the English legal system because their decisions can form persuasive precedents or because the statute has provided that their decisions should be taken into account in areas of relevance. The two courts falling into this category are: \n  The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (PC). \n  The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). \nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council \nThe Privy Council is composed of around 500 Privy Counsellors whose duty is to give \nadvice to the monarch concerning the discharge of their state duties. Counsellors have attained high public offce. All past cabinet members, party leaders, archbishops, and current or past speakers of the House of Commons are automatically Privy Counsellors. The ministerial head of the Privy Council is its Senior President. Several committees oper -\nate in the council, and one of them is the Judicial Committee. \nThis is the fnal court of appeal for UK overseas territories, Crown dependencies, \nmilitary sovereign bases overseas, ancient courts (prize courts, Court of Admiralty of the Cinque Ports) and ecclesiastical courts (Arches Court of Canterbury, the Chancery Court of York, Church Commissioners) and for those Commonwealth countries who have retained the court. A court normally consists of three or fve judges. It shares the Supreme Court building in London. Table 2 .7 below sets out checklist information. \nJustices of the UK Supreme Court can sit (as can former Lords of Appeal in Ordinary) \nas well as Privy Counsellors who are judges in superior courts in the Commonwealth. \nThe decisions of the Judicial Committee are considered to be persuasive precedents \nwithin the English legal system, but they do not have to be followed. \nThe European Court of Human Rights \nECtHR \nThis is a court established by the Council of Europe (CoE) in 1959 as a court to hear claims by individuals who had exhausted all of the avenues of complaint nationally available in relation to the European Convention on Human Rights 1950. Revisions to the structure of the CoE in 1998 led to the abolition of the existing ECtHR and the European Commission on Human Rights and the establishing of a new Court of Human Rights. \n\n--- Page 79 ---\n   \n  48 DOMESTIC CASE LAW \nFigure 2.1 UK court structure: also showing its relationship with the tribunals, the Privy Council and the European Court of Human Rights \n\n--- Page 80 ---\n      \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n     DOMESTIC CASE LAW 49 TABLE 2.6 TRIBUNALS TIER SYSTEM: ROLE, ADJUDICATORS AND JURISDICTION\nDescription Panel First instancehearing Appeal hearings Superiorcourt of record \nFirst-TierTribunal\na The First-Tier Tribunal is divided into specialist chambers, and chambers can be added as required.

The enactment of the \nHuman Rights Act by Parliament in 1998 changed the domestic judges’ relationship with \nthe ECtHR. This Act allowed nationals to bring claims relating to alleged breaches of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in domestic courts. Individuals must have exhausted all of the avenues of complaint nationally available in relation to the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 before being able to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Section 2 of the Act places a duty on all English judges to take into account the case law of the European Court of Human Rights when deciding cases where they have been given jurisdiction by the Act. More information on this court will follow in  Chapter 4. \nThe hierarchy of the domestic courts (with reference to \ntribunals and the European Court of Human Rights) \nIn the English legal system all courts have a determined place in a hierarchy of courts. It \nis extremely important to know and understand the basic framework for the hierarchy of courts as it provides a framework for understanding the doctrine of precedent. Figure 2 .1 \nsets out a diagram of the court structure of the English legal system indicating the hier -\narchy of courts. An arrow pointing from one court to another denotes that the court the arrow points to holds a higher position in the hierarchy and exercises an appellate func -\ntion over the decisions of the court below it. The most senior court is the Supreme Court. \nThe hierarchy of the courts is key in maintaining the doctrine of precedent, which \nstates that the decisions of senior courts bind those below it and themselves in similar cases. The Supreme Court is an exception in that it is not bound by any court in terms of precedent and it is not bound by itself. \nWhilst the diagram deals with the simple issue of hierarchy, do note that there are \nsmall appellate functions held by trial courts which will have been referred to above in the descriptions of each court. In addition it is possible for an appellant to bypass the Court of Appeal (through a process known as ‘leap-frogging’) and take their appeal directly to the Supreme Court if the appeal fulfls certain criteria. \nThe diagram also refers to two courts that we have already described above, the Privy \nCouncil shown in a grey box and the European Court of Human Rights shown in a blue box. Taken together, these two courts have slightly anomalous positions because they are not part of the hierarchy of the English legal system court structure, yet they are rel -\nevant courts, and their decisions do have a bearing on the way in which English courts determine legal issues dealing with the same legal rules. Often these two courts are a source of confusion because students are not sure where they ft. This diagram clearly explains and shows the nature of their relationship to the English court structure.\n17 \nAdditionally, the diagram refers to the English tribunal system in a grey box. The place \nof tribunals in the English legal system can also be a source of confusion; students want to know how and where tribunals ‘ft’. The legislation setting up many tribunals, but not all, allows an appeal to the main two appellate courts in the English court structure (the Court of Appeal civil division and the Supreme Court).\n18 This can only be done after the \n17 The ECtHR is considered in more detail in Chapter 4 . \n18 The Privy Council is considered in more detail in Chapter 8 . \n\n--- Page 83 ---\n   52 DOMESTIC CASE LAW \nappeals process with the tribunal system has been exhausted. That is why it is important \nto include tribunals in the Figure 2 .1 diagram. \nCONCLUSION \nIn this chapter, you have learnt about the creation and development of both common law and equity and their interrelationship within the English legal system. The develop -\nment of case law through the decisions of senior judges in the English courts has been a piecemeal process, and so too the creation of a court structure, which through periodi -\ncal reform now has a logical hierarchy, operating administratively alongside the system of tribunals. The jurisdiction, nature, and function of the court system within the English legal system, including the role and importance of the doctrine of precedent should now be clear. The importance of three courts outside the hierarchy of the courts, the Privy Council, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights, should also be evident. \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  The English legal system is a common law system. \n  Case law is the law created by judges deciding disputes in court. \n  As the common law (also initially referred to as royal justice) developed it got rid of other competing dispute resolution methods such as blood feud, trial by battle and trial by ordeal. \n  Equity was developed as a separate system of law administered by the chancery courts to deal with the rigidity of the common law and its lack of remedies beyond monetary damages. \n  The Supreme Court of Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 declared that courts could dispense both common law and equitable principles and that equity prevailed over common law. \n  A customary rule is a practice that communities agree is the only right way to act in that matter; they can change from generation to generation and between geographic areas. \n  Over time customary rules became part of the common law. \n  The English common law system relies on a strict following of the doctrine of precedent. \n  Courts of law are the institutions that hear and determine legal disputes. \n  English courts are in a hierarchical relationship which is pivotal to the operation of the doctrine of precedent. \n  Criminal courts hear cases brought by the state against an individual and they dis -\npense punishment. \n\n--- Page 84 ---\n    DOMESTIC CASE LAW 53 \n  The frst major overhaul of the structure (as well as the administration) of English civil \ncourts occurred in the nineteenth century through the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875. \n  The frst major overhaul of criminal courts occurred in the Courts Act 1975, which also established the Crown Court. \n  The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 established the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. \n  The Courts Act 2003 unifed the administration of the English courts and set up a new institution, Her Majesty’s Courts Service. \n  In 2011 the tribunal system was merged into HMCS, creating Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service. HMCTS does not include the Supreme Court. \n  Tribunals are created by statute, only have statutory jurisdiction and have only been in existence since the mid-twentieth century. Tribunals were administratively reor -\nganised by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and merged with HMC Service in 2011 to form Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service. \n  The Privy Council is the highest appeal court for UK dominions and territories. \n\n--- Page 86 ---\n3 \n  \n INTERNATIONAL AND \nEUROPEAN LAW \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Understand what a treaty is. \n  Appreciate that a treaty operates at the level of international law with no legal effect \nwithin the English legal system unless domestic legislation gives it legal effect. \n  Understand how some or all obligations in a treaty can also become part of English law. \n  Be able to competently read, use and understand treaties. \n  Understand the basic structure of the European Union and its major sources of law. \n  Understand what implications European Law has on the UK even after Brexit. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-4  \n\n--- Page 87 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n        56 INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW \nINTRODUCTION \nBesides the laws made by the legislators of a country (in the UK, Parliament), there is \nanother area of law that concerns states, corporations and individuals: international law. \nThis area is usually divided into two different topics: \n  Public international law: the study of specifc laws that bind states and individuals, mostly through treaties. \n  Private international law (also called ‘confict of laws’): the study how different national legal systems interact – what happens, for example, if a Russian and an Argentinian got married in South Africa and want a divorce in the United States, or which courts decide a dispute between a Moroccan buyer and a Danish seller, and under which law. \nWhen studying law, you will typically not have to deal with the complications of private international law (maybe in an elective module like International Trade Law, but even there in a simplifed version). Public international law, however, is something you will encounter regularly, and not only in elective modules: treaties and international organisations have regularly shaped and infuenced the British legal systems. \nThis chapter is supposed to help you understand the basic concepts that you need to \nunderstand these interactions. \nEuropean Union law is technically public international law as well – the European Union \n(EU) and its predecessors were created by treaties, but over time it has developed into a whole different area of law. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) refers to a ‘new legal order’  of international law.\n1 Through the treaties, through a very wide body of sec -\nondary legislation by the EU institutions, and through the jurisdiction of the CJEU, EU law now is to a large extent directly applicable and effective within each of its member states. \nEven though the United Kingdom left the European Union at midnight on 31 January \n2020, and the transition period ended on 31 December 2020, EU law still has an important infuence on the laws of the United Kingdom, so this chapter will also provide an introduc -\ntion into that area of law. \nINTERNATIONAL LAW \nWhat is a treaty? \nFormally speaking, a treaty is an agreement between two or more states and/or interna -\ntional organisations. Essentially a contract at the state level. Treaties are usually written documents, but the most important defnition of treaties in the Vienna Declaration on the Law of Treaties 1969 (VCLT) – itself a treaty (i.e. a treaty about treaties) – explicitly states that unwritten agreements can also be treaties (Article 3). \n1 C ase 26/62 NV Algemene Transport – en Expeditie Onderneming van Gend & Loos v Netherlands Inland \nRevenue Administration  [1963] ECR 1. \n\n--- Page 88 ---\n    \n INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW 57 \nYou might encounter plenty of other words that mean more or less the same thing as \n‘treaty’: convention, charter, covenant, pact, act, statute, concordat (a treaty that involves \nthe Holy See) or protocol (a treaty that modifes another treaty). All of these mean an agreement between states that all participating states agree to be legally bound by. \nHow do states agree to treaties? \nDrafting \nBefore anyone agrees to a treaty, it will need to be written frst. This stage is usually done behind closed doors by diplomats and lawyers of the countries taking part. As you can imagine, this stage is dominated by politics, power differences between the parties and bargaining/negotiation. Many other factors – internal politics within the states, media coverage, lobbyism, activism, or in some cases bribery, can all infuence this stage. Depending on the complexity of the treaty, this can be a very long process. We will look at drafting skills in Chapter 16 . \nSignature \nOnce the terms of a document are agreed upon, it will be opened for signature. Often, this is done by the Head of State/Government or the Foreign Minister in a ceremony, but it could also be someone else authorised to do this on behalf of their government. \nEven though this act is often the moment the public will see from the creation of the \nnew treaty, it does not by itself create legal obligations for the states signing, besides a rather vague obligation not to work actively against the objectives of the treaty. \nRatifcation \nMore important from a legal standpoint is ratifcation. This means that the signing govern -\nment will need to get formal approval at home for committing to the treaty. How exactly this is done depends on the constitution of the country. Some countries, like Ireland or Switzerland, require a referendum on an important treaty; others, like the UK, require approval by Parliament. Other states might just require formal government approval. In any case, ratifcation means defnite consent to the treaty. \nEffectiveness of the Treaty \nDepending on what is agreed in the treaty, it can then still take a while before the treaty comes into effect – the date could be fxed in the treaty, or it could be stipulated that the treaty only comes into effect once a certain number of state parties have ratifed the treaty. If no date is given, the treaty comes into effect for a Member State once the ratif -\ncation is complete. \n\n--- Page 89 ---\n   \n                       \n        \n 58 INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW \nThis process is worth keeping in mind when you come across different dates in differ -\nent textbooks – the Treaty of Rome that established the European Economic Community, \nfor example, was signed in 1957, but only came into effect in 1958. In this book, we shall give the latter date, but other authors have decided differently. \nReservations \nThere is, however, one caveat. States can (and very often do) explain that certain parts of the treaty do not apply to them. This is called a reservation, and is legally quite complex. Unless a treaty explicitly prohibits reservations (see, for example, Article 120 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court), this is allowed as long as the reservation does not go against the object and purpose of a treaty (Article 19 [c] VCLT). \nThe reason for allowing reservations is to maximise participation, but this is often a \nmatter of academic and activist discussion. A good example here is the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) 1979. The United Nations (UN) is quite proud of the fact that CEDAW is one of the most widely ratifed human rights treaties in the world, but sadly it also carries a long list of reservations with it.\n2 A lot of these are clarifcations intended for domestic audiences or concern relatively \nminor issues that even progressive voices can tolerate for the greater good of ratifcation. The UK, for example, made a reservation to retain its discriminatory rules of succession to the Throne (at the time of ratifcation, the rule was that the oldest male heir of the mon -\narch would inherit the title), other states clarifed that the ratifcation of CEDAW will not affect their rules on family names after marriage. \nOther reservations, on the other hand, are more problematic – Saudi Arabia made a \nreservation stating that ‘In case of contradiction between any term of the Convention and norms of Islamic law, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not under obligation to observe the contradictory terms of the Convention’.\n3 This means that CEDAW does not really have \nany relevance in Saudi Arabia unless it complies with Islamic law (as understood and interpreted by the Saudi authorities). \nIt is up to you what you think of this practice and whether it would be better simply \nto exclude a state like Saudi Arabia from the Convention. On the one hand, Saudi Arabia gets a fg leaf to cover up its highly problematic women’s rights record and can claim to be a party to CEDAW. On the other hand, the state would have never agreed to ratify the Convention without a reservation like this, and women’s rights activists and campaigners in Saudi Arabia now have at least something to refer to. \nWhat does a treaty look like? \nWhile there are no formal rules on how a treaty should look, it is now customary that trea -\nties begin with a preamble. This part does not set out legal obligations, but gives a short summary of the aims of the treaty. Typically, this is done in one very long sentence over several paragraphs. The preamble is quite helpful for understanding the intentions of the drafters of the treaty and can be used for the interpretation of the actual content. \n2 T he full list of reservations by country can be seen here: http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open \n&DS=CEDAW/SP/2006/2&Lang=E. \n3 Ibid., 25. \n\n--- Page 90 ---\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW 59 \nThe actual obligations of the parties are laid out in the main body of the treaty in con -\nsecutively numbered articles that often have sub-paragraphs. The treaty itself is (depend -\ning on its length) usually divided into numbered sections or chapters. If you are discussing \nthe legal aspects, you will only need to refer to the number of the article. \nLater changes to a treaty \nIf the member states to a treaty later decide to make changes to a treaty, this is usually done with another treaty. If all member states agree, they can simply make a modifcation treaty that lists all the changes to be made to the initial treaty, and the ‘consolidated version’ of the treaty will show the current version, including all changes to date. Most famously, this has been done multiple times in the European Union: the latest treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon (2007) made changes to the Treaty of Maastricht and to the Treaty of Rome. \nIf some, but not all, member states decide to go further on some aspects of a treaty, \nthey can add what is usually called ‘Additional Protocols’ to the original treaty. This is the case with the European Convention on Human Rights: the original Convention is from 1953, and does not contain all rights that progressive states in 2020 would consider rel -\nevant, so there have been 16 Additional Protocols to date. \nAn example is the death penalty within the member states of the European Convention \non Human Rights. In 1953, this practice was still widespread within Europe, and the right to life in Article 2 explicitly allows ‘the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law’ as an exception to the right of life. Over time, more and more member states have changed their position on the issue, and adopted Additional Protocol No. 6 (which restricted the death penalty to times of war) and later Additional Protocol No. 13 (which completely rules out the death penalty in all cases). \nThis position changed over time in many member states (by now in all but three), but \nnot all member states would have accepted a change to the Convention itself. Therefore, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia can be member states of the ECHR but do not have to rule out the death penalty. \nWhat happens if a state breaks a treaty? \nThis seems to be the most important question given what we regularly hear in the news: states seem to break international law constantly. However, in reality, this is not as big an issue as one might think. In the famous words of international lawyer Louis Henkin, ‘[i]t is probably the case that almost all nations observe almost all principles of international law and almost all of their obligations almost all of the time’.\n4 \nWhat actually happens if a state breaks a treaty is not very straightforward. There are \nmajor differences between national and international law. There is no world legislator – states are sovereign and can (mostly) choose themselves which laws they are bound by and which not, there is no world court with binding jurisdiction (the International Court of Justice works very differently, see below), and there is no world police to enforce treaties or judgments of international courts. \n4 L Henkin, How Nations Behave (2nd edition, Columbia University Press, New York, 1979), 47. \n\n--- Page 91 ---\n   \n 60 INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW \nIn many cases, the treaties themselves stipulate sanctions. States often have agreed \nthemselves that if they fail to fulfl their obligations they will pay penalties to the other \nstates. As painful as that may be in some cases, it was probably of importance for the state that the other states fulfl their part. In other cases, treaties give jurisdictions to international courts – to special courts set up by the treaty or to the International Court of Justice. However, if none of this is in the treaty, or if a state completely ignores this part as well, there are no legal means of coercion, and we enter the realm of the political. States or international organisations (like the United Nations) might impose sanctions, but this depends on a large number of factors that have little to do with legal obligations: power differences, allies with veto power on the Security Council of the UN, the economic situ -\nation, etc. Other punishments for breaking a treaty can include countermeasures (if state A does not fulfl its part of the treaty, state B might hold back on its own part as well) or declaring the ambassador of the wrongful state a persona non grata , i.e. giving them time \nto leave the country. \nCustomary international law \nBesides treaties, there is another set of rules that bind states: customary international law. You are less likely to come across this outside of elective modules on international law, but it is good to know that this exists. \nCustomary international law is a set of unwritten rules that are formed when two ele -\nments come together: (a) state practice: states have been doing something for quite a while and (b) opinio juris : states have been doing that because they believed they had an \nobligation to do so. All states are presumed to be bound by rules of customary interna -\ntional law unless they persistently objected to the rule while it was formed. \nAll of this is quite vague – there are no rules, for example, how many states have to \npractice something for how long, and it is obviously not easy to determine the belief of a state – but it is surprisingly important. Some of the cornerstones of international law as we know it today are customary rules: the immunity of heads of state and diplomats or the prohibition of slavery, torture and genocide are all rooted within customary international law. This means that even if a state has not, for example, ratifed the Convention against Torture, it is still not allowed to torture its citizens. \nNormally, customary international law can be overridden by a treaty, but some norms \nare regarded as so essential – like the prohibition of torture, slavery or genocide – that they are seen as jus cogens : pre-emptory norms of international law that cannot be \ndisregarded. \nInternational organisations \nLike national law, international law grew in its complexity over time. Early modern interna -\ntional law (often considered to start with Hugo Grotius’ book De iure belli ac paci  (1625)) \nconcerned broad and general agreements between states, but with time international \n\n--- Page 92 ---\n    \n \n INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW 61 \nagreements concerned more and more matters that needed permanent discussions \nbetween the parties involved and structures supporting these discussions. Following examples from private organisations (e.g. the Anti Slavery Union or the International Committee of the Red Cross), states set up organisations to assist them in their tasks (e.g. the International Telegraphic Union and Universal Postal Union in 1874). \nInternational organisations are typically established by a treaty, have a membership \nconsisting of states and/or other international organisations, have a will autonomous from its members, legal personality and the capability to adopt norms addressed to their members.\n5 \nIn today’s complex legal world, their tasks include areas as diverse as creating peace \n(e.g. the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe or the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), organising the collective defence of member states (e.g. the North Atlantic Treaty Organization), controlling nuclear weapons and power (International Atomic Energy Agency), or controlling trade and fnances (e.g. the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank). International organisations can be worldwide endeavours (e.g. the Universal Postal Union) or regional (e.g. the African Union or the British-Irish Council), and they can be universal (e.g. the United Nations) or highly specialised (e.g. the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan). \nThe UN takes a central place among international organisations. Due to its near-uni -\nversal membership (193 states) and its wide-ranging powers, it is sometimes (wrongly) compared to a world government. All member states of the UN agree that the UN Charter (the treaty establishing the UN) overrides other obligations the state might have (Article 103 Charter of the United Nations) and, even more importantly, to ‘accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council’ (Article 25 Charter of the UN), the main decision-making body of the UN. The Security Council consists of 15 member states, 10 of which get elected by the other body of the UN, the General Assembly, and 5 of which (US, UK, France, Russia, China) are permanently represented. \nAccording to the Article 2 (4) UN Charter, member states are prohibited from threaten -\ning with or using force against other states, and the only accepted exceptions are self -\ndefence (Article 51 Charter of the United Nations) or a decision by the Security Council (Article 42 Charter of the United Nations). \nThe International Court of Justice \nThe Court \nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ), the successor of the Permanent Court of International Justice, sits in The Hague in the Netherlands. It is an organ of the United Nations, in fact the only principal organ that is not located in New York City. It con -\nsists of 15 judges elected by the UN General Assembly (usually including one judge per \n5 P Sands and P Klein, Bowett’s Law of International Institutions (Sweet & Maxwell 2009), 15. \n\n--- Page 93 ---\n   \n  \n    \n  \n      \n \n \n 62 INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW \npermanent member of the Security Council, although this unwritten understanding seems \nto have changed when recently the UK candidate failed to be elected). Judges tend to be either high ranking judges from their country of origin, well-known professors of interna -\ntional law or high ranking diplomats, and they tend to be male: in over 70 years, only four judges have been women, with the frst one – Rosalyn Higgins – joining the Court in 1995. \nContentious cases \nBy national standards, this is a very strange court in many ways. While it is often called ‘the world court’ in the media, it has a relatively limited mandate and only deals with a very small number of cases: in some years it might only give one single judgment or advi -\nsory opinion. States in international law are sovereign, which means that they are only bound by treaties and judgments they have agreed to. This means that no state has to appear at the ICJ. \nThe ICJ will only decide a contentious case if … \n1. Both parties have agreed to bring the case to the Court, either after the dispute arose or in the treaty the dispute is about \n2. One party brings the dispute to the Court and the other party then agrees to the jurisdiction (called forum prorogatum ) \n3. Both parties have previously made a declaration that they accept compulsory juris -\ndiction of the ICJ, which they can always withdraw. Currently, 73 states have made such a declaration, including the UK.\n6 \nOnce that is the case, the judgments of the ICJ are binding and can be enforced by the Security Council (Article 94 of the Charter of the United Nations [UNC]). However, you need to keep in mind that in addition to ten elected members, the Security Council has fve permanent members who can block any decision (the so-called veto power, Article 27 [3] UNC). This means that even the best judgment of the Court is not going to help you if, say, you are Nicaragua in 1986 and your opponent is the United States,\n7 but in almost \nall cases the political pressure that follows from an ICJ judgment will be enough to com -\npel a state to comply. \nAdvisory opinions \nThe Court can also give advisory opinions on important topics when asked to do so by the Security Council, the General Assembly and other international organisations. These quite often concern questions that are very contentious – see the opinions on the legality of nuclear weapons,\n8 the Palestinian Wall,9 or more recently on the UK’s mistreatment of \n6 T he list is available on the website of the Court: https://www.icj-cij.org/en/declarations. \n7 S ee Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v.

Advisory opinions can \nbe important as a political argument or as support for activism, but states can lawfully \ndecide to ignore them, as the Palestinians11 or the West Saharis12 found out (both advisory \nopinions have been largely ignored by the relevant states). \nWhat is the legal effect of a treaty in the country? \nWhile a lot of treaties only set out rules that concern governments in their relations with each other, some treaties actually give rights and obligations to individuals. The most important example are human right treaties, but other treaties could be important as well (for example, trade agreements affecting corporations operating across borders). \nIn how far individuals can rely on a treaty in a court depends not only on the treaty but \nalso on the country’s constitution. In theory, there are two positions: \nMonism \nMonism assumes that treaties that a state has signed and ratifed are part of the state’s legal system. International law in monist theory is basically another area of law, just like criminal law or family law, and as long as a treaty gives suffcient rights or obligations to individuals, these can be enforced within the state’s court system. \nDualism \nDualism, on the other hand, assumes that there are two very distinct areas of law for a state. Inside the state, national law is enacted by the national legislature and enforced by the courts. Outside the state, the state itself has international legal obligations towards other states. In order for a treaty to have an effect within a state, the state’s legislature will need to implement the treaty into national law frst. \nThe reality \nThe two poles of monism and dualism are often portrayed as absolutes, but in reality almost all states are somewhere in between the two. Switzerland is often used as an example of a very monist state,\n13 while the UK is often seen as an example of a dualist \nstate. However, English courts do generally accept customary international law as part of the law of the land.\n14 Treaties, however, need to be implemented into domestic law by \nmeans of legislation in order to be used by English and Welsh courts.15 \nThe implementation Act could simply transfer the entire treaty into domestic law, but \nit could also only implement parts or change aspects of the treaty for domestic courts. \n10 Legal Consequences of the Separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965 , Advisory \nOpinion, International Court of Justice, 25 February 2019. \n11 See note 9 above. \n12 Western Sahara , Advisory Opinion, I.C.J.

More and more of this concerns individuals as well. However, before you attempt to use an international treaty in a domestic court, you need to check a few things: \n1. Is the UK a member of the treaty – i.e. has it signed and ratifed the treaty/the addi -\ntional protocol in question? \n2. Is the treaty already in effect? \n3. Has the UK made a (valid) reservation that concerns the article you want to apply? \n4. Has the treaty been incorporated by Parliament? Does the incorporation include the \nrelevant article? \nEUROPEAN UNION LAW \nWhat is the European Union? \nThe EU is a supranational international organisation based on a number of international treaties between its member states. Since the United Kingdom left the EU at midnight of 31 January 2020, the EU consists of 27 member states with over 440 million citizens. \n\n--- Page 96 ---\n    \n \n \n INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW 65 \nAt its core, the EU is an economic project that has aimed from its very beginning in \n1958 to establish a common market. It would be wrong, however, to reduce the EU or its \npredecessors to nothing but an economic organisation – one of its goals has always been to create peace in Europe – something we take for granted in today’s world, but that has only ever existed for very short phases in the history of the continent. \nThere are many trading arrangements in the world, for example, the United States– \nMexico–Canada Agreement (formerly known as NAFTA), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area or the Common Market of Eastern and Southern Africa, but none of them has reached the level of integration that the European Union has. \nHow did the European Union develop? \nAfter the end of the Second World War, the political leaders of Western Europe had a number of issues to solve: the continent was devastated by war, the economies were in collapse, the possibility of another war should be eliminated, and the Soviet Union was looming over Western Europe as the new threat. \nThe approach chosen to address these issues was to establish the European Coal \nand Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951, with the aim of pooling the resources needed for war and economic growth (at least in the 1950s). The ECSC was an important step in the history of the continent, but has no signifcance today, as it ended in 1951. \nAs the next step, the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy \nCommunity then followed 1958 with the Treaties of Rome (signed in 1957), two treaties signed and ratifed by France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, (West) Germany and Italy. The European Economic Community (EEC) then went through some changes in the form of further treaties: the Merger Treaty in 1967 and the Single European Act in 1987 (which despite the misleading name ‘Act’ is also a treaty). \nThe progress made in the Single European Act (like the introduction of majority vot -\ning) led the member states to take a further step: the founding of the European Union with the Treaty of Maastricht (or Treaty on European Union) in 1993. At the beginning, the European Union was merely a political construct based around the far more power -\nful European Community (which lost its middle ‘E’ with the Treaty of Maastricht), adding enhanced collaboration in Foreign and Security Policy and in matters concerning Justice and Home Affairs. \nFollowing this were two further reform treaties: the Treaty of Amsterdam (1999) and \nthe Treaty of Nice (2003), but neither of these treaties was seen as suffcient to pre -\npare the European Union for the major challenges ahead, particularly the major enlarge -\nment that was supposed to happen in 2004 (ten, predominantly central and eastern European states were about to join the club, followed only three years later by Romania and Bulgaria). \nTherefore, the member states signed another treaty in 2004 – the Treaty Establishing \na Constitution for Europe. This treaty, often simply called the ‘Constitution’, went into the ratifcation stage and failed two referenda in France and in the Netherlands. The \n\n--- Page 97 ---\n   66 INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW \ncompromise then taken by the member states was to negotiate, sign and ratify a more \ntraditional treaty that did not introduce any major challenges: the Treaty of Lisbon (in force in 2009). \nThe Treaty of Lisbon abolished the distinction between the EC and the EU that was \nintroduced with the Treaty of Maastricht. From 2009 onwards, there has only been one organisation: the European Union. To date, this is the latest treaty reforming the European Union, and given its diffcult birth (following the failure of the Constitutional Treaty and a long ratifcation process with two referenda in Ireland and a reluctant Czech President), it is probably fair to say that the member states are not overly eager to start negotiations for a new treaty any time soon. \nWhat are the key institutions of the European Union? \nThe European Council \nThe European Council consists of the Heads of State or Government from all member states of the EU. It meets at least twice every six months and takes the major, overarching decisions: should a state be admitted for membership? What strategic direction should the EU take in the next fve years? What is the EU’s position on major international devel -\nopments like climate change or the refugee crisis? The European Council is therefore obviously important for the development of the EU but has only limited relevance for the creation of EU law. \nSince the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Council elects itself a president for the period \nof 2.5 years. The fact that you might not even know the name of the current president shows that this offce does not hold a lot of power. \nThe Council of the EU \nThe Council of the EU is far more important when it comes to the actual day-to-day law making of the Union. The Council meets in different compositions (currently ten) depend -\ning on the topic to be discussed, and every Member State is represented by the minister who is qualifed to speak on behalf of his or her government on the topic – for example, the Secretary of State for the Environment or the Foreign Minister. \nMeetings on Foreign Affairs are chaired by the EU’s High Representative for Foreign \nAffairs and Security Policy (elected by the European Council), all the other meetings are chaired by the representative of the Member State that currently holds the presidency – this rotates between all states every six months. \nThe European Parliament \nThe European Parliament is directly elected by the citizens of the member states for a fve-year term. The elections in the member states usually follow national party lines, and \n\n--- Page 98 ---\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW 67 \nthe newly elected Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) then form European party \ngroups in the Parliament. \nThe European Commission \nThe European Commission is probably the most famous institution of the EU. It is often compared to a national government, although that comparison is not entirely accurate. The Commission consists of a President, the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, and 25 Commissioners (adding up to 27), who all get proposed by the European Council following the elections to the European Parliament and then get elected by the Parliament. Each Commissioner is responsi -\nble for a particular area (e.g. Agriculture or Competition) and is independent of their national government. \nThe Commission is responsible to the European Parliament and can be forced to \nresign by a vote of censure in the Parliament. This has almost happened once: in 1999, the Santer Commission resigned collectively before the Parliament could pass such a vote. \nThe Court of Justice of the EU \nThe Court of Justice has a central importance for the EU – not just because this is a law textbook. Throughout the history of the EU and its predecessors, the judicial arm of the EU has often been the driving force when member states were reluctant to act. \nThe ‘Court of Justice of the European Union’ currently consists of two courts: the \nGeneral Court (the court of frst instance for many cases) and the Court of Justice (the main court). Older books and many writers in academia and mainstream media often refer to the ‘ECJ’ – this is strictly speaking outdated. It would be better to use the acronyms ‘CJEU’ for all courts and ‘CJ’ when referring to the Court of Justice, but old habits die hard. \nArticle 19 of the Treaty on European Union also allows for the existence of ‘spe -\ncialised courts’, and the EU actually had a Civil Service Tribunal (deciding employ -\nment questions between the EU and its civil servants) from 2005 until 2016, when the member states decided to abolish this tribunal and to expand the General Court to 56 (now 54) judges instead. While the treaty allows fexibility for the General Court (‘at least one judge per Member State’), the CJ always consists of one judge per Member State. \nIn addition to the judges, the Court also has 11 Advocates General. If an important \ncase reaches the Court, an Advocate General will be asked to submit an opinion on the case. These are usually more interesting to read than the rather technical judgments and are often, but not always, followed by the Court. In the media, an opinion by an Advocate General is sometimes confused with the actual judgment, but it is not legally binding for anyone. \n\n--- Page 99 ---\n   \n \n \n  \n  68 INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW \nWhat is European Union law? \nEuropean Union law is a complex area of law that does not quite ft into any of the estab -\nlished categories. It is ultimately based on treaties between states, but it is far too inte -\ngrated into the domestic laws of the EU’s member states to be simply considered a \nsub-discipline of international law either. \nThe predecessor of the EU, the EEC, was established in 1958 and has grown ever \nsince. Both in terms of member states and population (from 6 member states in 1958 to 27 in 2020) and in terms of the developments of its legal system. While the original EEC was very much an international organisation limited to very specifc areas as described in the previous sections, today’s EU is a complex organisation sui generis  (of its own kind) \nthat has a large infuence on the daily lives of its ca 450 million citizens. Quite how this development happened – because the member states actively worked towards that or because the institutions developed a momentum of their own – is an interesting feld of study that has flled many political science books (‘European Integration’). \nIn any case, it is certainly true that the Court of Justice of the EU played a large part in \nthis through major landmark decisions that will be discussed below. \nWhat are the sources of EU law? \nTreaties \nThe most important source of law for the EU are the treaties. Legally, they are the only reason for the Union’s existence and have established the different institutions of the EU discussed above. \nEU treaties follow the same procedure as international treaties – they are negotiated, \nsigned and ratifed by the member states. All other forms of EU law have to comply with the treaties, which means that ultimately the member states have the last word on any issue. \nWhat makes this area a bit complicated is that there are many treaties that defned the \nEU, as you already read. Essentially, there are two major founding treaties: The Treaty of Rome establishing the EEC and the Treaty of Maastricht establishing the EU. \nThe other treaties mentioned above – SEA, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon – are also \ntreaties in their own right but have modifed the two founding treaties. In some cases, they added or removed articles, and in other cases, they renumbered a signifcant amount of articles (especially in the Amsterdam and Lisbon treaties). \nThis means that for the purpose of understanding the current state of the law, we look \nat the consolidated versions of the two founding treaties – the latest version that incorpo -\nrates all changes from the modifcation treaties: \n1. The Treaty on European Union (TEU, the Maastricht Treaty), explaining the institution and the political processes \n2. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU, the Rome Treaty), going into far more detail on the legal rules governing the internal market. \n\n--- Page 100 ---\n    \n  \n    INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW 69 \nWhen reading old cases or journal articles, you need to be aware that the numbering of the Treaty Articles has changed over time (the preliminary ruling procedure, the most important legal procedure in the Court of Justice, has, for example, moved from Article 177 TEEC to Article 234 TEC with the Amsterdam Treaty and to Article 267 TFEU with the Treaty of Lisbon). If you are confused (and you will be), you can fnd the changes in the ‘Table of Equivalences’ that is included in the statute book. \nSecondary legislation \nAs mentioned before, the treaties establish the different institutions. In addition, they also enable the institutions to make secondary legislation, governed by the principle of confer -\nral in Article 5 of the TEU: the institutions are only allowed to make laws in areas where the treaties explicitly enable this. The institutions of the EU cannot, therefore, make laws in other areas like Criminal Law or Taxation. \nThe institutions can, according to Article 288 TFEU, make the following laws: \n  Regulations: rules that immediately apply in all member states \n  Directives: rules that are directed towards the member states and that need to be implemented to have an effect \n  Decisions: administrative rules that are directed at individuals, particular states or companies \nThis is usually done by a process called the Ordinary Legislative Procedure, a process that involves three of the institutions mentioned above: \n1. The Commission has the right of initiative. Every law is proposed by the Commission \n2. The European Parliament and … \n3. The Council of the EU then have to agree to a version of the law. Both institutions can modify the proposal and aim to reach a compromise in a process, not unlike the leg -\nislative ping pong played between the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the UK. \nThis procedure shall ensure that there is a mix of EU interest (Commission), democratic input (Parliament) and Member State representation (Council) involved in the outcome. When the Council votes, it does so in the ‘Qualifed Majority Procedure’ – a vote is suc -\ncessful if at least 55% of the member states agree and these member states represent at least 65% of the population. \nOnce this procedure is done, the legislation is published in the offcial journal of the \nEU. It also gets assigned a number, which is then used to refer to it in the future: \n  Regulations (since 1967) get numbered with a sequential number, the year, and the \norganisation (EU, Euratom or before December 2009 EC) in brackets: Regulation (EC) 1612/88 – regulation number 1612 in 1988 \n\n--- Page 101 ---\n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n 70 INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW \n  Directives are numbered similarly, but in a different order: \nDirective 2004/38/EC \n  Decisions also have a slightly different order: Decision No 477/2010/EU \nEffect of EU law \nSo far, none of the above is overly unusual for international organisations, except for, to an extent, the idea of majority voting. What is completely different, however, is how that law applies in practice, which has been established by the Court of Justice in a series of landmark cases. \nDirect effect \nIn van Gend en Loos , the Court established the principle of direct effect. Normal inter -\nnational law only binds states in their relations with each other; what happens with the treaties within the country is entirely up to the country itself (as discussed above in the ‘Monism’ and ‘Dualism’ part). When a Dutch transport company (van Gend) was told by the Dutch Government that the European Economic Community Treaty has no relevance to them, the Court of Justice, however, decided that the European Economic Community is not normal international law. Instead, it is ‘a new legal order of international law’, which does not just create obligations for individuals, but also rights.\n16 Van Gend was therefore \nable to reclaim the custom duties it should not have paid under the EEC Treaty. \nThe Court went even further in the case of Defrenne v SABENA (1976). In this case, \nMs Defrenne, a fight attendant from Belgium, noticed that her male colleagues were receiving higher salaries than she did. Belgian legislation could not help her at the time, so she successfully relied on what is now Article 157 of the TFEU – equal pay for equal work.\n17 What makes the case important is the fact that her opponent in the case was not \nthe Belgian state, but a private airline: the Court of Justice established the principle that not only states have to comply with the obligations under the treaty, but also individuals. In the literature, this is often referred to as ‘horizontal direct effect’ – the treaty is effec -\ntive between private parties – contrary to ‘vertical direct effect’, where the treaty is used against the state. \nIn later cases, the Court has extended the principle of vertical direct effect to second -\nary legislation, including directives,\n18 and it has clarifed that regulations and decisions \nare also capable of horizontal direct effect.19 \nThe situation with horizontal direct effect of directives is more complicated. The Court \nhas decided that directives should, in general, only bind the state, and therefore not have direct horizontal effect,\n20 but it has made exceptions to the general rule.21 \n16 Case 26-62 NV Algemene Transport en Expeditie Onderneming van Gend en Loos  v Nederlandse \nAdminstratie van Belastingen  [1962]. \n17 Case 43/75 Gabrielle Defrenne  v Société Anonyme Belge De Navigation Aérienne SABENA [1976]. \n18 41/74 van Duyn v Home Offce  [1974]. \n19 Case 9/70 Grad v Finanzamt Traunstein  [1970]. \n20 Case C-271/91 Helen Marshall v Southampton Area Health Authority [1993]. \n21 See, for example, Case 14/83 Von Colson and Kamann v Land Nordrhein Westfalen  [1984]. \n\n--- Page 102 ---\n    \n \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW 71 \nSupremacy \nShortly after the landmark decision in van Gend , the Court of Justice was confronted with \nanother case of similar signifcance: Mr Costa was not willing to pay his electricity bill, \nbecause he claimed the law that set up the company asking him for payment was illegal under EU law. The Italian Government argued that this should not matter: the EEC treaty was ratifed in 1958, and the Italian law came after the treaty. If two laws are in confict, the general rule is that the newer law prevails over the older one. \nHowever, the Court of Justice disagreed. It argued once more with the ‘new legal \norder’ and stated that allowing later laws to challenge the validity of EU law would mean ‘the legal basis of the Community itself being called into question’.\n22 Essentially, Italy \nwould be able to amend the Treaty as far as its citizens are concerned, and there would be little stopping – let’s say – France from prohibiting its shops from selling Italian wines or Germany banning French workers. Instead of an internal market where a German worker can take up employment in Sweden and a Portuguese company can sell its prod -\nuct to customers in Slovakia, the EU would be a complex set of opposing national rules. Therefore, EU law, according to the Court of Justice, must have primacy (or supremacy) over the laws of its member states: when there is a confict between national and EU law, all national judges have an obligation to ‘set aside’ the national law in question.\n23 \nWhat seems logical from the Court of Justice’s perspective created quite an outrage \namongst national courts. Particularly the German Constitutional Court brought forward challenges to the doctrine of supremacy, followed by other courts. However, all these challenges were raised as points of principle – no court has ruled out the principle of supremacy yet, and it seems to work very well in practice. \nLocating EU law \nLegislation \nAll offcial legal sources of the European Union can easily be found on the website eur-lex .europa.eu. There, you can look at the treaties in their current, consolidated version (in the 23 offcial languages of the EU), and you can search other legal acts – regulations, direc -\ntives and decisions. You can either search for the offcial year and number (e.g. 2004/38 for the citizenship directive) or for fragments of texts you are interested in (‘European citizenship’ or ‘professional qualifcations’). \nCases \nFinding cases of the European Courts is very easy. The Court of Justice of the European Union has a very useful website under curia.europa.eu, where you will fnd a search func -\ntion for cases. Unless you already know the case number (which should be given in a ref -\nerence) or the names of the parties (e.g. ‘van Gend’), you can use the extensive ‘Advanced Search’ function, where you can, for example, search for any cases involving competition law between 2004 and 2006 or for any cases against the Republic of France in 1995. \n22 Case 6-64 Flaminio Costa  v ENEL  [1964]. \n23 Case 106/77 Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato  v Simmenthal SpA  [1978[. \n\n--- Page 103 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n                                 72 INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW \nEUROPEAN UNION LAW IN THE UK AFTER BREXIT \nThe extensive detail this chapter gives to an introduction into European Union law might \nbe a little confusing – after all, this book is aimed at law students in England and Wales – and the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020. \nEU law is still important for a number of reasons. For once, you are likely to come \nacross cases from before 2021, and understanding some European law is essential to understanding these cases. Judges in the UK have made decisions based on EU law, have been infuenced by the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EU or might have followed a preliminary ruling from the Court on the issue at hand or on a related question. Law making has been infuenced and shaped by EU treaties, regulations or directives and by decisions made by the Court of Justice. \nMany laws of the EU still apply in the UK. According to the UK’s own European Union \nWithdrawal Act 2018, directly effective EU Law, such as regulations, became part of the UK’s domestic law after the withdrawal,\n24 and directly effective rights and obligations that \nexisted before 31 January 2020 continue to recognised and available in UK domestic law.\n25 \nDoctrines in public law have been infuenced by European debates as well. Important \ncases that involve the European Union (e.g. the case of the ‘Metric Martyrs’26 or the more \nrecent case of Miller and Cherry27) are going to remain very relevant, as they concern \ncentral aspects of the British Constitution like the Rule of Law, Parliamentary Sovereignty and the Royal Prerogative. \nThe European Union is, and probably will remain, the most important trading partner \nof the United Kingdom. Every company in the UK that exports or imports products or services to or from the EU will need to comply with EU law when doing that. The same is true for American or Chinese laws, but it is far more likely that a solicitor gets in contact with businesses from Paris or Dublin than with businesses from Shanghai or Chicago. \nAnd we should not forget that an important part of the UK – Northern Ireland – has \nremained part of most of the single market. The Court of Justice still has jurisdiction over these issues within Northern Ireland, and the Withdrawal Agreement (a treaty that both the UK and the EU have ratifed) makes it quite clear that the case law of the Court of Justice – which, of course includes the aforementioned principles of direct effect and supremacy – shall apply in Northern Ireland.\n28 \nBesides, the UK has been integrated into this complex legal system for a period of \nalmost 40 years. Many laws in the UK – for example, most laws around consumer protec -\ntion or the environment – are results of UK legislators implementing EU directives. It is therefore important to know the implications that the period of membership in the EU still has to this date. \n24 s 3 European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. \n25 s 4 European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. \n26 Thoburn v Sunderland City Council and other appeals [2002] EWHC 195 Admin; [2003] QB 151; [2002] 4 \nAll ER 156. \n27 R (Miller) v The Prime Minister and Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland [2019] UKSC 41. \n28 Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the \nEuropean Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, available at < https://eur-lex.europa.eu/ \nlegal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02020W%2FTXT-20200613 > (accessed 30 November 2020). \n\n--- Page 104 ---\n    INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW 73 \nCONCLUSION \nNo country is alone. The United Kingdom is part of an elaborate construct of interna -\ntional organisations, bilateral and multilateral treaties, and laws within the UK are shaped \nand infuenced by this. The UK is bound by treaties and by customary international law and generally respect its obligations, even though these function quite differently from national law – no court and no world police can force a state to comply. \nWithin the UK, however, international law only has limited application. The doctrine \nof dualism means that only those international treaties that have been incorporated into national law by Parliament have an effect in the domestic legal system. \nDespite the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, EU law still has an enormous \nimpact on the UK and will continue to hold this for the foreseeable future. It is therefore essential that students are at the very least familiar with the basics of EU law in order to understand how this deeply integrated international organisation works. \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  Public International Laws are the laws that bind states. \n  The two most important sources of international law are treaties and customary international law. \n  Treaties need to be signed, ratifed and enter into force before having any legal effect. They then only have a legal effect on their member states. When you come across a treaty in your research, you will need to check whether the treaty applies to the country you are looking at. \n  Another thing to look out for are reservations. Reservations allow states to opt out of certain parts of a treaty, but there are rules as to how far states can go in this. \n  If a state breaks a treaty, it could face sanctions following from the treaty itself (as is the case, for example, in the European Union). There is no mandatory world court and no world police to enforce treaties or international law in general, though. \n  Customary international law are norms that arise because states have always acted in a certain way and have believed to have done so out of a legal obligation. \n  International law is effective within domestic courts only if Parliament has imple -\nmented it into domestic law. \n  The European Union is a highly integrated, initially economic, organisation that con -\nsists of 27 member states. The UK was a member of the organisation from 1973 to 2020. \n  The member states of the EU have created institutions that ensure the functioning of the organisation. The Commission, Council (i.e. the ministers of the member states) and the European Parliament make laws. \n\n--- Page 105 ---\n   \n 74 INTERNATIONAL AND EUROPEAN LAW \n  These laws come in the form of regulations (which are directly applicable in all mem -\nber states), directives (which have to be implemented by the member states and \ndecisions (administrative acts that can be targeted)). \n  The Court of Justice is a very powerful institution at the centre of the EU and has cre -\nated the doctrines of direct effect and supremacy, both of which ensure that EU law can be enforced in the courts of the member states, even if national law contradicts it. \n  EU Legislation and case law can be easily located via the websites of the EU and of the Court of Justice. \n  Even after the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, EU law continues to hold relevance for the UK – especially, but not just in Northern Ireland. \n\n--- Page 106 ---\n4 \n  \n HUMAN RIGHTS \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Explain the concept of human rights. \n  Differentiate between the Council of Europe and the European Union. \n  Understand the basic human rights guaranteed by the European Convention of \nHuman Rights. \n  Understand how this Convention operates in UK law – the Human Rights Act 1998. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-5  \n\n--- Page 107 ---\n \n \n \n \n    \n                  \n  \n                  \n  \n                                             \n               \n              \n                  76 HUMAN RIGHTS  \nTHE CONCEPT OF HUMAN RIGHTS \nHuman rights are rights inherent to every human being. A human being is born with rights \nand does not have to earn them. These can be restricted by the government, but only for very good reasons (the standard example is that you are not allowed to yell ‘Fire!’ in a crowded theatre, no matter how much the country you are in values free speech). \nThere are different origin stories where human rights come from and what their philo -\nsophical justifcation is.\n1 Often, the idea is traced back to Cyrus the Great, the founder of \nthe Persian Empire in the sixth century BC, who among other things declared freedom of religion and freedom from slavery after conquering a city by inscribing it on a cylinder that can now be seen in the British Museum.\n2 In modern times, the origins are often seen \nin the American and French Revolutions. The US Declaration of Independence contains the famous phrase \nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n3 \nDuring the French Revolution, the Déclaration des droits de l’homme et du citoyen was passed in 1789 and contains human rights principles that are still used today. And even before that, the Magna Carta 1215 and the English Bill of Rights 1689 contain some – albeit limited – notions of protection of rights. \nEven though a longer exploration would go beyond the scope of this book, these ori -\ngin stories are important. Probably the most important debate underlying the concept of human rights is the long-lasting discussion of whether human rights truly are universal – the same everywhere without restrictions – or whether they are a construct by the West, used as a tool to show the uncivilised nature of the rest of the world and as a justifcation for global military interventions. If you study human rights as an elective subject or at Masters level, you will defnitely need to study and discuss this question in more detail. \nBroadly speaking there are three different categories of rights (although the distinction \nbetween them is not always very clear, and there are quite signifcant overlaps between them): \n  Civil and political rights (like freedom from torture or freedom of expression) \n  Social, economic and cultural rights (like the right to housing or clean water) \n  Group rights (like the right to self-determination or to a sustainable environment) \nThe reason for this split is political and ideological: during the Cold War the states in \nthe capitalist West were proud of their track record on civil and political rights, while the \n1 F or good overviews, see G Nice, ‘Human Rights: Philosophy and History’ (23 October 2014) < https:// \nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=9EBz77dsAmo > (accessed 24 November 2020); and the interesting pres -\nentation by Professor Gearty, ‘Burning Issue: The DNA of Human Rights’ (24 February 2012) < https:// \nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=U88_GY7uQwg > (accessed 24 November 2020). \n2 F or a differing opinion, however, see M Schulz, ‘UN Treasure Honours Persian Despot’ Der Spiegel  (15 \nJuly 2018) <https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/falling-for-ancient-propaganda-un-treasure-hono \nrs-persian-despot-a-566027.html> (accessed 24 November 2020). \n3 U nited States Declaration of Independence (14 July 1776), available at < https://www.archives.gov/found \ning-docs/declaration-transcript > (accessed 24 November 2020). \n\n--- Page 108 ---\n   \n \n                           HUMAN RIGHTS 77 \nstates in the Communist East were proud of their track record when it came to social, \neconomic and cultural rights. The third category of rights is often ascribed to states from the Global South and to philosophies that have less of an emphasis on individualism. \nPurist proponents of the so-called frst generation of rights would argue that issues \nlike social security or education belong to politics rather than law. As long as everyone has the right to express themselves, to read and write whatever they want, to demonstrate and to vote for anyone they want, people can choose their preferred political system. If the people so desire, the political system can then include a strong social security net. \nThe other side of the argument is that it is more important to satisfy the basic needs \nof the population. Your right to vote is meaningless if you do not have the education to understand what you are voting on, and your right to demonstrate is meaningless if you need to work 16 hours a day to feed your family. A free press really only helps the wealthy newspaper owners who have every interest to protect the status quo, and unless a level of equality is established, it might be necessary to suppress opinions that go against the system that is trying to make things better for everyone. \nWith the exception of some extremes, the dominating opinion nowadays would lie \nsomewhere in the middle: both categories of rights are equally important and support each other. However, the history is still visible in the different human right treaties and, more importantly, in the extent to which rights can be enforced in courts. \nINTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHT TREATIES \nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 \nProbably the most famous human rights document is the Universal Declaration. Under the impression of the horrors of the Second World War, the newly formed United Nations set up the Commission on Human Rights, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt. The commission wrote 30 articles that include civil and political rights like the prohibition of slavery (Article 4) or torture (Article 5), the freedom from arbitrary arrest (Article 9) and the freedom of religion (Article 18), but also economic and social rights like the right to social security (Article 22) or the right to work (Article 23). \nThe General Assembly of the United Nations approved the Declaration on 10 December \n1948,\n4 and the document has by now been translated into over 500 languages.5 \nDespite its almost universal popularity and fame, the Universal Declaration does, how-\never, have no real legal value. The principles and many rights contained in it have been used as a basis for many binding human right treaties and laws, but you will not be able to build a legal argument on the Universal Declaration itself. \nThe International Covenants \nMore relevant legally are the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Both of these came into force in 1966 and contain legal obligations for its member states. \n4 A /RES/3/217A. \n5 S ee https://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Pages/SearchByLang.aspx. \n\n--- Page 109 ---\n \n                                      \n 78 HUMAN RIGHTS  \nCompliance with these Covenants is monitored by the UN Human Rights Committee \nand by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; both committees \nconsist of experts on the matter. States are required to submit regular reports, and the committees will publish answers to these reports. This method is often called ‘naming and shaming’ and might not feel suffcient for a law student. However, we are dealing with highly political matters here, and it is unlikely that states would be willing to submit themselves to more intrusive enforcement mechanisms. \nIt is possible to raise an individual complaint to the Human Rights Committee, but \nthere is no real enforcement mechanism, only political pressure. \nSpecialised treaties \nThere are a number of UN treaties that were set up for specifc issues: \n  International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination \n(ICERD), 1965 \n  Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), 1979 \n  Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), 1984 \n  Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), 1989 \n  International Convention on Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (ICMRW), 1990 \nAll of these concern very important things, but legally speaking, they are treaties. This means they follow the same rules as described in the previous chapter on international law. States are only bound when they sign and ratify them, and states can even make reservations to these treaties. \nThese reservations can concern relatively trivial matters, but they can also go to the \nheart of the treaty. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) shows this (as mentioned in Chapter 3 ): this treaty is one of the \nmost ratifed treaties in the world, but it sadly also carries an enormously high number of reservations.\n6 Some are relatively harmless and can probably be justifed with culture \nand tradition (there are quite a few reservations made by western states regarding fam -\nily names), others are quite extreme: Saudi Arabia states that ‘[i]n case of contradiction between any term of the Convention and the norms of Islamic law, the Kingdom is not under obligation to observe the contradictory terms of the Convention’.\n7 \nIt shows the problems with reservations: while it is probably good to get Spain to ratify \nthe treaty, even if it means accepting a discriminatory practice when it comes to fam -\nily names (children get the last name of both father and mother; however, the mother’s name drops in the next generation), it is diffcult to accept Saudi Arabia’s reservation, as it means that the Convention is only legally meaningful there if Saudi laws agree. \n6 S ee https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&mtdsg_no=IV-8&chapter=4&lang=en for a \nlist of reservations. \n7 Ibid. \n\n--- Page 110 ---\n   \n             \n                   \n                HUMAN RIGHTS 79 \nFor you, this means that you will need to make sure that the state you are looking at \nhas actually ratifed the treaty you are looking at, and you need to make sure the relevant \npart for your argument has not been reduced by a reservation. \nRegional systems \nBesides the many treaties on a United Nations level, there are also regional treaties that try to enforce human rights. The oldest and most successful of these is the European Convention on Human Rights 1950, which we will discuss in more detail below, but there are other treaties as well: the American Convention on Human Rights (1969) and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (1987). \nThese treaties have their own institutions and a court, but the European Convention \nstands out because it is the only system that provides direct access to the Court for indi -\nviduals. In the other two systems, individuals can apply to a commission that can bring the case to a court. \nThere is also a relatively young Arab Charter on Human Rights (2004), which is still \nwaiting for enough ratifcations on a treaty for establishing a court system. This treaty has been criticised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for its approach to the rights of women and children and for its equation of Zionism with racism.\n8 \nDue to its importance for the UK, this chapter will only discuss the European Convention \nin detail. \nTHE COUNCIL OF EUROPE AND THE EUROPEAN \nCONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS (ECHR) \nThe Council of Europe \nThe ‘Council of Europe’ is an organisation set up by the Treaty of London 1949 to actively \nmonitor and support three main areas of European interest: human rights, democracy and respect for the rule of law. \nInitially, there were only ten founding states; Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, \nLuxembourg, Netherlands, UK, Norway and Sweden. Over the past 60 years a further 37 states have joined the original ten founding states bringing the current membership of the Council of Europe to 47 nations which together cover an estimated 800 million people. Any European state can be a member of the Council of Europe if certain basic minimum standards of conduct, particularly in relation to the observation of human rights and fun -\ndamental freedoms, are observed. Additionally, the Council of Europe (CoE) will enter into partnership agreements with states outside Europe. \nSpecial arrangements were made in 2010 to make it possible for the European Union \nto be a signatory to the Treaty of London, although it is not by itself a European state. However, the Court of Justice of the European Union stopped the previous attempt of the EU to join the CoE, and we are currently in limbo when and how this will happen. \n8 H umanists International, ‘The Arab Charter on Human Rights is incompatible with international stand -\nards – Louise Arbour’ (11 March 2008), available https://humanists.international/2008/03/arab-charter-hu \nman-rights-incompatible-international-standards-louise-arbour/, accessed 29 July 2019. \n\n--- Page 111 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n                    80 HUMAN RIGHTS  \nPrior to that, the CoE had a good working relationship with the EU. Indeed, one of the con -\nditions for membership of the EU has always been that a prospective member state is a mem -\nber of the Council of Europe and a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights. This was designed to ensure that a state’s policies on human rights are acceptable. For many states, membership of the CoE is seen as a frst step towards being in a position to accept the greater obligations involved with EU membership. However, the CoE is a completely separate institution from the EU and should never be confused with it. Unfortunately, politicians and journalists frequently do, but as a law student, you should know better! \nIt does not help that the Council of Europe uses the same fag (a circle of 12 golden \nstars on a blue background) and the same anthem (the ‘Ode to Joy’, the fourth move -\nment of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony) as the European Union, and that it is located in Strasbourg, which is also the seat of the European Union’s Parliament. The Council of Europe will, rightly, say that it was frst using these symbols, and that they stand for Europe, not for one particular organisation. \nThe European Convention on Human Rights \nThe most important legal document from the Council of Europe is without any doubt the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which came into force in 1953. In 2020, the Convention has been ratifed by 47 member states – all member states of the Council of Europe.\n9 \nThe ECHR is important for the European Union, but again, it is not part of it. This also \nmeans that the withdrawal of the UK from the EU has no relevance for the UK’s membership of the ECHR. The UK is still bound by the Convention and by decisions by the European Court of Human Rights. Every once in a while, politicians on the right side of the spectrum play with the idea of leaving the European Convention as well as the European Union, and every once in a while politicians and commentators display their ignorance by claiming the UK already did leave the ECHR, but so far none of this has happened. In case the UK (or any other country) really wanted to leave the ECHR, the procedure for this is laid out in Article 58. \nThe rationale behind the ECHR is the protection of an agreed core of human rights, such \nas the right to life, to a family, to privacy, and to freedom from slavery. Later protocols have extended the rights protected by the ECHR to include amongst other rights economic, social, educational and cultural rights and the right to economic and political determinism for states and indigenous peoples. These protocols are optional – member states to the ECHR do not have to sign the additional protocols. Many member states, including the UK, have refused to sign certain additional protocols, and it is important for you to check whether the member state is bound by a protocol before discussing the rights contained in it. \nThe European Court of Human Rights \nAdmissibility \nThis is a court established by the CoE in 1959 to hear claims by individuals who had exhausted all of the avenues of complaint nationally available in relation to the European \n9 T he full list of ratifcations and reservations can be found at: https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full \n-list/-/conventions/treaty/005/signatures. \n\n--- Page 112 ---\n   \n \n \n        \n                               \n HUMAN RIGHTS 81 \nConvention on Human Rights 1950, initially through an application to the European \nCommission on Human Rights. Revisions to the structure of the CoE in 1998 led to the abolition of the Commission and the establishment of a new Court of Human Rights. \nThe European Court of Human Rights hears cases by individuals and groups who: \n  Claim to be a victim of a violation of a right by a state party (Article 34 ECHR) \n  Have exhausted all domestic remedies (Article 35 ECHR) \nThis means that nobody can complain about right violations committed towards others, only about themself. Amnesty International could, for example, make a complaint if they are prevented in their activities by a member state or suffered repression, but it could not make a complaint about the systematic injustice in the prison system of a member state in general. \nThe exhaustion of domestic remedies is often diffcult to fulfl, particularly in a country \nwith an expensive legal system like the United Kingdom. A victim of a human right viola -\ntion will need to pursue every legal action possible in their home country. Only when the last appeal is rejected can the individual make a valid complaint at the ECtHR. \nThe Court will further (under Art 35 ECHR) reject cases that are: \n  Anonymous. \n  About a matter already submitted and do not contain new information. \n  ‘Manifestly ill-founded’. \n  An abuse of the right of application. \nThe question of admission is very important – the Court rejects around 82 per cent of all applications as inadmissible.\n10 More information can be found in the admissibility guide \npublished by the Court.11 \nMargin of appreciation \nThe margin of appreciation is an important doctrine to keep in mind when trying to under -\nstand judgments of the Court. In the view of some, this doctrine allows the Court to account for cultural differences among its large membership; in the view of others, it allows the Court to be far too lenient on its member states. \nWhile there have been uses of it before, the doctrine got the most attention in the case \nHandyside v United Kingdom (1976).\n12 Richard Handyside published a Danish school-\nbook, The Little Red Schoolbook , which went against the British understanding of morals \nat the time (the book aimed at explaining sex to children and told them, amongst other things, that masturbation is harmless). As a result, Handyside was convicted for a viola -\ntion of obscenity laws. The case raised the question of whether the freedom of expres -\nsion in Article 10 of the ECHR should be the same everywhere – after all, the book was allowed in Denmark and other ECHR member states. \n10 https://app.echr.coe.int/CheckList/ \n11 https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Admissibility_guide_ENG.pdf \n12 Handyside v The United Kingdom , 5493/72, European Court of Human Rights, 4 November 1976 \n\n--- Page 113 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n                 \n \n                                      \n 82 HUMAN RIGHTS  \nWhat is important to consider is Paragraph 2 of Article 10: \nThe exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibili -\nties, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as \nare prescribed by law and are necessary for a democratic society, in the inter -\nests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confdence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary. \nThe Court had to, therefore, defne what ‘necessary in a democratic society’ means, and it took the view that it is not the best authority to defne this: ‘[b]y reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements’.\n13 In other words, it left this question in the hands of the UK, as long \nas the member state stays within a ‘margin of appreciation’. \nThe doctrine has been used in many different areas. A recent controversial case \nincludes S.A.S. v France , where the Court held that a ban on face veils is within France’s \nmargin of appreciation (the freedom of religion in Article 9 can also be limited if ‘neces -\nsary in a democratic society’).14 \nIt is important to keep this principle in mind and to be careful when describing a \ncase like S.A.S. v France : the Court has not decided that it is ‘necessary in a demo -\ncratic society’ to ban wearing a veil covering the face, but the Court has decided that it thinks the French government is in a better position to judge what is necessary for the French democratic society and that the decision is not outside of that government’s discretion. \nCases against the United Kingdom \nIn 1996, UK citizens were given the right to petition the ECtHR, and a lot has changed since. Over 24,000 applications were made against the UK, but only 1,855 of these were considered admissible.\n15 In 315 cases, the UK was found to have violated at least one \narticle of the ECHR.16 \nThese numbers sound very large, but it is important to keep in mind that the vast \nmajority of cases are either not admitted or decided in favour of the United Kingdom. Other states (especially Russia, Turkey and Italy) have had multiple times the complaints that the United Kingdom has received. \n13 Ibid., para 48. \n14 S.A.S. v France , 43835/11, European Court of Human Rights, 1 July 2014. \n15 European Court of Human Rights, ‘Overview 1959–2019’ (2020), available at < https://www.echr.coe.int/ \nDocuments/Overview_19592019_ENG.pdf > (accessed 26 November 2020) 3. \n16 J Dawson, ‘House of Commons Briefng Paper: UK Cases at the European Court of Human Rights Since \n1975’ (19 December 2019) http://researchbriefngs.fles.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8049/CBP-8049 \n.pdf> (accessed 26 November 2020). \n\n--- Page 114 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n HUMAN RIGHTS 83 \nHUMAN RIGHTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM \nHuman Rights before 1998 \nWhile the UK signed and ratifed the ECHR in 1951, it entered a reservation with respect to some of the articles in the subsequent protocols that it has signed and ratifed. In addition, the UK has not signed protocols 4, 6 and 13. When dealing with protocols it is particularly important to know which member states of the Council of Europe have signed and ratifed protocols and where exactly there are derogations and reservations, as this affects the legal infuence of the ECHR on those states. \nAs discussed in the previous chapter, the UK adopts a dualist position with regard to \ntreaties under international law; therefore, the ECHR and decisions of the ECtHR have had no automatic impact on English law. If a case goes to the Court and is decided against the UK, the Court has no power to force the UK to take any remedial action. \nIn 1965, the UK Government gave UK citizens the right to take their grievances directly \nto the European Court of Human Rights. As time passed several judgments occurred that were highly embarrassing for the UK Government. Despite their lack of legal effect in the UK the government does have an obligation under international law to comply and it has done so, with the notable exception of the various decisions that the government refusal to allow prisoners voting rights in public elections was a breach of the ECHR. \nHowever, although the ECHR and the decisions of the ECtHR had no force in the \nEnglish legal system, they were not ignored. The English courts were indeed infuenced by them. Judges in the UK’s Supreme Court have stated that they would presume that Parliament did not intend to legislate contrary to the ECHR. Therefore, when judges needed to choose between two possible interpretations of the law in a situation, one con -\nforming to the ECHR and one not conforming, then the interpretation in conformity with the ECHR is generally preferred. Lord Bridge of Harwich gave a clear indication of this in the Brind case 1991,\n17 stating: \nit is already well settled that, in construing any provision in domestic legisla -\ntion which is ambiguous in the sense that it is capable of a meaning which either conforms to or conficts with the Convention, the courts will presume that Parliament intended to legislate in conformity with the Convention, not in confict with it.\n18 \nDespite the general view expressed above, Lord Bridge was careful to stress that it should not be assumed that such an interpretation must be applied, as judicial discretion remained.\n19 He observed, however, that in the current case the discretion used by the \n17 See R v Secretary of State for the Home Offce, ex p Brind (1991) 1 AC 696. Brind  was a case concern -\ning an alleged violation of Article 10, the right to freedom of expression, and Article 13, the right to an \neffective national remedy. It was raised in connection with the Secretary of State’s statutory powers to prohibit certain broadcasts by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). \n18 Ibid., 697. \n19 See generally Equality and Human Rights Commission Research report 83: fn 23. \n\n--- Page 115 ---\n \n \n \n                               84 HUMAN RIGHTS  \nSecretary of State had no limit attached to it and therefore when Parliament does this it \nmeans just that. There are no limits and: \nto presume that it must be exercised within Convention limits would be to go far beyond the resolution of an ambiguity. It would be to impute to Parliament an inten -\ntion not only that the executive should exercise the discretion in conformity with the Convention, but also that the domestic courts should enforce that conformity by the importation into domestic administrative law of the text of the Convention and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in the interpretation and application of it.\n20 \nAs a signatory of the ECHR and a range of its protocols, the UK has been the subject of applications to the European Court of Human Rights for violation of the treaty on many occasions, as have other signatory states. \nBetween 1975 and 1990, 30 cases were brought against the UK. In 21 of these the \nEuropean Court found that the government had violated the ECHR or its protocols. Just seven years later in 1997, the total of successful cases against the UK Government was in the region of 50.\n21 \nThe Human Rights Act 1998 \nIn 1998 the Human Rights Act gave UK citizens the right to bring cases in the UK’s domes -\ntic courts against a public authority for the breach of most, but not all, of the articles pro -\ntecting human rights in the ECHR and selected articles in protocols ratifed by the UK. It also gives an overriding power for the Crown to intervene in any proceedings brought by individuals against a public authority. \nThe Act further stipulates that the UK Parliament when enacting general public leg -\nislation, as well as the courts of the English legal system. Courts are subject to certain procedures and obligations when dealing with certain articles in the ECHR. \nBackground to the Human Rights Act 1998 and current concerns \nThe Labour Government that came to power in 1997 listed, as one of their major election manifesto promises, improving the protection of human rights in the UK. They quickly published a White Paper, ‘Rights brought home: the Human Rights Bill’,\n22 with an attached \ndraft bill. It gave UK citizens the right to bring claims against public authorities (govern -\nments, local authorities, large utility companies exercising state-like functions, etc.) in domestic courts. It also set out plans to make UK public authorities more accountable for their actions with regard to human rights violations. Individuals could also raise the issue of human rights violations under the ECHR and relevant protocols in any proceedings brought against them by a public authority. For the purposes of this Act courts are seen as public bodies that can be the object of a claim. \n20 Ibid., 698. \n21 For a source of statistics and critical commentary see the details of the law report in fn 24. \n22 CM 3782, available at < https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-human-rights-bill> (accessed \n27 November 2020). \n\n--- Page 116 ---\n   \n \n HUMAN RIGHTS 85 \nThe key sections of the Human Rights Act 1998 \nThe HRA is designed to make it easier, cheaper and quicker for individuals to take action \nagainst public authorities for violations of the ECHR and its protocols when carrying out their public functions. \nIt does this by listing the articles that are covered by the Act in s 1 and naming them \n‘convention rights’. This includes the rights in the Convention itself (except for Article 13, the right to an effective remedy), Protocol 1 and Protocol 13 (the abolition of the death penalty). The full text of all ‘convention rights’ is set out in Schedule 1. \nIn relation to these convention rights the HRA sets up a statutory duty to be imposed \non all public authorities (including the courts and Parliament in its law making capacity) to ensure they function in a manner that is compatible with the ECHR.\n23 \nThe powers of the courts regarding legislation are laid out in Sections 3 and 4. \nParliament is sovereign in the United Kingdom, which means that no court can declare Acts of Parliament invalid (unlike, for example, the Supreme Court of the United States or the Federal Constitutional Court in Germany). Therefore, the powers of the courts in the HRA do not go that far: Section 3 gives courts a statutory duty to interpret legislation in a manner compliant with Convention rights, and Section 4 allows the courts to make a declaration of incompatibility. \nWhat is clear from court cases is that the power in s 4 to issue a statement of incom -\npatibility is considered to be the exceptional course of action. Lord Hutton in R v Attorney General  [2003] made this point quite clear when discussing the appropriate role of the \ncourt: \nit is not the function of the courts to keep the statute book up to date … ss 3 and 4 of the Human Rights Act 1998 are not intended to be an instrument by which the courts can chivvy Parliament into spring-cleaning the statute book.\n24 \nA declaration of incompatibility has no effect on the case, and the government can ignore the declaration. The stronger power lies in Article 3 – interpretation can go very far. However, Parliamentary Sovereignty is not touched by the HRA. Parliament can always override human rights, and Parliament can also easily repeal the HRA. \nCourts also have a requirement to take into account the case law of the ECtHR (s 2), \nwhich has exerted an impact on the way that English judges interpret both legislation and case law. The English judiciary have had to make changes to their standard methods of interpretation of statutes. In those areas where the courts have a duty to consider the case law from the European courts they confront a major difference. In English court cases it is customary for dissenting judgments to be published. These are judgments expressing a particular judge’s disagreement with the majority decision of the court. Even where several judges agree on an outcome they can disagree on the detailed route they took to their agreement. Each judge can choose to issue a judgment; therefore, in English courts judges are used to dealing with several judgments in previously decided cases that they may be considering. However, it is customary for the ECtHR to give one decision and the reasons given for their decision are usually less detailed than in English courts. \n23 Section 6. \n24 R v Attorney General  [2003] UKHL 38, 36, Lord Hutton. \n\n--- Page 117 ---\n \n \n                               \n 86 HUMAN RIGHTS  \nThis does not mean that English courts do not themselves give reasons in cases deal -\ning with the ECHR, but the cases it receives from the European level have to be incor -\nporated into their decisions and these cases come from a different tradition where the \ndetailed rationale for the decision is not expected or required.25 However, it is accepted \nthat these cases do in fact lay down frm guidelines that need to be followed. \nFigure 4 .1 sets out the various sections dealing with the statutory duties imposed on \nEnglish courts and tribunals, the UK Parliament and UK public authorities. \nSeveral high profle cases in UK courts applying the HRA have led to clashes between \ngovernment ministers and the decisions of judges in court cases. After the high profle case of Omar Othman v the UK\n26 (Omar Othman is known in the UK as Abu Qatada) the \nHome Secretary, Teresa May, and the Prime Minister, David Cameron, said they would review the question of whether the UK should even remain a party to the European Convention on Human Rights. \nThe facts of the case revolved around the government’s attempts to have Omar \nOthman deported to Jordan. The government had lost court cases on several occasions; Othman pleaded that deportation would be a breach of his right to a family life as his fam -\nily were in England. Eventually, when he left the UK of his own accord, the government were quick to point out that the taxpayers’ bill for the fght to deport Abu Qatada was over £1.7 million, including a legal aid bill of £687,658, and more than £1 million in Home Offce legal fees. No mention was made of the fact that it was the government who had forced the issue to court again and again. \nHome Secretary Teresa May said that she wanted to put reforms into a pending immi -\ngration bill at the end of 2013 restricting appeals based on a right to a family life. \nThe problems caused by the Human Rights Act and the European Court in Strasbourg remain and we should remember that Qatada would have been deported long ago had the European Court not moved the goalposts by establish -\ning new, unprecedented legal grounds on which it blocked his deportation. I have made clear my views that in the end the Human Rights Act must be scrapped. We must also consider our relationship with the European Court very carefully, and I believe that all options – including withdrawing from the convention altogether – should remain on the table.\n27 \nThe British Bill of Rights \nThe Human Rights Act 1998 is not the most popular Act of Parliament, particularly on the right side of the political spectrum. Since its passing, Conservatives have doubted its suitability for the United Kingdom, and a large part of the press has not been too keen on it either. \n25 That is deciding current cases on the same basis as previous similar cases in the Court of Appeal or \nSupreme Court depending on where the case is currently being heard – there is more discussion on these \nmatters in the chapters covering case law. Equally as you will have noted from discussion in \nChapter 4, \nthe same issues arise in cases relating to the European Union. Nor are EU cases from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) based on the English system of rigid adherence to precedent. \n26 ht\ntp://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001–108629. \n27 Teresa May, speaking in the House of Commons on 7 July 2013. \n\n--- Page 118 ---\n   \n \n \n  \n  HUMAN RIGHTS 87 \n• HRA s2: A statutory duty is imposed; courts MUST take account \nof decisions of the ECtHR and the Commi\u0001ee of Ministers.

A British Bill of Rights could be seen as a good \nidea: the ECHR was written in 1950, and constitutes a compromise between many dif -\nferent member states and cultures. Changing it, for example, to address the right of free speech in social media, would require successful negotiations and complex ratifcation procedures in 47 member states that range from liberal to authoritarian and from secular to religiously conservative. Changing a British Bill of Rights, however, would require an Act of Parliament in the UK only – a much easier undertaking. People on the other side of the debate see exactly this as the problem, though: a British Bill of Rights could quite easily be changed by the government of the day for the wrong reasons, and governments have historically shown a tendency to restrict human rights whenever they can. \nIn any case, the 2010 election did not turn out as clearly as Prime Minister David \nCameron hoped, and he had to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, whom he could not convince of this idea. And even though the coalition ended in 2015 and the Conservative Party managed to set up a single-party government, the project never reached a conclusion. In 2017, the Secretary of Justice confrmed that the idea of the ‘British Bill of Rights’ will need to wait until after the withdrawal from the European Union, which binds enough resources in government already.\n28 \nA plan to repeal the Human Rights Act 1998 does not necessarily constitute a prob -\nlem for British membership of the European Convention on Human Rights. Most mem -\nber states have their own human right laws; the British approach of using most of the Convention rights directly within British courts is not required under the Convention. However, Britain would get in a potential struggle with the Council of Europe if this new ‘British Bill of Rights’ protects signifcantly fewer rights than the ECHR. \nWhether this will ever happen remains to be seen. Working out a new bill of rights is \na very challenging undertaking that requires a lot of resources and thought and a lot of careful compromises. \nCONCLUSION \nThis chapter should have provided you with an overview of the topic of human rights. You should now understand what human rights are on both an international and on a domestic level. Most importantly, you have been introduced to the Council of Europe and to the European Convention on Human Rights, which has a strong infuence on the United Kingdom through the Human Rights Act 1998. It is important to remember that, while not even the Supreme Court can change or invalidate Acts of Parliament, the HRA places a duty on the courts to interpret all laws in accordance with the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights. \n28 J Stone, ‘British Bill of Rights plan shelved again for several more years, Justice Secretary confrms’ The \nIndependent (23 February 2017), available at <https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/scrap-hu \nman-rights-act-british-bill-rights-brexit-liz-truss-theresa-may-a7595336.html > (accessed 23 November \n2020). \n\n--- Page 120 ---\n   HUMAN RIGHTS 89 \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  Human Rights are rights that are inherent in human nature, and they do not need to \nbe earned. \n  Traditionally, human rights are divided into three ‘generations’: civil and political rights, economic and social rights, and group-based rights. \n  The most famous human right treaty, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is not legally binding and cannot be enforced. \n  There is a large number of diverse human right treaties, which range from general (e.g. the International Covenants) to specifc (e.g. the Convention against Torture), and from global to regional. \n  While there are regional human right treaties in many parts of the world, the European Convention on Human Rights is the only one that allows individuals to bring com -\nplaints against states directly to a court. \n  The European Court of Human Rights is a powerful actor and has made many deci -\nsions against important member states of the Council of Europe. \n  However, it is imposing self-restraint with the principle of the margin of appreciation: it holds the opinion that member states are better suited to understand certain areas and leaves important decisions to their discretion. \n  Individuals in the United Kingdom can also bring violations of the ECHR to their national courts using the Human Rights Act 1998. \n  The HRA brings Convention Rights into the UK and allows courts to interpret national law and to make a declaration of incompatibility. \n  Many opinion columns and party manifesto paragraphs have been written to intro -\nduce a ‘British Bill of Rights’ instead of the HRA, but none of this has led to anything yet. \n\n--- Page 122 ---\n PART 2 \nWORKING WITH \nTHE LAW \nThe action of studying itself requires the acquisition of general skills that increase your \nability to develop your subject specifc knowledge and understanding. In order to eff -\nciently learn, research, refect, read and produce competent assessments and examina -\ntions you need to know how  to study and how to self-manage your study. Your success \nin your legal studies depends upon your competent understanding of the law, primary texts of law as well as the contexts of law, which involves consideration of secondary texts, texts about law. As students of law it is important you can competently read and understand legislation, case law, the law of the European Union and the mix of European civil law and English domestic law involved in the law relating to human rights. The four chapters in this part are designed to assist you in developing a competent approach to your study of law, how to locate the law, with guidance on how to use your university law library and how to effciently access their print and electronic sources. This will then assist you with the task of understanding and using the primary and secondary texts of law which you have located. \nChapter 5 ‘General study skills’ introduces you to the range of skills required to engage \nin competent study, including the concept of learning and teaching styles. The chapter should help you to Identify ineffcient study habits and how to take action to avoid them. The structure of your degree programme and the cycles of academic life throughout the year and the term are outlined, including how courses and modules make up parts of the degree programme. The importance of being ankle to develop good independent learn -\ning habits and appreciate the need to acquire excellent ICT skills is emphasised. \nChapter 6 ‘Finding material’ will provide you with guidance on how to competently \nnavigate a law library’s resources, which is essential for your success in the study of law. The chapter also focuses on how to fnd domestic and European case law and legislation familiarising yourself with the print (hard copies) and internet sites (e-copies) for access -\ning both, and the range of citations used to enable them to be located. Time is spent discussing ways to ensure that you retrieve the most up to date version of the relevant law. The chapter considers the distinctions between reported and unreported cases, and court transcripts and reports. The hierarchy of the law reports is discussed in terms of their evaluation by the senior judiciary, as you do not want to work from a law report that is considered to be an inferior report. The citations of a law case are also considered. The chapter also provides guidance on how to fnd secondary material. There is an enormous \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-6  \n\n--- Page 123 ---\n92 WORKING WITH THE LAW \n     \nrange of such materials and you need to understand the authority (if any) and the limits \nof the usefulness of any secondary material that you use. Students must keep up to date with academic thought about the area of law they are studying as well as keep up to date with the actual law itself if they want to achieve the highest grades. It also takes the time to consider how to check the authenticity, reliability and authority of free access internet resources. \nChapter 7 ‘How to read and understand domestic legislation’ focuses exclusively on \nlegislation, discussing the layout of legislation, and how to make sense of the format and language of statutory provisions. It also discusses the role of statutory interpretation in the development of ideas about the meaning of words and phrases used in legislation. It contains a survey which includes presumptions, linguistic aids to interpretation, the role of headings, margin notes within the statute and the use of external documentation (extrinsic aids) to discern the intention of the statute (e.g. explanatory notes, Hansard and other allowed policy documentation). \nChapter 8 ‘Reading and understanding cases’ focuses on how to understand the lan -\nguage of the judgments. It begins with an initial discussion of the doctrine of precedent, which is key to understanding the particular system judges adopt for reaching decisions in English cases. The doctrine maintains that if a similar case to one before a court has already been decided by the senior judiciary (in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court) then the case must be decided the same way by all courts (although the Supreme Court allows itself the limited practical ability to ignore an earlier similar decision of its own). This chapter also considers how to read a judgment, what to look out for, how to break into complex judicial language and how to write a good case note of a law report, and how to deal with a series of linked cases. \nBy the end of \nPart 2 you should have a good understanding of what is required to \nbecome a competent and successful legal scholar. You should be able to successfully navigate your university’s law library so as to locate the law and should feel confdent in your approach to handling and using primary and secondary law sources. This will be because you have developed a sound understanding of their construction, methods of interpretation and their language, an understanding you will continue to develop through\n-\nou\nt your law studies. \n\n--- Page 124 ---\n5 \n  \n           \n GENERAL STUDY \nSKILLS \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Appreciate the range of skills required to engage in competent study. \n  Understand the concept of learning and teaching styles, recognising which you \nprefer. \n  Identify ineffcient study habits and take action to avoid them. \n  Understand the structure of your degree programme and the cycles of academic life throughout the year and the term. \n  Appreciate how courses and modules make up parts of the degree programme. \n  Develop good independent learning habits. \n  Appreciate the need to acquire excellent ICT skills and develop a plan to acquire them. \n  Appreciate how to begin the process of personal development planning (PDP). \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-7  \n\n--- Page 125 ---\n   94 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nINTRODUCTION \nThis is a chapter designed to explain what study skills are, why you need them and how \nyou acquire and develop them. Students generally do not consider how they study. The action of studying itself requires the acquisition of general skills that increase your abil -\nity to develop your subject-specifc knowledge and understanding. In order to effciently learn, research, refect, read and produce competent assessments and examinations you need to know how  to study and how to self-manage your study. \nWhether you have gone to school before studying or whether you have worked, it is \nquite likely that you are facing a major transition at this stage. Until now, usually others were in charge of what you learnt, when you learnt it and how you learnt it. Now, lecturers typically only suggest readings or activities, and you will need to fnd your own ways to understand the topic. This is not because they do not care about you or are too lazy, but because they want you to become an independent learner. \nMany students still try to swim with the current and do not take the time to refect and \nto think about this transition. They see a university not as a life-changing intellectual chal -\nlenge but as a necessary evil that needs to be done before fnding a job, and they try to get through doing as little as possible. It is certainly possible to do that and to even obtain a degree, but these students will leave university ill-prepared for the future with a worry -\ning lack of self-awareness, and maybe a low degree classifcation that will not be of much use to them. Do not let your choices lead you in that direction. \nStudying is a highly disciplined enterprise and you, and no one else, are responsible \nfor the choices you make concerning when, or if, you study. To meet deadlines and pro -\nduce good quality assessments you need to allocate time in your weekly schedule to locate materials, date-plan for deadlines, internalise the content of your research, draft your assessments and submit them. Then when your assessments are returned you need to plan time to attentively read any constructive criticism given by your marker. \nYou should never be in the position of fnding the allocation of your assessment marks \n(whether good or bad) a mystery. Many students do not realise that not only can they increase their grades by reading and acting on their tutor’s comments about their work, they can book an appointment to speak to their tutor about how to improve their work, again increasing their ability to reach a higher level in their understanding. If you fail an assignment there is obviously room for improvement. If you get a 2.1 (60–69 per cent) there is still obvious room for improvement: you can aim to get a higher mark within the 2.1 range, or fnd out what you need to do to get a First. Even if you get a First, there might be things you can work on to ensure you maintain this level. You need to focus on the skills needed to allow you to develop understanding and how to elegantly express that under -\nstanding through well written (or spoken) arguments supported by reference to academic and legal texts, presented in appropriate English. \nThis chapter gives you time to consider your overall goals and how you will achieve \nthem. You may not have thought about your goals. Getting to university may have been a \n\n--- Page 126 ---\n    \n         \n  \n  GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 95 \ngoal; the tendency once you are there can be to make the mistake of not continuing to be \ngoal orientated concerning what you want to achieve in the short and long term. \nTo assist with your organisation skills, we will discuss the general cycles of the aca -\ndemic year, and we will give you suggestions concerning managing your lecture, seminar and independent study timetable, as well as your assessment or examination timetable. \nThis chapter highlights the importance of understanding your law school’s preferred \nor mandatory communication protocols. It discusses appropriate ways of communicating with your tutors and fellow students as well as the importance of developing competency in the use of IT systems such as email, virtual learning environments (VLEs), internet searching and word-processing. \nTo assist your navigation of this chapter it has been divided into the following main \nsections: \n  What are your goals? \n  What is studying? \n  How to engage in effective independent study. \n  The importance of working with the teaching programme and the cycles of the stand -\nard university year. \n  The range of skills required for successful legal study. \nWhat are your goals? \nThis is the time to consider the studies ahead of you. \nActivity 9.1: what are your goals? \n1) Think about the following questions: \n Why are you at university? \n What do you want to achieve? \n How will you achieve it? \n2) Write down your answers to the three questions in (1) above and keep them in mind as you read this chapter. Also fle them somewhere safe. You may need to remind yourself of your answers if you hit times of demotivation or lose self-confdence. Also they will need revision as you progress through the three years of your degree. They will certainly form the general core of any formal personal development planning that you are required, or you choose, to undertake. \nWHAT IS STUDYING? \nStudents often think of studying as a passive process of soaking up and memorising what is handed out by the teacher. However, in fact studying is an active pursuit, and it is about \n\n--- Page 127 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  96 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nlearning about learning: learning about yourself, learning about your chosen academic \nsubject area and learning how to learn. \nThe Shorter Oxford English Dictionary  notes that the root of the English word ‘study’ \nis based on the Latin word ‘ studium ’ meaning ‘zeal, painstaking application’. It goes on to \ndefne study in several helpful ways as: \n  ‘Thought … directed towards the accomplishment of a purpose’.1 \n  ‘Application of the mind to the acquisition of learning … mental effort in the acquisi -\ntion of learning’.2 \nFar from being a passive matter, study is dynamic and interactive. To study is to be know -\ningly engaged in the proactive process of searching for other ideas, weighing up possibili -\nties and alternatives, criticising and evaluating. \nYour role as a student is derived from the word ‘study’, with the Shorter Oxford English \nDictionary  defning a student as ‘a person who is engaged in or addicted to study’.3 \nIt is important therefore to spend time considering the range of skills required for your \ndegree study. Active study enables you to learn. \nStudying law at university \nMany students beginning study at university fnd their new-found freedom strange, dif -\nfcult to cope with and easy to get lost in. Those arriving at university having been previ -\nously in employment or running a household will have been used to their weeks being \nstructured around the requirements of others. Those arriving directly from school will be familiar with having their education highly structured by others on a daily basis. Mature students may think that university will be a little like their memories of school (both good and bad). \nAt university you will be taught in large and small groups. Your standard large group \nwill be a lecture with typically 100–300 other students, and the smaller groups (seminars or tutorials) are often run by a different teacher, in many universities a research student. In these circumstances not only does the lecturer not know you personally, but they also probably never will. You may be on a course where some small learning groups of fve to eight students are student-led, and you will only see the tutor when you are formally assessed on the presentation of your thoughts from those student-led seminars. \nA law degree is often seen as a dry and boring programme of study to those who do \nnot know much about it. But the study of law will touch your imagination and provoke your emotions. You will learn how to exercise and make judgments concerning legal issues and to constantly engage with legal rules, ideas, theories, concepts and critiques. You will be taught to locate the assumptions on which ideas or theories are based, and to critically question these assumptions. You will need to develop an enquiring mind, one that is fexible and can take on new ideas and critically evaluate them in line with your views. \n1 C T Onions, Shorter Oxford English Dictionary  (3rd edition, reprinted and revised, 1988) Vol 11, 2159. \n2 Ibid. \n3 Ibid, 2158. \n\n--- Page 128 ---\n    \n GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 97 \nIn order that you can reach a place of complex and sophisticated comprehension of \nthe topic you are studying, you need to be constantly seeking to understand and decode \nwhat you are reading and then consider competing interpretations. You need to know what you think of the ideas of others, and to justify the decisions you make about their strengths and weaknesses. \nWHAT IS LEARNING? \nThe purpose and outcome of study is learning and learning itself can be defned as the obtaining of knowledge about a skill or an art through personal study, reference to per -\nsonal experience and teaching.\n4 If your study skills are inadequate, your learning (and \ntherefore your knowledge and understanding) will be less competent than they may have been if you had displayed good study skills. Some students will say that they ‘hate study -\ning’. This is far too general and muddles process with substance. They may hate law, not the process of learning law. \nHow do you like to learn? \nYour personality has a major impact on how you learn so recognising some things about yourself and your learning will be of tremendous beneft. \nStop reading for a moment and think about how you approach the task of learning and \nwhy you study in a particular way. Did you positively choose that way of studying? \nYou may think that you do not have a particular way of learning: you just learn. You \nread books, go to taught classes and write some notes, remember them and complete assignments and exams. But there is far more to learning. You need to process your read -\ning and critique it. To do this you require good strategies for effective learning. \nStudents have different preferences for learning, such as being: \n  given all necessary information and memorising it; \n  left to work alone to fnd out information for themselves. \nStudents also have different purposes for studying which predetermine the skills they need, for example, only being interested in: \n  grades and the skill needed for the best grades; \n  doing the bare minimum to get a pass whilst they enjoy a great social life; \n  doing what they can to achieve both a good degree and a balanced social life. \nIf you are going to make a choice, make sure you are informed about the consequences \nof your choices. Maybe you have never considered that you have learning styles or preferences. \n4 C T Onions (ed) The Shorter Oxford Dictionary on Historical Principles  (3rd edition, Clarendon Press, \nOxford, 1988 revision and reprint) Vol 1, 1191. \n\n--- Page 129 ---\n   \n  \n \n    \n \n \n 98 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nLearning styles \nAccording to learning theorists, there are several different learning styles or preferences \nand many people have several learning styles or preferences depending on the tasks they are performing. Finding out which method or methods you prefer will give you your preferred learning style, and this will assist you in getting the most out of your independ -\nent learning time. \nBelow you will fnd three sets of learning style tables ( Tables 5 .1– 5.3) that have been \ndescribed by three different educational theorists ( Table 5 .1: Stella Cottrell,\n5 Table 5 .2: \nDavid Kolb6 and Table 5 .3: Peter Honey and Alan Mumford7). As you read each one \nTABLE 5.1 COTTRELL ’S LEARNING STYLES \nLearning \nstyle Description \nVisual Most happy learning from written information, diagrams and pictures. If they cannot take notes they will be stressed or de-motivated. Some visual learners will take their own notes even when they have been given pre-prepared ones. Written assessment works extremely well for visual learners. Some theorists split this group into those who relate best to print, and those who relate best to pictures, graphs and diagrams. Over half the population would fall into this learning style. \nAuditory Work best with oral skills. They like to listen to lectures, and may not take notes or write anything at all until after the lecture. If they see written information it will not make much sense until it is heard. One way in which this group fnds it easier to learn is to read aloud from their notes and books. Auditory learners can be particularly good speakers. About one-third of the population fall into this category. \nKinaesthetic This style involves effcient learning through movement and/or touching. It relates to practical application such as watching others do something and then repeating it. Kinaesthetic learners are often thought particularly slow in grasping information, but this is only because popular teaching styles favour visual learners and, to a lesser extent, auditory learners. They may go to different physical places to memorise different information, classifying it in their head according to the place. Or they may pace or jog whilst learning. Very few people rely on kinaesthetic learning as their only preferred learning style. \nInteractive Like to learn through discussion with peers and teachers. This style is particularly well suited to small group learning. Many students will say that they enjoy learning this way, but if it is not backed up by notes of the session made by the student the learning can be lost. \n5 S Cottrell The Study Skills Handbook  (3rd edition, Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, 2008). \n6 D Kolb Experiential Learning  (Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliff, 1984). \n7 P Honey and A Mumford The Manual of Learning Styles (Peter Honey, Maidenhead, 1992), 5. \n\n--- Page 130 ---\n    \n \n   \n GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 99 \nTABLE 5.2 KOLB’S LEARNING STYLES \nLearning style Description \nAccommodators Are characterised by their ability to plan and to execute the plan. They \nare prepared to take risks, and get involved in new experiences, and are extremely able to adapt to new situations. They are not afraid to throw away theories that clearly do not ft the situations they see, and they have an instinctively intuitive ability to jump straight to the solution to a problem without following a step-by-step problem-solving methodology. They also rely extensively on gathering information from others. Whilst accommodators are socially relaxed they can be perceived as bossy or lacking in patience. \nDivergers Utilise their imagination to view situations from a range of different perspectives. They are good at any activity that requires the creation of sets of ideas, such as brainstorming. They are social, and tend to pursue their academic interests in the areas of the arts. \nConvergers Have a much stronger skill in the area of practical application of ideas. They are particularly good at locating answers when only one solution is correct. They tend to enjoy technical tasks, and excel at problem-solving. \nAssimilators Have a major strength in the area of theoretical models. They can look at a range of seemingly disconnected facts and give an integrated explanation, if there is one to be found. They enjoy logical thought and, if a theory does not ft, they will carefully review the facts and seek another theory. \nconsider if you use this style, or now you know about it would you consider using it? You \nwill notice that several styles have similar features. \nCottrell’s learning styles \nCottrell outlined four key learning styles: visual, auditory, kinaesthetic and interactive, which are described in Table 5 .1. \nPeople tend to use the above preferences together when engaging in simple tasks \nsuch as rote learning. Verbal memory can be enhanced by uniting it with visual memory. Making notes and using differing colours to highlight, or using different patterns in your note taking, increases your ability to remember the text. You can also utilise kinaes -\nthetic memory, for example, moving around and speaking aloud the text that you want to remember.\n8 \n8 S ome students may be concerned that they have a bad memory, or believe that as you get older your \nability to remember diminishes, and lose confdence. Mid-life memory loss is not substantiated by very \nmuch hard evidence. Mental processes do change  with age and speed is lost, but we develop effcient \nstrategies for the manipulation of data. Our application and understanding is enhanced. This more than \n\n--- Page 131 ---\n   \n   \n 100 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nTABLE 5.3 HONEY AND MUMFORD’S LEARNING STYLES \nLearning \nstyle Description \nActivists Prefer to learn ‘by doing’, so that their learning is based on experience. This is similar to Kolb’s converger, and Cottrell’s kinaesthetic learner. They are extremely open to new ways of doing things, but this can foster a tendency to be always moving on to new experiences. Activists can be easily seduced into thinking that the actual experience is the learning (which it is not). Experience cannot be turned into learning without refection. \nRefectors These are happy learning by observation, researching materials, reading them, refecting on them and reaching conclusions. What can be a problem for these students is the tendency to collect too much information, making it diffcult to reach a conclusion. \nTheorists Work best when constructing theories (explanations as to why something is as it is). They like to think things through logically, organising their views into theories like Kolb’s assimilators. They can, on the negative side, jump to conclusions too quickly without taking care to refect critically on their material and fndings. \nPragmatist Learn by translating what they know, whatever that may be, into practical experience, which they experiment with in a range of situations. This is again similar to Kolb’s assimilator. This preference for practical experience can also bring with it a tendency to jump to conclusions prior to the outcome of the analysis. \nKolb’s learning styles \nKolb classifes four main learning styles: the accommodator, converger, diverger and \nassimilator, which are set out in Table 5 .2. \nHoney and Mumford’s learning styles \nHoney and Mumford, whose work was much infuenced by Kolb, also identify four main learning styles: activist, refector, theorist and pragmatist, as indicated in Table 5 .3. \nWhich learning style should you use, and should you stick to one? \nMany learners only use one method of learning but educators consider that there is a bene -\nft in trying all learning styles because different learning styles can be more, or less, suitable \nmakes up for the loss of speed which is hardly noticeable! The issue is how much the brain is used  rather \nthan the age of the user . To remember is to involve oneself in an active process. \n\n--- Page 132 ---\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 101 \nfor different learning situations. For example, if we stay with Honey and Mumford ( Table 5 .3), \nthe activist style is particularly useful when searching for data, such as the primary sources \nof law, law cases, legal rules and texts. Once data is retrieved you may fnd it more useful to adopt the refector style, which is extremely productive for considering the tasks to be done (such as sorting, classifying and time-management). The pragmatist learning style is excellent when replicating learnt techniques and is therefore suitable for practising worked examples such as methods of problem-solving. The theorist learning style is excellent for working towards understanding objectives and information, leading to summarising. \nActivity 5.2: fnding out your learning style \nUse Table 5 .4 to tick the learning styles that you think you currently use and also the \nstyles that you think you would like to try. You can then make an effort to incorporate your chosen styles into your developing study strategies. You do not have to remember any labels. This is just a simple activity to highlight your existing learning styles and take the opportunity to experiment. \nWhy should you know your learning style? \nKnowing your learning preferences is important because you will encounter lecturers and tutors who present different teaching methods and your preferred learning style may not be useful to you. You can use different learning styles to cope with the different teaching methods you will encounter, for example: \n  Lecturers will use oral presentation, PowerPoint slides, handouts, videos and audio \nclips to share information with you. \n  Lecturers will give you reading. \n  Your seminar or tutorial leaders will use small groups to engage in discussions and role-plays. You will be asked to engage in investigative research. \nYou need to take as much as you can from all of these learning opportunities, regardless of your preferred style. University legal education relies heavily on lectures by the presen -\ntation of auditory information. If this is not your preferred learning style, then you need to consider what skills you must develop to ensure that you can learn from such presenta -\ntions. If you need to learn from purely visual information and you naturally prefer auditory, again you need to consider how you can adapt to learn from this situation. \nWHAT IS INDEPENDENT STUDY? \nStudents arrive at university through many different routes: straight from school, after a gap year or sometimes a long time after they ceased formal education of any description. \n\n--- Page 133 ---\n     102 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nTABLE 5.4 WHAT IS YOUR STYLE OF LEARNING, AND WHAT ARE YOU WILLING TO TRY?\nLEARNING STYLES BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF LEARNING STYLE YES: this \nis me NO: this is not me DON’T KNOW I MIGHT TRY THIS \nCOTTRELL\nVISUAL You like to deal with visual information (writing, \ndiagrams, pictures).

However, in the absence of supportive evidence, you have a habit of jumping to conclusions and this must be guarded against. \nTHE PRAGMATIST You like to translate knowledge into practical experience. \n\n--- Page 135 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 104 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nBoth those arriving from school and those attending university as mature students do so \nwith some expectation that it will be similar to the patterns of school life. Nearly all stu -\ndents are surprised by the expectation that they engage in many hours of independent study a week. If one assumes a learning week of 35 hours for a full-time student during the two main teaching terms of the academic year they will spend at least 66 per cent of their time engaged in independent study. This statistic remains relative for a student studying part time as they pursue other activities during the week. \nLife at university allows you the freedom to explore books and electronic learning \nresources – to prepare when you wish, and to discuss ideas with your peer group. We live in an age of ‘lifelong learning’ where more and more people of all ages become students either full time or part time, formally through structured degree programmes or more informally through MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and other dis -\ntance learning provisions. What they each have in common is that all students have to seize all of the learning opportunities offered and self-manage their own path through them. \nThroughout the course of your law degree, independent studying will involve prepara -\ntion for seminars or tutorials; engaging with pre-set questions and set reading; research -\ning discussion topics; or completing coursework assignments, reports or presentations for formal assessment. \nYour lecturers and seminar or tutorial leaders are generally academics who are not \nonly teachers but are working on their own research and producing publications. Their role is to guide you through their module, giving you a blueprint to use to set the bounda -\nries for you to determine your own independent study. This is an extremely different sce -\nnario from school organisation, where the teacher primarily teaches and pupils usually have exclusively taught classes and are expected to do directed home-based work out of school. \nA required skill of the graduating university student is that they should demonstrate \nthat they have developed a strong personal independency. This is seen as the marker of ‘graduate-ness’. Employers will certainly be looking for evidence of this. The UK Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (the body that checks to ensure universities maintain their own academic standards and quality) require it to be instilled in students. One way of demonstrating that you have this skill is to have good habits of independent study. It is not only essential for your academic and vocational education but also in the legal profession, organising the handling of their client’s fle. \nHOW TO DEVELOP HABITS OF INDEPENDENT STUDY \nIndependent learning involves the development of self-discipline: we are all different; you must not be concerned by others and their plans (or lack of them). You only need to concern yourself with you. You need to take time and decide what works best for you in terms of learning. \n\n--- Page 136 ---\n    GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 105 \nTime-management skills are essential for your development of good learning habits. \nConsider for a moment if you have a good track record of organising your time to get \nthings done. In the past your teacher, your employer or your family may have given you a structure for planning your work. At university you will have to learn to do this for yourself, structuring task completion and also prioritising among tasks. \nThe effcient management of your independent study requires that you obtain the full \nrange of information relating to being able to effciently study, which includes information on: \n  your modules (syllabus/module outline, reading lists, handbooks, set texts); \n  all assessment submission dates; \n  your weekly/fortnightly/termly timetable of taught classes; \n  term dates and the organisation of the academic year; \n  using your department’s virtual learning environment; \n  using required IT (including word-processing packages); \n  how to competently use the library; \n  development of your English language skills and the ascertainment of your strengths \nand weaknesses. \nOnce you have pulled all of this information together, you will need to prioritise your time in terms of lecture attendance, seminar preparation, attendance and participation in sem -\ninars, submission of coursework, revision and taking exams. \nAlways be aware of your own study priorities on a daily and weekly basis by keeping \nan organised digital or print diary. Look ahead and plan out the term, noting when assess -\nments are set and when they are due for submission. \nBeing well organised in your management of class attendance, independent study and \ncoursework submission will help ensure that you do not experience high stress levels. \nTHE CYCLES PATTERNS AND SCHEDULES OF \nSTANDARD UNIVERSITY STUDY \nIt is necessary to understand the organisation of your degree through all of its years, as \nwell as the divisions of the academic year into terms or semesters. You cannot success -\nfully manage your learning if you do not know the patterns of life at your university, what is expected of you and when it is expected. \nThe pattern of your degree \nFull-time students usually complete their studies within three years, although if place -\nments or time abroad is involved it can be four years. Part-time students usually take up to six years to complete their degrees, made up of two years of part-time study for each \n\n--- Page 137 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 106 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nfull-time year of study. But students may be able to complete a part-time degree sooner. \nMany universities will allow a part-time student to study full time for part of the degree if the student is able to do so. \nModules \nEach year you will take a range of modules and obtain credits at certain grades; these determine your degree result. In many universities, year 1 grades do not count towards the calculation of the fnal degree grade, but that may not be the case for all degrees. An often overlooked but important task for students is to understand how many mod -\nules are required for the completion of their degree, and which are compulsory and optional. \nYou should aim to make links between the various modules on your degree course, \nrather than moving from one module to another without any regard for what has gone before. For some modules such as employment law you will be required to draw on con -\ncepts learnt in previous years in the law of contract and law of tort modules. Similarly, make links between each individual topic within each module, seeing them as parts of a whole, and consider them in the context of other issues, such as social scientifc analysis of law as well as legal analysis. \nEach module that you study throughout your degree will carry a set number of cred -\nits towards your degree, with a degree being made up of 360 credits. Each year of your degree is therefore worth 120 credits and each course or module you study will contribute a specifc number of credits to that total. \nUniversities have different systems on how many credits each module is worth, \nand this will be based on the number of hours they expect students on a module. You might have some modules worth 20 credits (often optional modules), some modules worth 10 credits (often introductory modules) and some modules worth 40 credits (complex core modules like the law of contract), but all of this varies from university to university. \nYou will be required to complete a set number of compulsory courses or modules each \nyear. Options usually have to be chosen in the induction week, if not before. Your choices here are important for a number of reasons. If you have a clear idea of the career path you want to follow after your studies (for example, you may want to practise corporate or commercial law), you may choose modules that are more closely aligned with that path. When you have ascertained what your optional modules are you should consider them carefully before making your choice. \nIt is also important that you do a bit of research on what you need to do to qualify \nas a lawyer (if that is what you want). You might need to take specifc options to fulfl the requirements laid down by the professions – either because your university offers a non-qualifying route as the default, or because you might want to qualify in a different common law jurisdiction where you need to have done modules that are not compulsory in your university (some African common law jurisdictions, for example, require the law of \n\n--- Page 138 ---\n    \n \n  GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 107 \nevidence). Unfortunately, there are a lot of required options for a qualifying law degree. \nWith these added to the compulsory modules your university requires you to do, there is often not a lot of choice left. \nThe cycle of the academic year \nThe academic year is usually organised according to terms or semesters. Terms split the academic year into three terms of 11–12 weeks separated by vacations; the semester sys -\ntem splits the academic year into two semesters of around 16–18 weeks, again separated by vacation. The total number of weeks of university teaching is therefore in the region of 33–36 weeks. Some university departments hold exams at the end of each term or semester, others at the end of the academic year. \nHowever, university teaching rarely extends beyond weeks 22–24 of these teaching \nweeks, as time is set aside for revision and examinations. Generally, all of the teaching and learning is squashed into the 22 weeks between September/October and March/ April, a period that also includes around seven weeks of vacation time. The reality is that you are only taught for around six months of the year. \nFirst-year students can easily fail to get into proper study habits and independent \nlearning until January or February by which time the taught year is half over and several modules are completed. In departments where modules are only one term in length, students who take weeks to acclimatise upon arrival can fnd they are failing because they did not even realise modules ended in December: they thought they had more time to improve. \nEach of these front-loaded 22–24 weeks contains lectures and seminars and in many \nweeks there will be assessment submission deadlines. It is this yearly pattern that deter -\nmines the fow of your taught classes, independent study and free time. \nConsideration of the pattern of your taught classes and assessments as well as vaca -\ntions (when you will fnd you still need to be studying) allows you to see where you have spaces for independent study as well as gathering work experience, doing paid employ -\nment if necessary and to recover. \nIt is equally important to understand the rhythm of your term/semester cycle and the \ntimetable of weekly lectures, seminars and assessments. You will need to organise your study outside the classroom for seminars and assessments as well as increasing your general understanding of the subject. The discussion that follows discusses the termly pattern, as shown in Figure 5.1, but it can be adapted very easily to slot into the semester \npattern if your institution uses it. \nZooming into this cycle in more detail, Table 5 .5 sets out the months of the year and \nmaps them against the standard academic activity taking place, so you can begin to see the rhythm of the academic year for the typical student. Not all university departments will have the same pattern, but they will be similar. This will reinforce the comment above that you do not actually have a year to study; at best you have nine months. Of this time, only around six months will be spent with teachers in lectures and seminars. \n\n--- Page 139 ---\n   \n \n \n  108 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nVACATION \n3 – 4 weeks TERM 1 \n11 – 12 weeks \nTeaching \nVACATION \n11 – 12 weeks TERM 2 \nThen the next 11 – 12 weeks \nyear starts!

The next section looks \nat this micro-context and also engages in a discussion of personal management within the termly and weekly cycle. It is here, at the detailed level, that you are most likely to struggle. \nPlanning your weekly and yearly timetable \nIt is essential that you plan your timetable carefully, and that you plan for appropriate self-study time right from the beginning. \nContrary to school, the chances are that you will be able to get through your classes \nas a passive listener without preparing. However, if you do this, you are going to face a very stressful time preparing for your assessments and exams, and your performance is almost certainly going to suffer. In the worst cases the mixture between under- and over -\nwork can have serious consequences for your mental health. \nIf you are a full-time student and have other responsibilities – family, part-time work – a \ngood plan is absolutely essential for your success. Depending on your preferences, this could either be in a paper-based diary (just make sure it is small enough so you can carry it everywhere) or in one of the many online calendar solutions that you can also view and use on your phone. \n\n--- Page 140 ---\n      \n \n \n \n GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 109 TABLE 5.5 TYPICAL ACADEMIC CYCLE FOR A YEAR 1 STUDENT ON A DEGREE DIVIDED INTO TERMS\nMONTHS OFFICIAL ACTIVITY STUDENT TASKS WEEKS \nSEPT TERM 1: INDUCTION MAYBE \nSTART OF TEACHING This is a whirlwind time of highs and lows for most students.

If relevant, go away from the university for a few weeks to revise when revision classes have ended. Everyone is different and you must do what is best for you.

Then have a look at your \nmodule handbooks for the recommended independent study hours. These are typically \na good representation of what you are going to need to do for succeeding in a particular module. Then arrange and add your paid employment (if you are doing part-time work). Finally, make sure that you have some free time left for recreation and things you enjoy doing! It is extremely important – not only for yourself, but also for your performance on the degree – that you get some time to rest in addition to studying. \nAnother thing to look out for from the beginning is the other activities in your law \nschool and in the wider community – your law school might have mooting competitions, a law society, a law newsletter, a law clinic or many other extra-curricular opportunities. You might be able to volunteer at organisations like Citizens Advice or for an NGO. All of these activities are incredibly important. Law is a very competitive profession, and an engagement with the law that goes beyond going to classes and completing assess -\nments is almost required these days. Employers want to see that you really care about the topic and that you devote time and energy to it. Volunteering and engaging with other law students or lawyers also is a great motivator and keeps reminding you why you are doing all this when you are struggling to revise for a particularly diffcult exam. Make sure to add time for activities like this – whether it is one hour on Wednesday afternoon for your law newsletter meeting or several weeks in summer for work experience. \nAs mentioned before, many universities do not count the frst-year results into the \ndegree classifcation. This leads some students to take a more relaxed stance in that year, a strategy that is almost certain to backfre: it is far more diffcult to change your habits in year 2 than to create new habits in year 1. In addition, future employers will often want to look at your entire transcript. If you apply for a placement or a training contract in a frm specialising in criminal law, for example, the recruiter will not be overly excited about a low mark in your criminal law module – whether that was in year 3 or 1. \nMany management consultants additionally advise that crisis time is built into your \nstandard timetable planning. These are hours that are ‘free’ but ‘in-waiting’: in case you cannot study at the time allotted you can use a crisis-time bloc. There may also be a read -\ning week or independent study week each mid-term when there is no teaching, allowing you to catch up, though this is not the case in all departments. The vacations also allow you some space to have a break as well as catch up with study or work on assessments that may be due. \nTHE RANGE OF SKILLS REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL LEGAL STUDY \nTable 5 .6 sets out the wide range of skills that you need to develop for successful legal \nstudy. Do read these carefully; they are all interrelated and, when taken together, impact your learning. \nYou will by now realise that it is fatal to underestimate the importance of general study \nskills, and that your competent study requires competent English language skills, legal \n\n--- Page 143 ---\n   \n  \n \n \n \n  112 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nTABLE 5.6 THE SKILLS REQUIRED FOR THE SUCCESSFUL STUDY OF \nLAW \nStudy skills How to develop independent and highly effcient learning strategies, \nincluding effcient fling systems, which will tend to be both digital and hard copy. \nIT skills Effcient use of email, word-processing, being able to navigate virtual learning environments, competent internet search, e-library use, database manipulation. You will fnd plenty of online training materials and help on your university’s web pages. \nCommunication skills The ability to clearly and appropriately communicate with staff and fellow students in writing and orally. Competent understanding of the use of electronic communication in your department. \nLanguage skills Competent understanding and use of general English and technical legal language. This requires a good grasp of vocabulary, grammar, punctuation and spelling. The quality of your language skills determines the effectiveness of your communication. \nCritical thinking skills The ability to constantly question, seeking the underlying assumptions behind arguments, taking nothing for granted, seeking evidence for your assertions, questioning your own positions. \nLegal research skills How to fnd law and texts about law through highly effective library search skills. \nLegal method skills Understanding strategies for fnding, analysing and applying the law. \nArgumentative skills Identifcation, construction and evaluation of the argument. \nReading skills How to read legal texts by engaging in active reading for sense; looking for markers in the text to aid reading; scanning for information; appreciating different methods of reading. \nWriting skills Writing effcient notes, summaries, essays, legal problem solutions, exams, reports and more. \nSpeaking (oral) skills Being able to competently engage in debating, mock trials (mooting), mediation, negotiation, presentation. \nSubstantive law Legal knowledge, for example, of criminal law, contract law and so on. \nmethod skills, critical thinking skills and argument construction skills. You will not achieve \nyour potential without engaging with these sets of skills. \nIt is essential to realise that defciency in one group of skills can affect your perfor -\nmance in all areas, and therefore affect your grades. You may have a good ability to \n\n--- Page 144 ---\n    GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 113 \nargue, but you cannot express this competently in writing using grammatically correct \nEnglish and using correct spellings. \nCompetent use of electronic communication \nGiven that we live in an age where cleaners post examples of their spotless work on their Instagram account and your corner-shop sends a weekly email newsletter to inform you that a type of chocolate bar is back in stock, you would think that electronic communica -\ntion does not need to be explained any more. Unfortunately, this is not true. Many stu -\ndents miss classes, submit wrong assessments or misunderstand seminar tasks simply because of mistakes with electronic communication. \nMake sure that you familiarise yourself with the ways your university and your teachers \ndisseminate information. In most universities, this will be with the use of a virtual learn -\ning environment (such as Moodle or Blackboard) and with email. It is important that you check this regularly – at least on a daily basis, and certainly before classes to check for last-minute changes. \nIt is also essential that you understand the structure of the VLE the university is using, \nso you can make full use of the material that your lecturer shares with you. This can be everything from discussion forum entries over a reading list to video lectures. \nMAKING THE BEST USE OF TEACHING \nIt is essential to properly use the offered teaching arrangements, which are planned to give you the opportunities to learn from your teachers. Standard practice for university teaching arrangements on law degree programmes is the use of large lectures, small group work in seminars or tutorials (mostly with tutors, sometimes led by students) and limited one to one sessions with your lecturers or tutors. \nSome students struggle to leave behind a teacher/pupil school mentality in both their \nexpectations of and relationships with teachers. The standard term for the university teacher is either lecturer or tutor. Some of your lecturers will be in charge of the modules they teach, having overall responsibility for their design, recommended reading and the construction of both assessments and the exam, if there is one. Often a module will have a teaching team of several lecturers, assisted by research students. Where a team of lecturers and tutors are involved the lecturer in charge of the module will consult them concerning assessment design etc. It is useful to be aware of these basics. \nWe will look at: \n  one to one learning opportunities with staff; \n  lectures; \n  seminars/tutorials. \n\n--- Page 145 ---\n   114 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nOne to one learning opportunities with staff \nThere are several types of one to one meeting you may have with lecturers or tutors: \n  personal tutor meetings; \n  a meeting with your subject lecturer or tutor pre-arranged by yourself or them; or \n  taking the opportunity to attend a ‘drop-in’ session during staff offce hours. \nWhatever the nature of the one to one session you need to go prepared, ensure you know \nwhat it is about in advance, listen in a focused manner during the meeting, remember what is said, make sense of it, note down important points and ensure you leave under -\nstanding what you need to do next. \nLecturer offce hours/drop-in hour \nMany lecturers/tutors have weekly offce hours on a ‘by-appointment’ or a drop-in basis when students can discuss issues surrounding their learning on the module. ‘By appoint -\nment’ means just that: prior to the offce hour you contact the lecturer/tutor using their preferred contact methods to arrange a meeting. \nThese offce hours are useful if you do not understand why you obtained a low grade \nfor assessment, or if you are having diffculties with any topic or sub-topic. Ensure you go to these one to one sessions knowing what your issues are. Make sure you prepare for your meeting and you have detailed questions – the time is limited, and working out what exactly you need help with can take a bit of time itself. \nIf you are discussing your assessment performance, you must re-read your work \nbefore you attend your session. Carefully re-read the question and consider the feedback given by your marker, linking it to your work and seeing if you understand what has been said. It is a waste of everyone’s time when a student arrives without bothering to engage in pre-thought and just says, ‘Why is my mark so low? I thought my essay was OK’. Lecturers will have marked hundreds of pieces of work, and although they may recall your grade band they will not necessarily recall their detailed feedback. Therefore it is always sensible to take a copy of your coursework and any feedback given to you. \nLectures \nLectures are delivered to facilitate student learning. However, they are not all uniform in their purpose. Some lectures are designed to inform you about the general framework of a large or smaller area of your module. Other lectures focus on specifc issues within a sub-topic of the overall module. The order in which lectures are delivered is carefully planned to give you the basic information you need to make sense of upcoming expected reading, seminar preparation and assessments. \nLectures can be thought of as a map of different areas, and are most defnitely a \nshortcut to understanding the basics. Note that we refer to the basics. No module can \n\n--- Page 146 ---\n    \n  GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 115 \nbe passed on lectures alone. You need to engage with the required reading and with \nseminars. If you choose not to attend, do not be surprised if this choice is refected in low assessment grades, and a continuing lack of understanding. \nYour active engagement with the lecture is vital. You may or may not wish to write \nlecture notes, but it is usually a good idea to note basics and then read more widely on the topic after the lecture. If PowerPoint slides are used, these can often be downloaded in advance and used for adding notes. \nSeminars/tutorials \nUsually, in addition to lectures, each module will have weekly or fortnightly tutor-led small groups, either called seminars or tutorials. Traditionally, there was a difference between the slightly larger and more structured seminars and the smaller tutorials, but most uni -\nversities use these terms interchangeably now. Typically, there will be between 20 and 30 students in a seminar. \nWhatever the nature of the small group work in your modules, pre-work will be involved \nand they will be led by a lecturer or tutor. At the end of all small group work, the tutor will draw your attention to any issues that should have been discussed and were omitted by you in your discussions. You are expected to take on board what is said in the small group and engage in any extra reading as you or the tutor consider necessary. It is a good idea to make sure that you leave each session with written notes relating to the correct approaches to the questions/tasks set. \nStudents often do not prepare at all or inadequately for these sessions, which is short -\nsighted as they take you deeper into the subject. You can test your understanding and check that you are on track in your views. So you will severely disadvantage yourself if you choose not to do the pre-set independent work. If you treat a seminar as a passive experience and expect the tutor to give you the required knowledge, you are not going to learn much from it. \nYour seminar management is an important part of your independent learning develop -\nment. If you neglect it, you will again fnd that your lack of understanding is refected in low assessment grades. At the end of a term, you will see that you remember a lot more from the discussions you were actively engaged in than from the content you passively consumed. \nWorking in groups with fellow students (formally and informally) \nThe development of interpersonal skills through team working is one of the essential skills of a competent graduate. But team working is often demanding and challenging. \nMany of you will have experienced some degree of team working prior to university, \nand it may have been a good or a bad experience. The fact is that success in life is very much down to your ability to engage at the appropriate time in competent interpersonal skills and to work as part of a team. In short, to get on with others, demonstrate you are \n\n--- Page 147 ---\n   116 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \na trustworthy team player, and demonstrate you can self-manage. These skills get you \nnoticed, and you can be judged accordingly. \nMany students working in teams or groups do not stop to consider the challenges \nof working with other people. They may feel angry (either passively or actively) or feel bullied, or they may themselves bully others. Notice that these are emotional issues. Emotions as well as lazy group members can demoralise other group members. Then the actual task they have to work on is de-prioritised whilst problems are resolved. It takes the development of good skills of listening and understanding, as well as appropriate levels of humility to respect the views of others. It takes self-discipline to prepare work for other students and to deal with those who are not pulling their weight. But if this is done you will learn to manage people effectively and allow them to think and develop, and this quality is highly regarded in employment (having lazy co-workers in your team is unfor -\ntunately not an issue limited to university). The quality of group work and discussion will then result in very good work. \nEFFECTIVE NOTE TAKING \nTaking notes \nMuch of your independent study time will involve note taking; it is one of the most impor -\ntant tasks you will engage in. Your note taking includes all of the written records that you have made of what you have heard and what you have read. \nThey are a major contributing factor to your learning, for you will use them to assimilate \nand integrate information, critique concepts from a range of sources and translate them into arguments for your formal written work. \nYou will take notes for many reasons, to: \n  Build up a body of materials that increases your knowledge. \n  Form the basis for constructing exam answers and written (or oral) assessments. \n  Help you express and understand concepts/ideas. \n  Store information in a classifed, ordered manner. \nYou will also take notes in different situations: \n  From your reading. \n  In lectures. \n  In seminars. \nIt is very easy to lose sight of appropriate length for notes and write far too much. A note \nis designed to quickly recall more information to your mind. You do not want to wade through a large pile of notes. It is also easy to write notes of irrelevant material if you do \n\n--- Page 148 ---\n    \n \n \n \n GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 117 \nnot apply your mind to the task at hand. Note taking, like reading, should be a dynamic \nand not a passive activity. \nCottrell9 suggests that asking the following questions can help you to decide what to note. \n  Do you really need this information? If so, which bits? \n  Will you really use it? When, and how? \n  Have you noted similar information already? \n  What questions do you want to answer with this information? \nYou also need to know how to use your notes by: \n  Interconnecting your notes from lectures, seminars, books and articles using a reli -\nable fling system. \n  Using your notes effectively in your written work. \nNote taking presents you with many challenges. You may fnd that:   You make notes from a lot of background reading, but are then stuck when it comes \nto using them for your written work. \n  You may feel overwhelmed in lectures; what do you note? Especially when every word seems factual and/or the lecturer is speaking too quickly for you to note. However, whilst in some schools teachers dictate notes, a lecturer is not dictating; they are speaking about the subject for you to note what you wish in view of handouts, read -\ning and visual aids used in the lecture theatre. \n  You read slowly and feel you cannot follow the sense of a text and write notes, and the notes you make are too detailed. As a consequence you fear that your note taking takes you far too long. \n  After you have made a great deal of notes for an assessment you do not know which words are yours and which you copied out of the text directly, and fnd you are strug -\ngling because you now do not know if the ideas in them are yours or another writer’s; this causes you to worry about falling into accidental plagiarism.  An easy way to avoid this is to give the title of the text and full reference as a header before you begin taking notes. Then make a note of any specifc page you are noting. If you quote verbatim from a text in your notes ensure you use quotation marks. If you are summarising a set of ideas again clearly note whose ideas they are and the page number where they can be located. By giving the full reference and title of every text you note, you also have the ability to quickly construct a sources list or bibliography for your writing. \n By noting specifc pages from the text in your notes it makes it easy to return to that place in the text maybe weeks later because your knowledge has increased and you now think that other information around that page could be important for your work. \n9 S Cottrell The Study Skills Handbook  (2nd edition, Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, 2003), 126. \n\n--- Page 149 ---\n   \n \n \n \n 118 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nStrategies for note taking \nAlways approach note taking by being clear about your purpose for noting. This should \nbe easy enough for reading tasks if you are following a reading strategy and are reading for a purpose. Given your purpose when you fnd texts of relevance you need to briefy cover the core facts or arguments, and to do so briefy. Long notes are no use to you. \nYou do not have to write your notes; you could consider underlining and highlighting \nwords or phrases in your book that seem to be the core of the point being made. Only do this on your own books. If you do not want to write in your own books, you could record the main headings in the text and give a few keywords in your notes about each chapter. \nAs you are reading and noting it is normal for questions or thoughts about the text to \narise in your mind, and it is a good idea to record them in your notes. Your recorded good idea may be very useful for your later written work. Or they can prompt you to engage in more reading as follow up. \nIf it is possible write your notes on one side of paper only, and then you can add in \nmaterial covering the same area from other reading that you undertake later. When you have read a section it is a good idea to summarise it; the advice is to stop reading and take a few seconds to think about what you have just read and then summarise it in your own words, noting page numbers, and the author of any ideas. Then read back over the text to double-check you did not miss any important points. \nThe structure of notes \nYou want to see at a glance core points, summaries, references, headings and subhead -\nings, and leave space to add in more information as you read and refect on your develop -\ning understanding. \nThere are several ways that you can approach note taking and you need to be guided \nby the method(s) that suit you best, as the notes are for your beneft alone. You will soon learn the method you prefer. Some students fnd they use a variety of methods to suit the purpose of their note taking. We will look at the use of: \n  Linear text. \n  Diagrams. \n  Mind maps. \nLinear text \nThe majority of people use this method of writing notes. This involves writing notes in a \nsentence form or bullet point form in the order that you are reading the text. If you use this method it is a good idea to get into the habit of using abbreviations. These should be kept short however, or you will become lost in detail. \n\n--- Page 150 ---\n    \n  GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 119 \nstress     reading \nlibrary \nRESEARCH spell \nWORRY ! note s ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLS write \nSTUDY SKILL \nread \nLECTURES/SEMINARS \nLEARNING \nGO! \nconcentra\u000bon STUD Y \nFigure 5.2 Example spray diagram using the keyword ‘STUDY’ \nSpray diagrams \nThese operate on keywords that you have identifed in the text. The keyword is put in \nthe middle of the page and circled. Then you think of words that are connected to this keyword; these words could relate to concepts, facts, etc. They provide a way for you to think more extensively about smaller sections of text. \nFor an example we have taken the keyword ‘study’. As you can see the diagram is random and is only as good as your thoughts. You cer -\ntainly need to know why you are creating the diagram or the exercise is unhelpful. But you can then see simultaneously areas where there are a lot of links and those where there are few. In academic terms you could do this looking at your essay as a whole, noting gaps in your argument to support propositions. \nMind maps \nThese look at frst glance to be a spray diagram; however, there is a frmer patterning to the links, and they are more structured – see Figure 5 .3. \n\n--- Page 151 ---\n   \n \n \n  \n \n  120 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nMethod s to reduce stress  Reading strategies \nGood library skills \nEFFICIENT RESEARCH Grammar \nWORRY !

However, for verbal presentations such as lec -\ntures, speeches, seminars and videos, note taking presents different challenges. \nThe presentation you are listening to may be disorganised, which again creates dif -\nfculties for you. But even a well-organised presentation in a lecture requires you to engage in active listening skills (the note taking side of active reading skills). Active listening requires you to ask questions in your mind as you are listening and simultane -\nously noting. As you can imagine this skill of doing three things at once takes time to develop. \nStudents do ask lecturers to repeat points, but it is often not looked upon too kindly. \nUsually lecturers in the university use PowerPoint slides which are posted on the VLE before the lecture. It is a good idea to print these out using the three slide note taking option format in black and white to keep costs low. You can then write notes beside each \n\n--- Page 152 ---\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 121 \nslide as they are presented in the lecture and discussed. Just record key points and if \nreferences are mentioned that are not on the slide, note them. Equally if information is on the slide do not repeat it in your note. \nAfter the lecture just make sure that you have an effcient method for highlighting fur -\nther reading, any tasks you have been asked to do and fle your notes. You might fnd that using different pens helps you identify areas you need to follow up for more information or where you need to spend time trying to understand the point made. Read (or just fick through) a book on the subject of the lecture. Look for themes, issues, topics and head -\nings. Lookup any technical words you don’t understand. \nQuestions arising in your mind as you write notes \nIf questions arise as you write notes put them in the notes either in another colour or on the back of the page of notes so that you can explore them more fully. If you do not write them down, you will forget them and they are key to your development. Any of the follow -\ning matters may arise in your mind: \n  an idea about a link to other issues; \n  wondering if an interpretation other than the one you have read is better; \n  a reference to follow up; \n  some limitations that you think what you are reading may have, but you need to \ncheck; \n  some questions that your reading is raising in your mind; \n  statistics that you need to look up. \nPERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING \nIn academic life, both at school and university as well as professional life, personal development plans, or PDPs, are of increasing importance. We have already referred above to goals. A PDP assists you to develop towards your goals in a more formal manner. At root it involves stopping to think about your learning and how you are devel -\noping in your studies, including your good achievements such as assessment marks and engaging in department or national competitions in law. It also involves planning your development at university and beyond from a personal, academic and career perspective. \nUsually, a part of your department’s VLE will be devoted to PDP and will guide you \nthrough the process. Building a PDP is a useful process because it allows you to develop focus. If you want to obtain a scholarship or to ensure a place at a good university for a master’s degree or PhD, or to have a good chance at a start in the professions, you will need a 2.1 or a First. Often you need to demonstrate achievements outside the academic \n\n--- Page 153 ---\n   122 GENERAL STUDY SKILLS \nbut related, such as relevant volunteering, internships or placements. So knowing this, \nit is not a good idea to miss lectures and seminars, attain low grades and be generally careless in your approach to studies. Nor is it a good idea to just do the basics and not seek placements, etc. \nPDP will help you to develop plans to develop independent learning, increase your \ngrades or engage in extra-curricular activity. As you engage with the process you will fnd you become increasingly aware of your strengths and weaknesses in all areas. You will realise what you can change and then seek to identify specifc skills sets that need development. Your tutors will be only too pleased to assist with your academic-related development. \nThe formal process of PDP encourages you to keep a note of your achievements, \nand these are useful references when you are constructing a CV for further study or employment. \nStudents who have engaged in PDP maintain it is extremely useful for keeping them \nfocused, and look at their learning preferences to understand why they have them and why it may be a good idea to try other learning styles. The more you engage in PDP in a fexible manner, the more you genuinely take over the management of your present and future, and take rather than miss opportunities. \nMany law degree programmes integrate PDP into your skills training, as well as pro -\nviding opportunities for work-based learning. All of these matters will be fagged by your department. If they are not then you can speak to the department’s legal careers adviser or failing that to the university careers department. \nCONCLUSION \nAll of the areas considered in detail in this chapter are of comparable importance because they all work together to make you a successful and competent learner. Do not be worried by them; just be aware of them and perhaps use the framework of PDP to indicate where you think you are in each skill, and plan what you need to do to develop. \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  The student who takes control of their studies, considers their goals and how to achieve them and develops good habits of independent study will be able to realise their full potential. \n  It is essential to understand the cycles of academic life through the year, your own personal teaching and assessment timetable so that you can effectively plan. \n  Lectures, seminars/tutorials and one to one sessions with tutors are important to the development of your understanding. \n\n--- Page 154 ---\n    GENERAL STUDY SKILLS 123 \n  Studying involves the simultaneous use of a range of skills, self-management, devel -\nopment planning, reading/writing skills, IT skills, interpersonal skills and communica -\ntion skills. Each has an important place in achieving a good degree. \n  Awareness of learning and teaching styles, and recognising which you prefer, and \nthe purposes of each develops fexibility and allows you to be an effective learner. \n  Using personal development planning (PDP) will assist you in goal setting, self-awareness and in having a good resource to use for CVs for law school, training contracts, grants/scholarship applications and employment. \n\n--- Page 156 ---\n6 \n  \n FINDING MATERIAL \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Understand the structure and layout of the standard university library and the con -\ntext of the law library within it. \n  Understand the difference between primary and secondary sources of legal \ninformation. \n  Develop a competent approach to locating, accessing and searching electronic resources. \n  Develop strategies to ascertain the authority and validity of retrieved materials. \n  Locate domestic and European legislation and cases. \n  Develop search strategies for journal articles and books. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-8  \n\n--- Page 157 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 126 FINDING MATERIAL  \nINTRODUCTION \nDuring your studies, research will be one of the key aspects to success. Finding the right books, articles, laws, cases and many other sources will usually be the frst step for writ -\ning an essay, preparing a presentation or putting together the arguments you will need to win a moot court scenario. Later in life, this will continue – whether you become a solicitor or barrister and need to advise a client, whether you become a research student and need to fnd obscure sources in the British Library or whether you leave law altogether – fnd -\ning relevant information is always going to be central to every decision making process. \nAs a student, it is absolutely essential that you are familiar with the library provisions \nof your university and with the other resources available to you. This chapter will therefore frst of all discuss how you can make the most of the library available to you. \nUsing the library \nGetting started \nWalking into the university library can be a daunting experience. New students of all ages often report a feeling of inadequacy when frst confronted with the scenes of a typical library lobby. There are lots of people (all of whom seem to know what they are doing); there are issue desks, banks of computers, banks of photocopiers, unfamiliar signage, student study support staff and private study rooms. There may be coffee bars, and some may have imposing atriums built to a scale that dwarfs individual users; there are cloakrooms and rules about bags. Entrance to the library is often through security checks and the scanning of your library card. Some libraries have not taken on the dimensions of huge factory buildings or implemented security measures, but even these can feel extremely alien to the new student. \nLibrarians and lecturers do realise, however, that students need to be orientated to the \nlibrary and the structure of its resources so that they can use it competently. You will fnd that all libraries arrange a general induction to the layout and range of resources for new students. Additionally the law department, usually in liaison with library staff, will arrange for a series of specialist training sessions to introduce new law students to the print and electronic collections. Often there are opportunities for updates and more advanced train -\ning throughout the frst year and one to one assistance may be offered to students who lack confdence. It is important to be aware of what support and training is on offer in your library so that you can make the best use of it. Many libraries and departments also provide links to in-house and external online tutorials concerned with using the library. You should check for these in your university’s departmental, library, study support and induction web pages as well as on your department’s preferred virtual learning environment (VLE). \nNowadays, the information you can fnd in the big halls of the physical library only makes \nup a small part of the knowledge that is available to you. A wide range of information is \n\n--- Page 158 ---\n   \n \n  FINDING MATERIAL 127 \n2. \nThe university e-library \ncollec\ron: subscrip\ron \ncollec\rons and provided links \nto non-subscrip\ron sites that \naredeemed academically \nsound by the libraryand/or \nlecturer checked. Access is \nthrough user ID & password \n3. \nOpen access internet sites \n(public domain) outside the \nuniversity library. They are \nmostly non-subscrip\ron, \nbut there are a large \nnumber of subscrip\ron \nsites 1. \nThe \nuniversity \nprint library \nFigure 6.1 How the volume of different types of legal resources compare \navailable online (often only there): articles in electronic journals, e-books, cases, statutes, \nnewspaper archives and many, many other sources. Unfortunately, the world of online publishing is a big mess with different payment structures and subscription modes. It is therefore essential to learn what is and what is not available to your university and how to use the many different collections. \nIn addition to this, there is an enormous amount of information available on the internet \nin the public domain. This is fantastic because knowledge ought to be open and free, but it requires you to be extra careful when using sources – a lot of information on the internet is unreliable, biased or in some cases outright wrong. \n\n--- Page 159 ---\n 128 FINDING MATERIAL  \nThe library catalogue \nThe main library catalogue \nThis is the online catalogue of your library’s print and e-library resources which you can \nsearch by author name, title of book, or the subject area you are interested in. You can also search this catalogue from any PC, laptop or mobile phone (via the browser or in some cases with a dedicated app). In most cases, the library catalogue not only points you to physical books available on the shelf but will also give you access to online resources. \nEach print resource is allocated a ‘classifcation number’ or a ‘class mark’ and these \nnumbers or marks are grouped in subject clusters and sub-groups of subjects. Libraries tend to have signs and leafets that map the area of the law print collection, indicating which part of the building you need to go to for particular subjects. Once you have a clas -\nsifcation number or class mark, and a diagram of the library showing the location of the law resources, you will be able to go to the correct area and locate your specifc resource. \nThe classifcation number is located by searching the main online library catalogue. \nMany libraries, but not all, have banks of computers around the library and in the recep -\ntion area, which you can use to access the catalogue. \nYou will also fnd access to the cataloguing system of the e-library. Often you can \nlocate these in a number of ways by scrolling down a menu of the various resources and databases, or using a quick search to locate a particular database, or journal, or gate -\nway in alphabetic order. For example, if you are in the databases areas and click on ‘fnd databases’ you will get an alpha bar. If you wanted to locate Westlaw, clicking on ‘W’ will bring up all the databases starting with W and you can choose Westlaw. All university e-library and print collections are not exact replicas of each other. There will be deviations from the standard. Do make use of library guides which are usually free in the library or available online. \nPrinted material \nPrinted material comes in all forms and sizes, and it is useful to have a general idea about the different areas in your library. Some university libraries will have a separate section for books on ‘short loan’ – often textbooks and other core reading materials that can only be borrowed for a few days or that sometimes can only be used in the library. \nThe different types of printed material that you can fnd in a law library can usually be \nclassifed as follows: \n  Reference texts, digests, encyclopaedias, indexes, dictionaries. \n  Thin resources (pamphlets). \n  Parliamentary papers. \n  Journals (academic and professional). \n  Law reports. \n\n--- Page 160 ---\n   \n FINDING MATERIAL 129 \n  Legislation. \n  Books about the law (textbooks, scholarly or research works). \nThe nature of each of the above print resources will be briefy described and examples of \nleading publications in the areas of reference and primary law will be given. \nReference \nThere are always some books that tend to be abnormally large. These are usually refer -\nence books and it is standard practice for them to be placed together in a reference section of the main library, as it is recognised they only tend to be dipped into for lim -\nited and highly specifc information. You need to fnd out where they are, whether they are in the law area, in the general reference section or divided between the two areas. Examples of reference books include dictionaries, encyclopaedias, digests, indexes and bibliographies. \nThe sets of reference texts that are the most authoritative source of law are Halsbury’s , \nwhich include the following publications, and are also available online: \n  Halsbury’s Laws of England and Wales : frst published in 1907 to give a full statement \nof all of the laws of England and Wales, case law, legislation and now, more recently, \nEuropean law. It uses an alphabetic system to track law composed of several com -\nplementary cross-referenced publications. It has main volumes (organised by sub -\nject and re-published around every 20 years), a table of contents and a consolidated index published yearly, which will either reference the main volumes or the cumula -\ntive supplement. The cumulative supplement is published yearly to update the main volumes. Additionally, monthly digests give updates to allow a subject search for the appropriate volume. As it is concerned with individual laws classifed by subject one statute could be divided up among several volumes as often different law concerning different subjects can be contained in the one statute. \n  Halsbury’s Statutes of England and Wales : frst published in 1929 it is considered to \nbe the most authoritative source for primary and secondary legislation in England and Wales. It also refers to cases affecting or prompting legislation. The schema used is the same as for the laws, main volumes, tables of contents, indexes, cumula -\ntive supplements and monthly digests. Volumes are published when it is considered necessary. \nThin resources (pamphlets) \nThere are also some print resources that are very thin (pamphlets) and these will tend to be stored together generally in the main library, with law-related ones placed in the law library if it is in a separate area. \n\n--- Page 161 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 130 FINDING MATERIAL  \nParliamentary papers \nThere is a vast array of materials generated by Parliament, including verbatim reports of \nproceedings of the two Houses of Parliament, details of committee meetings, reports and material produced by government departments (reports, statistics, recommendations and policy reviews). Not all libraries will keep a print collection of parliamentary papers.\n1 They \nare useful for research purposes as secondary texts that shed light on the reasons for leg -\nislation, and for changes to bills as they go through the parliamentary law making process. \nJournals \nJournals are collections of articles about the law published throughout the year. Academic journals (also called periodicals) are written by academics and are an important resource for the development of your understanding of law and are vital for competent perfor -\nmance in seminars and assessed work. \nThere are also a range of professional journals that are written by practising lawyers \nand intended for the profession. These can be of use as long as you remember they are not academic but professional. \nJournals are published two, three or four times a year, with some professional journals \nbeing published more frequently. Because of their publication throughout the year jour -\nnals contain the most up to date information and analysis. \nThe law journals may be grouped together in the law library; however, some libraries \ndo like to keep all their periodicals together in one place regardless of discipline and here science rubs shoulders with art. It is important to be aware that many disciplines in their own specialist journals contain professional and academic articles about the law and you are therefore likely to fnd relevant articles about law in other disciplines such as psychol -\nogy, sociology, anthropology, medicine, politics or history. \nIt is increasingly common for journals to be read online, with all the advantages that \nbrings (easy access, full-text search, etc.). Many newer journals, particularly open access journals, do not even publish printed editions any more. \nLaw reports \nThese are the primary texts of law reports of important cases decided by senior judges in the courts. They are published in several series by private publishers, but the most respected collection is published by a charity, the Incorporated Council of Law Reporters. The courts have established a hierarchy of law reports by publisher and the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting (ICLR) are at the top. Law reports are usually stored in the law library area and are classifed within a particular law report series by year date, although there can be other ways of referencing such as by volume number. \nLegislation \nLegislation enacted by Parliament constitutes a primary text of law. It is divided into collections of primary and secondary legislation by a range of publishers and as noted \n1 T he most extensive collection is housed in the London School of Economics and Political Science Library. \n\n--- Page 162 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n FINDING MATERIAL 131 \nabove, the most authoritative is Halsbury’s Statutes  which is mainly a reference text. We \nwill consider reading and understanding legislation in detail in Chapter 7 . \nBooks \nThese secondary texts tend to be organised by topics and sub-topics, for example, crimi -\nnal law or the law of contract. It is worth remembering that the date of publication of a \nbook is likely to be 6–24 months after the completion of the manuscript of the book, due to the time needed for the publication process. This means that the law described in books may be out of date. You must always check the publication date of the book, and you should double-check the status of the law to be careful. Also, as with journals, it is important to be aware that many other disciplines interact with the law and you are therefore likely to fnd relevant books in other subject areas. \nElectronic material \nMore and more material is being hosted online, and you will fnd that even in the library building most research you do will be through electronic sources. The competent location and search of the range of electronic materials is therefore an essential skill for the law student. You need to learn how to navigate vast reservoirs of electronic resources in the e-library, which will include subscription sites used by the university as well as links to free sites considered to be useful.\n2 \nInitially you may fnd the array of internet sources overwhelming. But in fact they can \nbe reduced to a few overarching categories within which you can research. These will be set out below. Electronic resources mirror in many ways the materials contained in print collections. The best electronic materials are developed by commercial organisations, with annual subscription fees. However, there is a wide range of additional databases and internet gateways that open a huge array of electronic resources. \nAn internet gateway, which can be referred to as a portal, is a single website that \ncollects together a range of internet links on related topics. Search engines are power -\nful tools that have indexed a large number of web pages, and allow you to retrieve data through simple keyword searches. Some gateways and databases are free, whilst others are commercial and require username and password information. Many will be acces -\nsible through the electronic library of your institution, which will invest a surprisingly large amount of money into online subscriptions. \nAccessing the e-library collection \nWhen you sign in to the main library catalogue, click on the icon for the e-library and you will be taken into the sources. Your library will often group access by subject. You can therefore click on ‘law’ and be sent to another listing of sources. Some of these will be subscription sites and some free sites. There will be different access con -\nventions for each of the electronic materials. The majority require an internationally \n2 A s already noted, the invention of printing was revolutionary in the spread of knowledge; a revolutionary \ninnovation of similar dimensions has occurred through the electronic communication of knowledge. \n\n--- Page 163 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  132 FINDING MATERIAL  \nrecognised login and password, referred to as an Athens password. Today, most uni -\nversity library students’ login and password details are also automatically accred -\nited as Athens logins and passwords. At induction you will be told your own library’s \nconventions. \nWhen you have your library access sorted out, take time to explore the e-library at \nyour leisure. It will not be time wasted as you need to acquire the skills to access a range of databases quickly and easily in order to locate materials for seminar and assessment purposes. You would not just walk into a large university library and wander around until you accidentally found the law section and then luckily stumble across a relevant law book. You would locate the catalogue and engage in a methodical search. Many students approaching a database, however, do the equivalent of just aimlessly wandering around. If they do not haphazardly locate any sources from inadequate searches they erroneously conclude no such sources exist. Map the terrain of the electronic sources as well as you would the library print collection. Your lecturers will be only too pleased to guide you generally, as will library staff. \nTypes of electronic material and their standard locations \nThe same types of material available in the print collection are available through elec -\ntronic sources in the e-library, but, with the exception of books, there are also many more materials available in electronic form. Figure 6 .2 shows the type of resources generally \navailable. \nThese resources are located in a range of different places as illustrated in \nFigure 6 .3. The government open site UK Statutes Database contains only legislation. \nSubscription databases such as Westlaw and LexisNexis can each contain a large range of resources such as law reports, legislation, journals and more. These will be discussed below. \nThe resources on the internet include nearly all of those that we have listed above for \nprint collections, but the following additional resources are available: \n  Reference (most notably Halsbury online via Butterworths LexisNexis). \n  UK parliamentary papers from www.parliament.uk , as well as individual government \ndepartments. \n  Journals (academic and professional). \n  Law reports. \n  Legislation. \n  Books about the law (textbooks, scholarly or research works). \n  Blogs by noted academics and practitioners. \n  Websites of pressure groups (e.g. Amnesty International). \n  Websites containing articles and lectures by noted academics. \n  Media sites containing news reports and much more. \n\n--- Page 164 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  FINDING MATERIAL 133 \nSelec˙on of \ntypes of \nresource s \non the \ninternet Journal \nar\u0017cles \nGovernment \ndepartment s \nSpeeches, \nlectures, \ninterviews \nEuropa \nOfficial EU \nsite \nLaw reports \nTexts of Law Legisla\u0017on \nTexts of Law Parliamentary \npapers Blogs by \nacademics, \npressure \ngroups \nFigure 6.2 A selection of legal resources available on the internet \nYour librarian \nOne of the most painfully underused resources is your librarian. Many universities have dedicated law librarians, others will have librarians responsible for certain subjects. In any case librarians are a treasure trove of information! The old stereotype of the grumpy loner reading dusty old books and telling you to be quiet could not be further from the truth (although you will soon appreciate the librarian telling others to be quiet when you are revis -\ning for the exam and fellow students seem to treat the reading room as a social space): librarians are experts in locating information and in exploring new ways of learning, and they are often among the most helpful people you can encounter as a student. \nOften, the librarian gets introduced to you during the university induction process or \nin your frst weeks, whilst you are still overwhelmed with a food of information and ques -\ntions: what is my timetable? What is plagiarism? Which modules do I need to study? Will I fnd friends? Where can I get lunch? It is still worth listening to the librarian and mak -\ning sure you know where you can fnd more information. Your librarian will probably be \n\n--- Page 165 ---\n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  134 FINDING MATERIAL  \nA selecˇon of \nthe range of \nsites for \naccessing legal \ninformaˇon Open access \ngeneral search \nengines (Yahoo, \nDogpile, etc.) that \nretrieve from a \nrange of sites \nLaw databases \n(e.g. HeinOnline, \nLexisNexis, \nWestlaw) \nAcademic search \nengines \nGovernment \ndepartment s Europa \nOÿcial EU site \nfor trea°es, \nsecondary law \nand cases Organisa°onal \nwebsites \nFigure 6.3 Types of resources in standard university library collections \nresponsible for a good part of the library’s website, and it is quite likely that they will have \ngiven you lots of useful information, video tutorials, FAQs and other resources. Make sure you take some time to go through these before starting your frst essay. As mentioned before, librarians are very helpful people and they know the problems that students face when it comes to research. \nIf you are struggling with a complex problem and you cannot fnd the answer on the \nlibrary website, most librarians are very happy to talk to you directly. Make sure to check the resources already available before the meeting, and come prepared with clear ques -\ntions – that way, you can make the most of the librarian’s and of your own time. \nHow to fnd legislation \nHow to locate domestic legislation \nThere are a number of different types of primary legislation, as discussed in detail in Chapter 1 . However, this chapter will only refer to the location of the main form of primary \n\n--- Page 166 ---\n   \n FINDING MATERIAL 135 \nlegislation, Public General Acts; and to the main form of secondary legislation, statutory \ninstruments. We will consider how to fnd print and online primary legislation frst and then print and online secondary legislation. Once you have understood the methodology you will be able to transfer that knowledge if you wish to fnd other primary or secondary legislation. \nThere are many print and online resources that enable you to fnd out if there is a \nPublic General Act (a statute) covering a particular subject or to locate a statute by name, or to locate a statutory instrument. \nIt is important, however, that you know how to fnd the up to date version of any stat -\nute. Often the resources will only have the full text of the statute as originally published. Many sources only give summaries of the legislation. This can be useful but must never be confused with the up to date full-text version of the legislation. So you need to become familiar with what each print and online version can offer. \nBefore we consider the available print and online resources it is important to look at \nthe terminology used when referring to primary and secondary legislation, as it can be confusing. We will then consider issues of the citation of legislation which is key to under -\nstanding how it is catalogued and stored. \nTerminology \nSimilar words and phrases meaning legislation tend to be used interchangeably in text -\nbooks, lectures, seminars and the media. Many of these are synonyms (words meaning the same thing). Additionally, certain phrases about legislation are also used that may be unfamiliar, for example ‘date in force’. Therefore it is a good idea to start with some basic defnitions of terms you will come across. \nPrimary legislation \nThe following words are used interchangeably and all mean the same thing – primary legislation: \n  Legislation. \n  Act of Parliament. \n  Act. \n  Legislative Act. \n  Statute (which means a decree). \nTypes of primary legislation \n  A Public General Act. \n  A private Act. \n  A private member’s Act. \n  A hybrid Act. \n  Orders in Council. \n\n--- Page 167 ---\n 136 FINDING MATERIAL  \nSecondary legislation \nThe following words have the same meaning as secondary legislation: \n  Delegated legislation. \n  Subordinate legislation. \nTypes of secondary legislation \n  Bylaws. \n  Orders by Council (the Privy Council). \n  Statutory instruments. \n  Court Rules Committees. \nYear of enactment \nThis is the date that the Act received Royal Assent and was placed in the statute book. \nDate in force \nThe date in force is the date that either the entire primary or secondary legislation comes \ninto force as law, or parts or a part of it comes into force. A major issue when engaged in the task of considering the meaning and application of legislation is whether specifc legal rules contained in the legislation are currently in force as law. When you are engaged in research it is essential to know if the law you have retrieved is the most up to date ver -\nsion. Amendments may have been made, or the entire statute repealed or repealed and its provisions partly placed in other legislation. Changes can occur by: \n  Parliamentary authority, through primary legislation amending it (adding to or sub -\ntracting from it) or by repeal (abolishing it). \n  Others exercising their rights to make changes by secondary legislation to a primary \nAct. \n  The Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal determining the meaning of words and phrases in the legislation. Although English courts have no power to amend or abol -\nish legislation, their power to interpret legislation can have a major impact on its application. \nHow to understand citations for domestic legislation \nIt is essential that you understand the way in which the legislation you are locating is cited. \nCitation of primary legislation: Public General Acts \nEvery statute has a long title and usually a short title. The short title if there is one is stated in one of the sections within the statute itself. For example, the Human Rights Act 1998, \n\n--- Page 168 ---\n   FINDING MATERIAL 137 \ns 22(1) states ‘This Act may be cited as the Human Rights Act’. It is the short title that is \nused for citation purposes. Since 1963 the statute is cited with the year of enactment of the legislation. Please make sure you understand that the year of enactment, however, is not the same as the date in force. \nEvery statute also has its own number in the year identifying it chronologically. This is \nits ‘chapter’ number in the ‘statute’ book for the relevant year. The Human Rights Act was the 42nd Act of 1998 and its chapter number is therefore 42. The number is preceded by a lower case ‘c’ to indicate chapter. \nThe order of the full citation for an Act is (e.g. Human Rights Act 1998 c42): \n  Short title: The Human Rights Act. \n  Year: 1998. \n  Chapter: c. \n  Chapter number: 42. \ne.g. Human Rights Act 1998 c42 \nPrior to 1963 statutes were not cited by the chronological year, but by their number in \nthe years of reign of the monarch at the time of the Act (called the regnal year). The chap -\nter number was still used with regnal years. A regnal year starts from the date of the mon -\narch’s accession to the throne. But there is a little complication as parliamentary years run from autumn to summer, so it may be possible for there to have been two Parliaments in one regnal year depending on when in the year the monarch succeeded. Then both years need to be referred to. The order of the full statutory citation for regnal years was: \n  Short title. \n  Regnal year(s). \n  Monarch abbreviated. \n  Chapter number. \nCitation of secondary legislation: statutory instruments \nStatutory instruments are the largest grouping of secondary legislation. They are cited \nby their name, followed by the date and then the abbreviation SI, the year they were made, and the date is repeated followed by a slash and the noting of the serial number, for example: \nThe Export Control (Russia, Crimea and Sevastopol Sanctions) (Amendment) Order 2014, SI 2014/2932 \nLike chapter numbers, the serial number is consecutive, indicating its order in the SIs for the relevant year. The citation given to the SI by Parliament is used in print copies and online versions of the legislation. \n\n--- Page 169 ---\n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n               \n                                         \n  138 FINDING MATERIAL  \nHow to locate statutes in print form in the university library \nThere are a number of hard copy reference texts that allow you to locate statutes by their \nname or by topic. Sometimes you will want to fnd out if there has been any legislation on a certain topic, rather than looking for a specifc statute and we will show you how to do this. Usually any reference text you access to locate legislation will have a linked series of publications that cross-reference each other. Usually you will be able to search through subjects and sub-topics to locate lists of statutes by name, or you can search by name. Each entry will direct you to the location of the full text. \nSince you are likely to use online resources rather than print copies, not all ways of \nresearch are listed here. \nChronological table of statutes \nThese tables are printed by The Stationery Offce (TSO). The Stationery Offce was cre -\nated when Her Majesty’s Stationery Offce (HMSO) was privatised in 1996. The TSO prints most UK public documentation, including Hansard,\n3 and have partnered with the \nNational Archives to produce the offcial online database for UK legislation, www.legisla -\ntion.gov.uk . \nThe chronological table details all statutes since 1235 by year and chapter number. \nThere is also a chronological table of statutory instruments (which is also online). The tables are a fascinating and essential place for historical research. \nA drawback with the table is that it is always several years out of date. The table indi -\ncates when statutes have been changed in any way. It uses standard abbreviations to indicate whether a statute has been applied (appl) amended (am), or repealed (rep). Any statute in the list that is in italics is either not in force or only partially in force. \nHalsbury’s Statutes \nWhilst Halsbury’s  gives the full text of statutes with amendments and repeals, it is also a \nsummary reference text detailing relevant debates in Hansard, explanatory notes with the bill, and cases applying the legislation and interpreting it. \nThe hard copy version is divided into law reports and statutes. It has a cumulative \ndigest of legal rules and an index. \nHalsbury’s Statutes of England  identifes legislation that has been corrected and/or \nrepealed. Halsbury’s Statutory Instruments  gives a classifcation of statutes ‘in force’, as \nwell as giving the text of a selection of rules, orders and regulations. \nHalsbury’s Statutes  is divided into a series of volumes and updates as follows: \nThe main volumes: these contain the full text of statutes organised by topic and anno -\ntated with changes incorporated into the text. There is a table of contents listing all Acts and also a subject index. \n3 H ansard among other things publishes edited records of debates in Parliament (edited because repeti -\ntions and mistakes are taken out of the record). It is published daily: www.parliament.uk/business/pub \nlications/hansard/commons/ or www.parliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/lords and \ndebates from 1803 can be accessed online at Historic Hansard ( http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/). \n\n--- Page 170 ---\n   FINDING MATERIAL 139 \nCurrent Statutes service: six loose-leaf volumes are published each year, updating the \nmain volumes with Acts passed since their publication. \nThe cumulative supplement: this summarises the effect of new legislation on the legisla -\ntion in the main volumes, so it updates previous volumes with references to repeals \nand amendments of case references. Each Act is updated until the end of the year previous to the date of publication of the supplement. \nThe noter-up service: this gives information concerning changes to the legislation in the \nmain volumes and the Current Statutes service since the publication of the cumula -\ntive supplement. \nConsolidated index: this is the annual index of the main volume and the Current Statutes \nservice, which also contains an alphabetical list of statutes (the table of statutes). A search by name of Act will retrieve a number in bold (the volume number) followed by the page number. The abbreviation ‘(S)’ indicates that the Act is in the Current Statutes service. It is useful as it has alphabetical, chronological and subject indexes to the legislation. \nDestination tables \nUse this to track provisions of consolidating legislation back to earlier provisions. \nIf you know the name of the Act, search for it in the consolidated index in the alpha -\nbetical list of statutes. You will fnd the statute followed by a number in bold and then a second number. The bold number is the volume number and the second number is the page reference in the volume. One diffculty with Halsbury’s  is that the main volumes are \narranged by subject matter. As statutes tend to deal with a range of subjects, one statute may appear in many different sections of Halsbury’s . You will not fnd the full text of the \nstatute. When you have all of the information you wish you will need to check that it is still ‘in force’ or if it is a very new statute if all of it or only part of it is ‘in force’. This facility only goes back to 1961 so you would need to consult another source for pre-1961 statutes. The noter-up will update ‘in force’ changes. \nHow to use Halsbury’s Statutes \nThe way in which Halsbury’s Statutes  is organised means that you need to consult not \nonly the main volumes but the cumulative supplement and the ‘noter-up’ to check the most up to date position of the legislation you are concerned with. A good method to use to locate a specifc Act is as follows: \n  To fnd out which volume has the full text of the Act you need to look at the Table of \nStatutes and Consolidated Index, which gives you the volume number of the statute in bold, as well as the page number, or if it predates the main volumes you are given the reference (S) after the volume number so that you know to consult the Current Statutes Service. \n\n--- Page 171 ---\n \n \n \n  \n    \n  \n   \n  140 FINDING MATERIAL  \n  When you locate the main volume you will fnd the full text of the statute with the text of \namendments in square brackets. You will be alerted to the removal of text by three dots … (ellipses). Footnotes give you more details about interpretation, relevant cases, etc. \n  To ensure you have up to date legislation check the ‘cumulative supplement’ for any updating. You will note that it is subdivided into 50 so you can access the exact volume number that you want and you can then scan it for the page number. If you cannot fnd any entry, this means that you can be certain that up until the date of the supplement there have not been any changes. \n  Then to be absolutely sure check the noter-up, which contains information after the publication for the cumulative supplement, which is divided in the same way as the supplement. \nHow to locate statutes online \nThe easiest way to access legislation online is through your university’s e-library search facility. As already noted many university libraries are moving away from print to e-copy in relation to primary legal material. There is a vast array of online access both subscription-based and in the public domain (free). Subscription databases tend to offer useful search -\nable extras in addition to the full text of the legislation. For example, you can search for cases dealing with your legislation, as well as locate journal articles or e-books discuss -\ning the legislation. \nThe main subscription sites \n  Westlaw: published by Sweet and Maxwell www.westlaw.com containing UK, Irish, EU legislation, a large range of academic and professional journals. \n  LexisNexis: published by Butterworths  www.lexisnexis.co.uk  covers UK legislation \nand also provides Halsbury’s Statutes  online. \n  Justis: www.justis.com containing a growing collection of UK, Irish and EU case \nreports. UK case records go back to the earliest year books in 1163 and it refers to legislation from 1235. \nPublic domain sites \nBy far the largest set of free resources can be found in the public domain, but these do vary in reliability from site to site. The following sites are more reliable and include legis -\nlation made available by government and Parliament. They will all have differing cut-off dates for the start of the collections and will vary in the information on offer. \n  Offcial government site for all UK legislation: www.legislation.gov.uk . \n  British and Irish Legal Information Institute (BAILII): http://www.bailii.org contains \nBritish and Irish legislation. It takes its statutory data from the Offce of Public Sector Information (OPSI) and is a free searchable site. \n\n--- Page 172 ---\n   \n   \n  \n      \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n  FINDING MATERIAL 141 \n  Offce of Public Sector Information: www.opsi.gov.uk . This site contains the full text \nof Public General Acts, since 1988, and local Acts, since 1991, and reproduces the \nstatute in the form in which it was originally enacted. It contains statutory instruments going back to 1987. This site does its utmost to get a copy of a statute online within a day of its publication. \n  Parliament: www.parliament.uk . Here you can locate current legislation. \nEach site will have its own particular navigation. Which sites you access and what you understand about the site will determine whether you retrieve the most up to date legislation. \nLocating Legislation on legislation.gov.uk \nProbably the most useful site when it comes to legislation is the offcial one: legislation .gov.uk. It is very easy to use and gives you a very clear overview of everything that is relevant when looking at law – primary or secondary. \nIf you know the name of the legislation you are looking for, you can type it into the \nsearch box at the top of the homepage, and you will be presented with the search results. You can also fnd it by typing in parts of the title (e.g. the search results for ‘human rights’ will include the Human Rights Act 1998). The ‘type’ drop-down menu on the right gives you the opportunity to be more specifc whether you are looking for a UK Public General Act or other forms of primary and secondary legislation. There is also an ‘Advanced search’ option, which allows you to search, for example, for all laws that contain the word ‘race’ and were passed between 1995 and 2005. \nOnce you have found a piece of legislation, the website will show you the table of con -\ntents of the latest updated version. When looking at the different sections, you can see the different versions presented in a timeline. Try, for example, to fnd the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2006 and have a browse through the different sections – you will see that some of these have been changed twice or more, some have been untouched, some have been added later and so on. You can click on the points in the timeline to see what this section of the Act looked like in 2014 or in 2006. This can be very useful information when you are critically analysing a law or researching older cases. \nHow to locate draft primary and secondary legislation \nThere will be times in your studies when it is useful to be able to locate the bills currently going through Parliament. A bill is the draft form of an Act and it can change consider -\nably as it goes through the Houses of Parliament. Or you may wish to locate former versions of bills (draft bills). The offcial online site www.legislation.gov.uk does not keep \nrecords of draft primary legislation, although it does have the full-text draft secondary legislation. \nExtensive information on draft primary legislation can be located on the UK parliamen -\ntary website, www.parliament.uk . Here you can also look at draft bills, which are copies \n\n--- Page 173 ---\n \n   \n   \n \n   142 FINDING MATERIAL  \nof bills before  they have been formally introduced in Parliament and have begun their way \nthrough the procedures for enactment. You can also fnd out where any bill is in its pas -\nsage through Parliament. \nThe best place to fnd these is Parliament’s own website. Having accessed the site, \nnavigate to primary legislation and then to bills. Icons denote whether a particular bill has \nits introduction pending, and whether it is currently in the House of Commons or House of Lords. If you click on any bill in your retrieved list you will be told where it is in its passage through the house and what the next stage is. You will be shown a general diagram of the full procedures of a bill with the current stage of the bill you are considering highlighted in black. When shown online, the procedures in the House of Commons box are green and those in the House of Lords are in red, with the amendments stage showing as an ‘A’ in a half green and half red circle. \nEuropean treaties and secondary legislation \nEU primary law is located in EU treaties and protocols; secondary law is derived from the law making of the EU’s institutions, the main forms being regulations, directives and opinions. \nSince 1 July 2013 print formats of EU law in all but a few cases do not constitute an \nauthentic, offcial copy of the law; the only offcial copy is the online version. If you are studying EU law, it makes sense to get yourself a statute book (such as Blackstone’s ). The \nstatutes that you will need are usually changing at a much slower pace than the domestic ones \nEUR-Lex is the major resource for EU law. The EU site, EUR-Lex: www.eur-lex.europa , \ncontains information and the full text of all EU law. It is also the host for the offcial jour -\nnal of the EU. Similar to legislation.gov.uk, EUR-Lex allows you to search for treaties as well as secondary legislation and preparatory Acts. If you know what you are looking for you can use the quick search box at the bottom of the front page; otherwise, the ‘Advanced search’ is very useful. Additionally you can use the tab ‘national’ to retrieve all the national law of all member states relating to the implementation of treaties and secondary legislation. \nLocating the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and its protocols \nWhen you are researching the ECHR (and any other treaty) you must ensure that you have up to date knowledge of treaties/protocols, their signature and whether all or only some signatory states ratifed them. It is not enough just to check derogations and reservations from the original treaties, and later treaties, whether new or accession. \nWith regard to the Council of Europe (CoE) you can locate this treaty and its subse -\nquent protocols on the Council of Europe Treaty Offce website: www.conventions.coe .int. \n\n--- Page 174 ---\n   \n \n \n FINDING MATERIAL 143 \nHow to fnd cases \nLocating cases in the English legal system \nRecords of law cases are produced in various ways, and not all are available outside the \narchives of the courts. Since 2000 many courts have made their verbatim transcript of the judgment in cases freely available online via the relevant court’s website. Additionally charitable and commercial companies publish general and specialist series of reports of important cases. The reports vary in the information given. Some will give a summary of the case and/or include the arguments of the barristers for the parties as well as the full text of the judgments. They usually list cases referred to in the judgments, noting whether a case has been distinguished or applied. Keywords or catchwords may also be provided, noting the main issues the case is concerned with. These reports are in print series and/or online and often found in both formats. \nYour university library will provide you with access to a wide range of these reports \nboth in print formats and online through the e-library. \nTerminology \nThe words or phrases ‘law cases’, ‘case law’, ‘cases’, ‘legal authority’, ‘authority’, ‘law reports’, ‘court transcripts’ or just ‘transcript’ are often used interchangeably in textbooks, lectures, seminars and in the media. However, they each have a different and precise mean -\ning. Therefore it is a good idea to start with some basic defnitions so that you are at least aware of the technically correct meaning of key words and phrases. Table 6 .1 sets these out. \nThe development of law reporting in the English legal system \nThe English legal system is a common law legal system with a relatively strict adherence to the doctrine of precedent, which states that judges in court must follow the decisions of the senior judiciary in the higher courts when determining cases before them.\n4 As we \nonly know what judges say because of the written reports of proceedings it is essential to have a system of accurate reporting of legal cases. If you cannot trust the reporting upon which the precedent is based, then you cannot trust the law. \nSurprisingly, there are no offcial series of law reports in England to equate with the \nQueen’s Printer’s copy of an Act of Parliament. The Stationery Offce is responsible for publishing revenue, immigration and social security law cases. However, traditionally, law reports remain in the hands of private publishers. It is a long-established but conventional rule that a law report, if it is to be accepted by the relevant court as a legal authority, must have been prepared by, and published under, the name of a fully qualifed barrister. \nBecause the publishers of law reports are private organisations, each publisher will \ntend to structure their reports differently, perhaps adding footnotes or summaries, per -\nhaps including or excluding the arguments put by counsel. However, what remains con -\nstant across all reports is that words attributed to the judge in his or her judgment have to \n4 S ee Chapter 2 for more detail on the operation of the doctrine of precedent. \n\n--- Page 175 ---\n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n   \n                                       \n            \n   144 FINDING MATERIAL  \nTABLE 6.1 TECHNICAL MEANING OF KEY WORDS/PHRASES USED IN \nRELATION TO COURT CASES AND THEIR REPORTING \nTerm Explanation \nLaw case A law case refers to a court hearing of a legal dispute. This can be a trial, in \nwhich case it is the frst time that the legal dispute has been heard in court. The correct terminology is to call this a ‘frst instance’ hearing. Or a court hearing can be an appeal against the trial outcome, the award of damages in a civil case, or against the outcome of a previous appeal. \nCourt A court transcript is the verbatim written record of the judgments delivered in \ntranscripts court compiled by an employee of the court, the court stenographer, although digital technology is increasingly being used in the courts. The transcript is archived by the court. Many English courts make their transcripts freely available online, and these can be accessed through Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk. Additionally many subscription databases which publish law reports also publish the transcript alongside the law report as a pdf. \nCase law This is the term used to refer to law cases in which there has been the creation of, or amendment to, a common law rule by senior judges in their judgments in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. When a law case creates or extends a legal rule it creates a legal precedent, and becomes a legal authority.\na \nLegal A law case that, in its written form (which can be a court transcript or a \nauthority privately published report) creates a precedent that can be used in legal argument, and can bind a court in the hierarchy of courts (they must abide by the legal rule created in the law case).\nb \nLaw report A law report is a written record of a law case produced by a private law report publisher. There are no offcial English legal system law reports. Law publishers will publish a case when it is considered that it establishes a precedent, or it resolves an uncertainty in law. Some law reports are considered more reliable than others and the courts have acknowledged, through practice directions, a hierarchy of private law reports with the Law Reports  series by the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting (ICLR) at the top. \naHansard among other things publishes edited records of debates in Parliament (edited because repetitions and mistakes are taken out of the record). It is published daily: www.p arliament.uk/business/publications/hansard/commons/ or www.parliament.uk/business/pub \nlications/hansard/commons/lords and debates from 1803 can be accessed online at Historic \nHansard (http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/). \nbIn Chapter 2 . \nremain a true and accurate record of the words that were actually spoken by the judge. As \nthe editors of each series of law reports can choose which cases to publish, some cases can appear in more than one law report series. \nParties to a legal dispute being heard in court have to accept the decision of the \ncourt at the time it is given. This is the court’s determination of the decision between the \n\n--- Page 176 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n FINDING MATERIAL 145 \nparties. The detail of any precedent developing from the case is noted after the case has been reported and more widely read and discussed. Editors of law report collections, academics and judges may all publish articles and commentaries on a particular case. But it is only in the reasoning of judges in later cases in the senior courts that the prec -\nedent value of a law case can be tested, and affrmed or distinguished. \nWhilst the competent production of reliable law cases is indispensable to the opera -\ntion of the doctrine of precedent, such law reports have actually only been available in England since 1865, but the reference to the use of the doctrine of precedent has been made for hundreds of years.\n5 \nThere were law reports before 1865, but they are not considered completely reliable. \nThere are a range of fragmentary law reports covering the period 1272–1535 known as Yearbooks. The Yearbooks begin with Edmund Plowden’s Commentaries, but it was not until the eighteenth century that three law reporters, Burrow, Cowper and Douglas, began to work towards standardising how the reports appeared. \nTowards the end of the eighteenth century, judges got involved in the appointment of \nreporters to the courts and either reviewed reports of their judgments or made written ver -\nsions of their judgments available to the reporters. The Yearbooks were handwritten for hun -\ndreds of years in legal French, with some being printed from the ffteenth century onwards. \nHowever, it is not always possible to discover if the report in the Yearbook is of an actual \ncase or a moot (a fctional legal argument staged as a competition between lawyers). The detail given in these reports varies. Some reports record outcome but not facts; others record facts and outcome but give no reasoning process. Quite often no judgment is recorded, only the pleadings. The quality of the report also varies considerably. These facts contribute to their unreliability as a source. Consequently they are rarely cited in court. There is a modern reprint of the Yearbooks by the Selsdon Society and by the Ames Foundation with an English translation. The Bodleian Library in Oxford has a full print collection of the Yearbooks. \nThere is also another set of law reports dating from the late ffteenth century to 1865 that \nexist in a series of reports called ‘the nominate reports’ meaning (named reports). These are reports classifed according to the name of the reporter, such as Coke’s Reports. They too suffer from unreliability relating to the information found in them. There are even concerns that some reports are written by partisan lawyers in such a way as to be slanted towards a particular reading of the reasoning of the case to ensure the same reading in later cases coming before the court. \nBy the nineteenth century, a court-authorised reporter was attached to all higher courts \nand their reports were published in collected volumes catalogued by the name of the relevant reporter. In 1865, there were 16 reporters compiling and publishing authorised reports and in that year these reports were amalgamated into the ICLR, which became a charitable organisation in 1970. As a general rule, law reports predating the ICLR’s crea -\ntion in 1865 are considered to be of doubtful accuracy and reliability as legal authorities. Whilst these reports can be referred to in legal argument in court, they rarely are. \n5 Ibid \n\n--- Page 177 ---\n \n \n  146 FINDING MATERIAL  \nToday, there are numerous, often competitive, private publishers of law reports. The \nrange of types of available law reports is shown in Figure 6 .4, which additionally includes \nsources that are pre-1865, indicating whether they are also available online. \nThere are a number of publishers of law reports, and the editors of each will apply \ndifferent criteria for determining which law cases to report. Measured against the vast \nnumbers of cases that are not reported, the percentage of cases that are reported is very small. It has been estimated that the cases in the ICLR Law Reports only cover 7 per cent of the cases in the higher courts in any given year. \nSome published law reports are annotated, particularly for the use of practitioners; \nothers are left without annotations or introductions. There are generalist law report series reporting important cases in a range of areas of law. But private law publishers have also introduced a specialist series of reports dealing with only one area of law such as employment law, criminal law and company law. \nNote on unreported cases generally \nThe vast majority of cases are unreported, but many of these are published online as court transcripts. An increasing number of cases in transcript format in the archives of the court and the Supreme Court Library contain thousands of fles of unreported cases. These record witness statements and judgments. \nCourt transcripts have been free online since 1996 with more and more courts mak -\ning this service available.

Post-2009 you can fnd deci -\nsions at www.jcpc.gov.uk . \nCase summaries and full-text cases \nMany of the online databases, as well as the digests in print form, give case summaries. Whilst there is nothing wrong with a case summary you must realise that a summary is an interpretation of the case by someone else. It is not the actual law case, and it does not contain the law, nor is it a legal authority. The author may have misinterpreted the case, accidentally or deliberately. To access the law you need to read the judgments in the full text in the law report. Only the judgment contains the law. \nThe development of digital technology has allowed the development of a vast range of \nelectronic retrieval systems for accessing the details of thousands of unreported cases. \nThis has caused its own problems and there has been a legitimate concern that courts \nwould be inundated with cases that did not really contain any new law. As a consequence of this concern the House of Lords, in the case of Roberts Petroleum Ltd v Bernard Kenny Ltd,\n6 took the step of forbidding the citation of unreported cases of the Civil Division of the \nCourt of Appeal without special leave. \nThe hierarchy of the law reports \nAlthough there are no offcial series of law reports, an accepted hierarchy of law reports has been established by the senior courts through their practice directions. The most reli -\nable reporting is considered to be found in the Law Reports  series published by the ICLR. \nThis series reports the most important cases heard in the Supreme Court (and previously the House of Lords), the Privy Council, the Court of Appeal, the High Court (Chancery, Family and Queen’s Bench divisions), the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the European Court of Justice. They are bound in differing series of law reports, the Appeal Cases (AC), and then the High Court decisions in Queen’s Bench Division, Chancery, Family and Probate. These are checked by the judges sitting in the relevant case prior to publication. \nThe ICLR Law Reports series reports all cases: \n  Where new rules or principles are introduced into the legal system. \n  Which modify existing rules of principles of the legal system. \n  Which resolve doubt in relation to a question of law. \n  Which the Council considers important in terms of instructiveness. \nThe Law Reports  series contains the argument of counsel for the parties and each report \nis checked before publication by the judges’ bench hearing the case. The courts have \n6 [1983] 2 AC 192. \n\n--- Page 179 ---\n \n  \n      \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n  148 FINDING MATERIAL  \nmade clear that these are the most authoritative reports and must be cited over and \nabove any other series of reports that may have published the same case. \nThe Law Reports  are published monthly in four sections and bound annually: \n(1) Queen’s Bench (QB), and the Court of Appeal. \n(2) Chancery (Ch) and the Court of Appeal. \n(3) Family (Fam) Divisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. \n(4) Appeal Cases heard in the UK Supreme Court and Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. \nThe reports are available in subscription form in print or online-only formats, or both, by the ICLR. \nIn 2012 the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, issued a ‘Practice Direction: Citation of \nAuthorities (2012)’\n7 which in effect sets out the hierarchy for citation of authorities in court \nas it determines the following practice when an authority is cited in court, in written or oral submissions: \n(1) When a judgment is reported in the Law Reports  series of the ICLR (AC, QB, Ch and \nFAM) that report must be cited and no other. \n(2) If the judgment is not in the law reports series at the time of the case, and it is in the ICLR Weekly Law Reports (WLR) or the All England Law Reports (All ER) then either of these reports can be cited. \n(3) If a judgment is not in the Law Reports , WLR or the All ER a report in any authoritative \nspecialist series can be used provided it ‘contain[s] a headnote and [is] made by indi -\nviduals holding a Senior Courts qualifcation (for the purposes of s 115 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990)’.\n8 The ICLR also publishes another set of law reports \nknown as the Weekly Law Reports ; these are published prior to any checking by the \njudiciary in small pamphlet format. Ultimately they are bound in volumes for the year. Those in Volumes 1 and 2 can be found checked by the judges in the Law Reports series. Those in Volume 3 have not found their way into the Law Reports . Whilst the \nLaw Reports  take 10–14 months to be published, the Weekly Law Reports , because \nthey are not checked, take fve months. \n(4) If a judgment is not reported in 1–3 above then any report it is cited in can be used. \n(5) Reference can be made to the offcial transcript of a court case if there is no report.\n9 \nA judgment can have two stages, as ‘handed down in court’, which may then be sub -\nject to later changes and the fnal version fled as the offcial transcript. The handed-down version cannot be cited in court. (You can get these from the courts or BAILII (http://www.bailii.org/ ).) But unreported cases should only be cited if they contain a \nrelevant legal principle that is not available in a reported case. \n(6) If counsel considers that the case that is the correct one to cite in the hierarchy does not for some reason give the ‘full picture’ then he or she is at liberty to explain this to \n7 P ractice Direction: Citation of Authorities (2012) 1 WLR 780 – ICLR. \n8 Ibid., 8. \n9 A judgment can have two stages, as ‘handed down in court’ which may then be subject to later changes \nand the fnal version fled as the offcial transcript.

Occasions do arise when one report is fuller \nthan another, or when there are discrepancies between reports. On such occasions, the practice outlined above need not be followed, but the court should be given a brief explanation of why this course is being taken, and alternative references should be given. \nIt is good to get into the habit of automatically adopting the rule that you will only use the most authoritative version of the report in your written work. Similarly, should you decide to engage in mooting, a competitive form of formal legal argument between two teams of students role playing counsel, you will lose vital marks if you do not cite the most authori -\ntative law report of the case you are using. \nWhat is the relationship of electronic forms to print forms of law cases? \nThe electronic collections of unreported as well as reported law cases are huge, far in excess of those printed. It was the huge array of electronic cases that led to the introduc -\ntion of neutral citations by the courts to bring an order to the reference system used in relation to unreported cases. As the use of the internet spirals and more law reports of cases are converted into electronic form this raises an issue for the legal system. What is the relationship of electronic forms of cases to print formats, particularly in relation to the hierarchy of law reporting? When should a court seriously consider cases that are unre -\nported in the print version but are reported electronically? The electronic source does not displace the hierarchy of the print series. \nChoosing your legal authorities \nWhen reading any law report you should ask whether it is the most authoritative version available. Or are there more authoritative versions? You should also consider whether there is any other case that is only recorded electronically that may be of authority. \nYou could also ask yourself if there might be any unreported case that could be more \nauthoritative than the law report you have located. This would only be a task you would undertake for research or professional purposes. As you now know the courts have strict rules about admitting as authoritative, cases where only electronic versions are available. \nJust because a case has not been reported, or if it is only reported in electronic for -\nmat, it does not mean it cannot be an important case or be used. You would need to access court transcripts yourself to determine these matters, and keep to the established rules for using them in court. \nHow to understand citations \nNeutral citations \nSince 2001 every approved judgment in the Supreme Court, Privy Council, Court of Appeal, the Administrative Court and latterly the divisions of the High Court (Chancery, \n\n--- Page 181 ---\n \n   150 FINDING MATERIAL  \nYear \nCriminal Law  S equence numbe r \nJurisdic\u0007o n of court R v Simpson [2003] EWCA Crim 149 9 \n(e.g.  EW = England & Wales) Cour t(CA = Court of Appeal) \nFigure 6.5 Constituent parts of a neutral citation \nQueen’s Bench, Commercial, Admiralty, Family, etc.) has been given a neutral citation \nby the court as shown in Figure 6 .5. It is a very simple citation. The names of the parties \nare given followed by the year of the case in square brackets (indicating this is the year that the case was heard) and the jurisdiction (e.g. UK for the United Kingdom or EW for England and Wales).\n10 This is followed by the court (e.g. SC, CA, HC), the jurisdiction of \nthe court and then whether it is civil (Civ) or criminal (Crim). Finally a sequence or serial number assigned to the case is given. \nTo assist you with learning the court abbreviations and to reinforce court structure, \nFigure 6 .6 below sets out some of the most used abbreviations in neutral citations. \nThe neutral citation is completely independent of any private law report citations. If \nyou are dealing with a case that has a neutral citation, the neutral citation must be given before any citation of a law report of that case. \nThe neutral citation must be given immediately after the names of the parties and this \nis then followed by any report of the case (given in order of hierarchy). The citation for R v Simpson  is set out to demonstrate this. \nR v Simpson  [2003] EWCA Crim 1499, [2004] QB 118, [2003] 3 All ER 531 \nUnderstanding law report citations of private publishers \nWhen a case is reported by a private publisher it will have a citation which is the abbrevi -\nated reference to the case. Any e-copy of the reported case will also give the citation of the printed report. The citation gives slightly differing information depending upon the print or exclusively online location of the case, and whether the case is reported by a private publisher or is unreported (in which case the only written record would be the court transcript). \nIf the report of the case is only online then the full web address must be given to \npinpoint the case. Additionally, if you are using this citation you must give the date you accessed the site. \n10 The Supreme Court has UK wide jurisdiction whilst the Court of Appeal and the High Court only have \njurisdiction within the English and Welsh legal systems. \n\n--- Page 182 ---\n   \n  \n \n  151 FINDING MATERIAL \nSUPREME COURT \nUKSC \nNote: Prior to 2009 HOUS E OF LORD S UKHL \nCOURT OF APPEAL \nCriminal Divisio n Civil Di vision \nEWCA Cr im EWCA Civ PRIVY \nCOUNCIL \nUKPC \nHIGH COUR T EWHC \nFamily \nEWHC (Fam ) Queen’s \nBenc h \nEWHC (QB) Chancery \nEWHC (Ch) Commercial \nCourt \nEWHC (Com m) Admiralty \nCour t \nEWHC (Adm lty) Technology and \nConstruc˜on Cour t \nEWHC (TCC) Patents Court \nEWHC (Pat ) \nFigure 6.6 Court structure showing neutral citation abbreviations used for court and jurisdiction \nWhilst there may seem at frst to be far too many citations for you to remember you \nwill fnd that understanding the broad logic of citations means that you know how to read \nnew citations. \nThe size and number of important cases cannot be predicted each year and therefore \npublications of law reports must have room to expand. They are therefore published in series. The standard format adopted by many publishers is to issue small loose-leaf pub -\nlications of selected law reports weekly, monthly, quarterly or half-yearly, which will even -\ntually be bound into annual volumes. These pamphlet-sized publications usually have the publisher, date run and prospective volume number and page numbers running along the spine. \nThey are then bound yearly into a book or books, called a volume. The year, the series \nand the volume number for the year are printed on the spine of the book, along with an abbreviated form of the publication’s name. When there is a particularly busy year there will be more than one volume for the year, and each volume will be numbered con -\nsecutively, 1, 2 and 3, and so on. Each volume will run chronologically from January to December, with Volume 1 containing cases from January onwards. \nEach publisher of private reports will have different abbreviations, but what remains \nstatic is the fact that normally a citation includes the year of the case, an abbreviation of the full name of the private report, the volume number if applicable and the page number in the print version of the report. \n\n--- Page 183 ---\n \n      \n \n   152 FINDING MATERIAL  \nTABLE 6.2 ABBREVIATIONS FOR LAW REPORTS PUBLISHED IN PRINT \nAC Appeal Cases (Law Reports series) \nAll ER All England Law Reports \nAll ER (EC) All England Reports European Cases \nBCLC Butterworths Company Law Cases \nCh Chancery (Law Reports series) \nCLR Commonwealth Law Reports \nCMLR Common Market Law Reports \nCox CC Cox’s Criminal Cases (Law Reports) \nCr App R Criminal Appeal Reports \nECC European Commercial Cases \nECHR European Commission on Human Rights Decisions and Reports 1976–1998 \nECR European Court Reports 1954 (Court of Justice of the European Community) \nECR 1 European Court of First Instances/General court report \nER English Reports \nFAM Law Reports Series Family \nHRLR Human Rights Law Reports \nICR Industrial Cases Reports \nIRLR Industrial Relations Law Reports \nKB King’s Bench (Law Reports series) \nQB Queen’s Bench (Law Reports series) \nTLR Times Law Reports \nSome publishers will separate out cases heard in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme \nCourt. Some series of reports only deal with specialist areas of law, such as company law, \nor employment law; other series are generalists dealing with all areas. \nAs you are asked to locate law cases you will become familiar with the range of reports \nand forms of citation. You will start to internalise the different abbreviations without effort. In your early days of study it may be useful to keep a modest list of abbreviations handy as a quick translation. \nThe citation provides all of the information you need to give the proper reference in \nyour written work – with the caveat that there are a few differences in referencing systems used in UK Law schools.\n11 If you do not recognise the abbreviation in your citation then it \nis quick and easy to refer to the Cardiff Index of Legal Abbreviations, which is locatable online at www.legalabbrevs.cardiff.ac.uk . \nYou will fnd over 100 law report abbreviations on the database. Table 6 .2 above lists \nthe most popular abbreviations you are likely to come across in your frst year of study. \nIt is useful at this point to give some detailed consideration of year dates (both of the \ncase and publication) and party names as used in law report citations. \n11 See the section on referencing and plagiarism in Chapter 10 . \n\n--- Page 184 ---\n   \n \n  \n  FINDING MATERIAL 153 \nR v Camplin [1978] AC 705 \nPage number for start of report \nRegina, the prosec u\u000bon is  Year of repor t \nbrought in the name of the \nQueen as the fgurehead The defendant Abbrevia\u000bon of the law report series: \nfor the st ate     Appeal Cases \nFigure 6.7 Constituent parts of a citation for a criminal case published in the ICLR Law Reports series \nYear dates and law reports \nPrior to 1890, year dates were not put on volumes of law reports – other conventions were \nused to locate the case, and the year was not part of the citation. Most usually an abbrevi -\nated version of the author’s name, often just an initial of the surname, was used to locate the case, with volume number and page numbers being indicated, for example, Heydon’s Case (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a 101. \nThe above report abbreviation ‘Co’ refers to Sir Edward Coke, an infuential fgure in \nsixteenth-century law. His reports are in seven volumes, and are a collection of writings. They concerned cases where he had been counsel, cases he had been in court for and cases he had heard of! He began them whilst still a law student. Of variable quality in the early years from 1572, they stabilised from 1579. Note the round brackets indicating you need to know the date to fnd the case in Coke’s Reports. \nToday, the dates of pre-1890 cases are placed in round brackets ( ) in the law report \ncitation. This indicates the fact that you do not need the date in order to fnd the case, though it may be helpful. You will need a name of a publication or an author, and a volume number. Law reports post-1890 place the date in square brackets [ ] to indicate that the year the case was published is necessary to locate it. You may wonder why it is neces -\nsary to mention cases pre-1890. However, in the English common law system, it is quite possible that some of the leading cases you will need to refer to were reported pre-1890. \nDate of reporting a case contrasted with date of hearing a case \nThe year date given in the citation is the year in which the case was reported. You need to be aware that it is possible that the case itself may not have been heard in that year. For example, a case may be heard in late December and not reported until January, when the year date will have changed. Also, sometimes an editor is slow to realise the importance of a case, or its importance is not realised until another case has referred to it. Then the case can only be published at the earliest opportunity, but it may already be several years after the case was heard. It is therefore important to check the date of hearing in the actual report itself so that you do not make an error concerning when the case was heard. \nCase names \nCase names are cited in different ways according to whether they are criminal, civil or judicial review cases, family law cases,\n12 probate cases or shipping cases.13 You will learn \n12 Which are usually anonymised. \n13 Usually the name of the ship is used. \n\n--- Page 185 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   154 FINDING MATERIAL  \nGeorge Mitchell v Finney Lock Seeds [1983] 2 AC 803 \nPage number of start of report\nAppellant Respondent \nYear of Case Abbrevia\bon of Law \nVolume Report series: Appeal Court \nnumber \nFigure 6.8 Constituent parts of a citation for a civil case published in the ICLR Law Reports series \nthese differences slowly, but initially you are most likely to come across criminal cases \nand civil cases in your frst year of study. Therefore only these two will be considered. \nCriminal cases \nR v Camplin [1978] AC 705 is the citation for a criminal case. You can see that the frst name is a capital letter, R. This is an abbreviation of the Latin for King (Rex) and Queen (Regina). A criminal case is brought in the name of the Crown, for the monarch is the head of state. The defendant’s name in criminal proceedings comes second as the monarch is bringing a case against the defendant for an alleged breach of the criminal law. The notation signifying the prosecution is the italicised letter v, which stands for the Latin ‘versus’, meaning ‘against’. However, if you are speaking, the ‘v’ is always said as ‘and’ not ‘versus’ (unlike in the United States, where lawyers pronounce the letter ‘v’ or say ‘versus’). Figure 6 .4 gives a breakdown of the elements making up the \nfull citation \nInitially you can go to the section of the library where the law reports are kept and \nlocate the volume you need by searching chronologically through the spines of the Appeal Cases series. Once located you turn to page 705. Or you can access it online. \nCivil cases \nThe names of both parties are given in civil trial law report citations with the complainant’s name given frst and the defendant’s second. The notation ‘v’ is used (again, pronounced ‘and’) and the citation rules are the same, as shown in Figure 6 .5, where the breakdown \nis given for George Mitchell v Finney Lock Seeds  [1983] 2 AC 803. This is a civil appeal \nso the complainant’s name is given frst: this is the party bringing the action. The second name is that of the party defending the action. In an appeal case the party bringing the appeal is the frst name given. When the case is located you will note that it was fnally heard in the House of Lords. \nCorrectly citing law cases before and after 2001 \nThere are a few general rules concerning what information goes into citations before and after the introduction of neutral citations by the courts in 2001 and these are set out in Table 6 .3. \n\n--- Page 186 ---\n   \n  \n  \n      \n  \n    \n      FINDING MATERIAL 155 \nTABLE 6.3 CORRECTLY CITING LAW CASES BEFORE AND AFTER 2001 \nType of report Cases before 2001 Cases after 2001 \nReported cases • Party names \n• Law report citation \nIn order of the hierarchy of law \nreporting if more than one e.g. George Mitchell v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd  [1983] 2 AC 803; \n[1983] 3 WLR 163; [1983] 2 All E.R. 737; [1983] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 272; [1983] Com.

They also give you a summary of the facts of the case and its outcome. This is useful when you are engaging in research as they have a subject search and will list cases relevant to topics. You can then read summaries of located cases to decide their relevance before locating them. Table 6 .4 considers search strategies for locating law reports in three \npublications: \n(1) The current law case citatory. \n(2) The law reports consolidated index. \n(3) The digest. \nHow to locate cases online \nLaw cases are collected together in databases that work by linking words, so that you can do a keyword search to retrieve resources according to the keywords you use. You can think of a database as a cross-referenced address book, where each word has an ‘address’: the computer links and cross-references until it fnds the address or potential addresses called up by your search terms. \n\n--- Page 187 ---\n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n           156 FINDING MATERIAL  \nTABLE 6.4 HOW TO LOCATE LAW REPORTS INFANT COLLECTIONS \nNAME OF PUBLICATION DESCRIPTION \nCURRENT LAW CASE CITATOR In three-date sets 1947–1976 1977– 1988 1989–2002 NB: current law is also online on Westlaw as the case and legislation locators • Each case is given a case number that \nlists parties in alphabetical order by frst party, and criminal cases are listed by R and then alphabetical \n• Gives a case summary of the facts and \njudgment as well as useful information about the procedural history of a case \n• At end of citations for a particular case \nlocation indicated by word Digested followed by numbers, e.g. 10,170.

Alternatively if you are searching by a case name you want a thorough search to ensure the law in that case has not been changed by subsequent cases. \nThe range of databases give access to differing law report series over different time -\nscales, and they may give access to the offcial transcript of the court as well as reports. It will take time for you to learn which report series can be located on which database. \nMake yourself familiar with each of the sites as soon as you can. Some subscription \nsites may not be available in your institution. You are likely to fnd that your institution’s library provides guides to the databases that it subscribes to. Additionally, most sites have help tabs as well as tutorials for those who are new to the database. Westlaw, for example, offers printed training material. \nMost universities have access to subscription databases such as Westlaw, Justis or \nLexisNexis. None of these carry the full range of law reports and you will fnd that you will need to access all of them if possible. An important free access database to be aware of is BAILII ( www.bailii.org ), which covers England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland \nand the EU. Table 6 .5 gives you basic information on the holdings of the database and its \nsearch facilities. \nThe particular value of databases such as Westlaw or LexisNexis is that in addition to \nthe law report you will fnd a case summary provided, and where relevant a list of case notes or articles written about the case, and later cases referring to it. Westlaw also pro -\nvides access to the court transcript of the judgment. Table 6 .5 gives you more detailed \ninformation on accessing cases on several databases. The following pages also show you screenshots of several of the main law case databases. Her Majesty’s Courts Service (HMCS) publishes Court of Appeal and Supreme Court judgments within one day; with other courts and tribunals they are published as soon as possible. It is an important data -\nbase because it also allows you to search for cases coming to court, and notes which cases have applied for leave to appeal. \nAs you can see, there are plenty of databases, and you will need to check which one \nyour library has access to. These change their interface and search options regularly, so it would not make much sense to describe them in detail in a book. It is quite likely that your library website will provide help such as video tutorials or explanations, and your librarian can also help you understand the fner details. Many universities also have rep -\nresentatives for the major providers like Westlaw or LexisNexis – often students that have received specialist training and are happy to support you. \nEuropean cases \nYou will be referred to cases relating to the law of the EU and the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) (the Council of Europe institution dealing with disputes \n\n--- Page 189 ---\n   \n    \n     \n \n     \n 158 FINDING MATERIAL  \nTABLE 6.5 HOW TO LOCATE LAW REPORTS: ONLINE DATABASES\nDATABASES AND STANDARD INFORMATION CONTENTS: SEARCH FACILITIES \n(e.g. Keyword, f rst party search etc.) \nBAILIIFREE SERVICE <www.bailii.org> Contents:Contain case law from England, Wales, Scotland and the European Union Keyword, f rst party, topic search etc. \nCASETRACKSUBSCRIPTION SERVICE <www.casetrack.com>Provider: Merrill Legal Solutions [they are the only off cial transcribers for the Court of Appeal and Administrative Court and one of the off cial transcribers for the High Court, which means that judgments can appear therefore in a matter of hours] Contents:Contain judgments from the last 14 years in excess of 80,000 judgments [variable start dates for each court, however]: Court of Appeal Criminal and Civil divisions 4/96 – current.

This section gives you basic information \nto help you to locate these cases. \nLocating European Union law cases \nLocating cases in print collections \nUnlike the English legal system the EU legal system does have an offcial set of law \nreports – the ‘Law reports before the Court’ which since 1991 are organised in two parts. Part I reports cases heard in the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU), and Part II reports cases of the Court of First Instance/General Court. In the English legal system publi -\ncation of appellate courts and trial court judgments is relatively quick, as discussed. Unfortunately, there is not a quick turnaround of the offcial reports for EU courts. Part of this is due to the need to translate judgments into the offcial languages of the EU (cur -\nrently 21!), and this can take in the region of 18–24 months. This means that the offcial reports are not a useful source for up to date law. Researchers and lawyers needing up to date information on cases must consult private publishers, and as you know now these collections will not be comprehensive but will only cover cases considered impor -\ntant by the editors. \nThere are two main sources of reliable but unoffcial private publications: the Common \nMarket Law Reports which have been published since 1962 by Sweet and Maxwell and the All England Law Reports (European cases), which have been published since 1995. \nLocating cases online \nThere are a range of databases that give details of EU cases. The most important is the offcial database, https://curia.europa.eu, where you can search for the parties (e.g. ‘van Gend’) for the citation (see below), or via the ‘Advanced search’ feature for more complex information – e.g. all cases on Consumer Protection between 1990 and 2005. \n\n--- Page 192 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   FINDING MATERIAL 161 \nUnderstanding EU case citations \nCases in the CJEU and Court of First Instance (previously the General Court and renamed \nby the Treaty of Lisbon) are reported as two different series: the CJEU as series C and the CFI (GC) as series T. The frst aspect of the citation therefore is stating the series classifca -\ntion as either C or T. This is followed by the year of hearing separated by a forward slash from the serial number of the case, which indicates which case of the hearing year it was. This is similar to the idea of sequence numbers used in neutral citations for domestic cases referred to above. Next the names of the parties to the case are given. After the party names the year recorded in square brackets indicates the year of publication of the offcial record; this is followed by the abbreviated reference ECR to the offcial reports noting in capitalised Roman numerals whether the case is in Part I (CJEU cases) or Part II (CFI/GC). Knowing the part numbers enables you to tell at a glance which court heard the case reported. \nLocating ECHR law reports \nThere exist both offcial and unoffcial reports of cases, and it is important to remember that in addition to the ECtHR, the European Commission on Human Rights had jurisdic -\ntion to hear cases until its abolition in 1998. \nPrint collection \nThere is an offcial print series of reports for the ECtHR which is located in the ‘Reports of Judgments and Decisions’. Most recently there has been a move towards the publication of selected cases only. There is a delay of at least a year before publication. \nResearchers, lawyers and students therefore are again reliant on private publishers for \nup to date information on cases, using the European Human Rights Reports (EHRR). They are acceptable in the English and Welsh courts. \nIf you need access to decisions of the European Commission on Human Rights pre -\n1998, these can be located in two reports series that are split by date. The collection of decisions of the European Commission on Human Rights (citation is CD) contains reports from 1955 to 1973 in Volumes 1–46. From 1974 to 1998, reports can be found in the Decisions and Reports (citation DR) in Volume 46 onwards. \nHUDOC \nHUDOC is the offcial website, containing full judgments which are free to access ( hudoc \n.echr.coe.int/ ). However, you can also access selected cases through the subscription \nservices of Westlaw, Justis, Lawtel and Casetrack. \nFinding secondary material \nIntroduction \nReading secondary texts (books about law) is essential for the development of your understanding of law. There are many types of secondary texts available from the print \n\n--- Page 193 ---\n \n 162 FINDING MATERIAL  \nand e-collections in your university library as well as on open access internet sites. An \nexample of the type of texts available would include: \n  Reference texts: dictionaries, encyclopaedias, digests, indexes, bibliographies. \n  Books/research monographs. \n  Academic and professional journal articles. \n  Offcial documents (command papers, proceedings in Parliament, debates in \nParliament, parliamentary research papers, government presentations to Parliament in the form of policies, briefngs, information and minutes of committees). \n  Reports by charitable organisations in the feld. \n  Reports by independent ‘think tanks’. \n  A large number of organisations, such as charities, universities and pressure groups have extensive literature online. \n  Many universities around the world make some aspects of their electronic materials available free on the internet. \n  Some individual academics in university departments make their speeches, lectures and articles available and often have their own websites. \n  Media reporting. \n  Blogs. \nAs students of law studying for a law degree you are engaged in the academic stage of a legal education. Among other things in your learning you are required to keep up to date with some of the latest academic thought in your area. Academic journals and books critique an area of law, explain the emergence of a new idea or area of law or offer an academic commentary on an area of law. These materials can bring exceptional scholar -\nship to a reader. Where they are concerned with actual legal rules you will need to check that the commentary and the rule given in the book are up to date. \nYour library will subscribe to journals and reference material and in many cases these \nwill be available in both print and electronic formats. Many journals will provide electronic access to current and back issues if your library has a print subscription. Journal articles are never more than two to four months out of date at the date of publication. \nUnfortunately, the world of academic publishing is complex. There are plenty of elec -\ntronic databases and collections that your library will have subscribed to, and there are plenty that it will not. These each contain a variety of journals, depending on the agree -\nment between the databases and the publishers. Often, your library website will have a search function as well, which points you to which of the databases your library sub -\nscribes to contains this particular journal. \nAs you move through the frst year of your studies you will gain an appreciation of the \nimportance of secondary law texts, both from textbooks that explain the general area of law, through to scholarly books which carefully explore one area of law from a complex set of perspectives. As with primary sources, you should also assess whether the author of a secondary text has appropriate credentials. \n\n--- Page 194 ---\n   \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n FINDING MATERIAL 163 \nBooks written as student textbooks, such as this one, are not books of any legal \nauthority. Some do get mentioned in court (especially the older and more established \nones), but it is not common practice. Books can be out of date before they are published so you do need to consult academic journals for up to date legal commentary. \nThe majority of the journals that you will read will be academic. This means all articles \nplaced in a particular edition of the journal will have been read before publication by two other academics working in the same area, who must agree that the article is academi -\ncally sound and adds to the current debates. This process is called peer review, and the journals which undertake this checking prior to publication are called refereed journals. The peer-review process ensures that the article and the journal are reliable. This does not mean that what is said should be believed or should not be questioned, but it does mean that you can read it and trust it to be of an authoritative nature. \nOther journals are professional and not intended in any way to be academic but prac -\ntical. Some of these can be extremely useful for law students at the academic stage of their training, but bear in mind that there is often no peer-review process involved in the publication. \nGeneral issues \nWilliam Twining, a well-known professor of philosophy, once issued a text that he called the Law Cookbook , a series of ‘recipes’ for success in legal method and reasoning.\n14 \nThis developed into a popular text, co-authored with Professor David Miers, How To Do Things With Rules .\n15 \nThe ‘cookbook’ is an excellent metaphor,16 especially related to electronic and com -\nplex print texts. You may not wish to cook, but if you did, you would not start off by cook -\ning the most complex recipe or by simply reading recipes. You would learn the basics of cooking and then add on more complex variants to your simple starting recipes. With time, you will discover your own ways of cooking depending on the meal you are pre -\nparing. This is the underlying approach of this section, to lay out some basic research strategies, or recipes, for searching print and electronic collections, to acquire secondary material about the law. \nIt will allow you to experiment and provide the tools you need to gain an understanding \nof law library research. You will learn best by going into the print collections, or logging into the electronic collections, and browsing the sources. \nAcademic study involves the application of proper and rigorous research for materials, \nfollowed by your selection of the most appropriate resources, which are then subjected to competent and rigorous interpretation.\n17 The effort taken to locate material is only the \nbeginning of academic work, but it is an essential task because you need to locate the most authoritative and correct texts. \nAs you practise locating secondary material you will fnd that your skills increase and \nimprove. In addition to the face-to-face training that your department and/or library will \n14 W Twining and D Miers How to Do Things with Rules: A Primer of Interpretation (4th edition, Cambridge \nUniversity Press , Cambridge, 1999), Appendix 111, 421–33. \n15 W Twining and D Miers How to Do Things with Rules: A Primer of Interpretation (4th edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1999). \n16 A metaphor can be defned as the act of describing something unknown by reference to something known. \n17 Analysis and interpretation of retrieved material will be dealt with later in the book. \n\n--- Page 195 ---\n \n \n \n \n 164 FINDING MATERIAL  \nprovide, there are excellent training guides produced by most university libraries to assist \nin locating and searching particular print and electronic resources. In addition, many data -\nbases such as Westlaw contain detailed instructions both in print format, and online. All databases will contain either help tutorials or ‘hints’ in a drop-down menu. These can be useful if you have a problem. But it is better to also know how to properly navigate the site. \nSearch strategies \nSearch strategies for print and electronic materials both start in the same place, with your research question and an idea of the type of information you are looking for. You need to assess whether the material you have located is reliable and, in the case of journal arti -\ncles, that it is the most current scholarly material. You may fnd that you retrieve articles by leading scholars that are opposed to each other in their views. You need to deal with this difference of opinion and synthesise these views in your writing and research for tuto -\nrials. However, frst things frst: before you can engage in this type of critique you need to know how to locate the best, and most relevant, materials you need with a carefully thought out strategy based on: \n  what you are looking for; and \n  why you are looking for it. \nFor the following discussion on searching for resources we will assume that you are \nresearching for the following essay question: \nIs it correct to maintain that in R v Secretary of State ex. P. Factortame (No 1) and (No \n2) the English courts and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) made it clear that English courts have the power to suspend Acts of Parliament conficting with the European Union (EU) and that the CJEU can determine what national remedies should be available? Critically discuss. \nThis is an essay based on the reading of law reports and from the previous sections \nyou know how to locate these cases. However, your ultimate task is to decide whether the description given in the quote is correct. To do this, you will need to search for relevant secondary material, which must be mainly from academics. The views of legal profes -\nsionals as well as politicians can sometimes give your research some extra avenues to explore and views to consider. But at university you are primarily responding from an academic legal perspective not a professional legal and/or political perspective. We will look at only three types of secondary text, journals, books and offcial documents. \nJournal articles \nWhat are journals? \nA journal is a collection of articles (and book reviews and case comments) by a range of different writers. Law journals can cover the area of law generally or consider law from a \n\n--- Page 196 ---\n   \n \n       FINDING MATERIAL 165 \nspecifc disciplinary perspective (such as anthropology or sociology) or from one specifc \narea of law (e.g. contract or criminal law). The main focus of a journal can be academic or non-academic (e.g. a professional journal for barristers or solicitors). Law students are always expected to use several academic articles in written work and for tutorial work which may be supplemented by non-academic professional journal articles if relevant. Academic articles are scholarly pieces written about a particular topic or issue within a subject and often constitute the most up to date thinking in an area. \nJournal title abbreviations \nAll journals have an abbreviation of the journal title (e.g. CLR for the Cambridge Law Review) and you will come to know the main abbreviations. The abbreviation can usually be found in the header of each page of an article, and a full listing of abbreviations can be obtained online from the Cardiff Index to Legal Abbreviations.\n18 \nJournal article citations \nPublishers of journals need a recognised system of organising their journals so that they can be easily accessed by readers in their printed formats as well as online. This is essen -\ntially done by date order of publication. Typically, each year will have its own volume, going back to the beginning of the journal. The majority of academic journals are pub -\nlished more than once a year in ‘issues’. Therefore many volume numbers will be followed by a number in brackets; this indicates which issue of the year the article is in (e.g. 72(1) refers to Volume 72 and Issue No 1 for the year). \nThe citation for a journal article is ordered as follows: author name, article title, abbre -\nviation of journal name, year of publication, volume number, issue number in brackets and page reference: \nMunday R, Fisher v Bell revisited: misjudging the legislative craft, CLJ 2013, 72(1), \n50–64 \nAs you can probably work out yourself, this is an article by R. Munday with the title ‘Fisher v Bell revisited: misjudging the legislative craft’. It was published in Issue 1 of Volume 72 of the Cambridge Law Journal  in 2013, and you can fnd it on pages 50–64. \nDo not confuse the general citation used by each journal with the requirements of \nacademic referencing systems for use in the written work method of placing such refer -\nences into essays, etc. There are several different academic referencing systems used in universities (e.g. Harvard or the Oxford System for the Citation of Legal Authorities (OSCOLA)). These may require you to use slightly differing punctuation, fonts or presen -\ntation of author name and journal details \nSee Chapter 10 for fuller details on academic referencing. \n18 www.legalabbrevs.cardiff.ac.uk . \n\n--- Page 197 ---\n \n \n \n \n 166 FINDING MATERIAL  \nFinding online journals using Westlaw \nWhilst print runs of certain journals are currently kept by many university libraries, as a \ngeneral trend universities are moving to online access only. This saves valuable space on the library shelves, and it allows students to access the journal articles whenever they want and wherever they are, without the frustration of walking to the shelf only to discover that someone else has taken it to their desk already. \nWestlaw is not only useful for cases and legislation but can also be used to search \njournals for relevant articles by: \n  keywords; \n  subject; \n  general terms; \n  cases cited in the journal article; \n  journal title; \n  article title; \n  author. \nIt is relatively straightforward to use the quick search box to locate a specifc journal \narticle by name or by author name. But you may well fnd that often you are searching to see if an article has been written on a particular topic. The keyword search allows you to do this. But do not assume that there are no articles if you do not retrieve any. Your keywords may not have retrieved articles that exist; changing your keywords may allow you to locate the articles you want. When you retrieve your search results you will fnd that either the title is clearly relevant or you may need to read the abstract. If you have not used an advanced search to narrow the publication dates of articles you wish to retrieve, do keep a careful eye on dates as you do not want to locate out of date information. Westlaw is useful in that it keeps a list of journals in full text on the site and additionally refers to journals in the abstract where it does not have full text. \nFinding journals on Lawtel \nThis site is also a Sweet and Maxwell site so it will contain some material that is also found on Westlaw. However, it tends to specialise more in the area of professional legal journals, which can be particularly useful in ensuring you know the lawyers’ views of up to date law as well as reading academic views. It too can be searched by using keywords, by subject, general text (free text) or by journal title or author, and your searches can be date limited. \nFinding journals on Lexis®Library \nThis database contains the full text of around 100 journals and the abstracts of many more; it also contains practitioner journals. You can search within one specifc journal, \n\n--- Page 198 ---\n   \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n FINDING MATERIAL 167 \nwhich is particularly useful and is a facility that is not available on Westlaw. But do not get \ninto the habit of just using one journal. Even if your preferred journal is excellent it cannot give you the wide-ranging understanding obtained by looking at good academic articles from a range of journals. Many generalist journals contain in-depth articles on a range of topics. If you were researching criminal law and limited yourself to just the criminal law review you may miss an important article in one of the generalist journals such as the journal of legal studies. \nFinding journals on HeinOnline ( www.heinonline.org) \nThis is a database from Hein and Co, a leading American publisher; however, it contains a large number of UK and European journals. It will retrieve your journal as a page image so you see the article as it appeared in the print version. \nThere is a good source of archived academic journal articles held on JSTOR, which \nis a subscription database that you will be able to access through your university library. \nHowever, these are out of date and so you must decide if you need up to date infor -\nmation on an area of law. If you are interested in various academic views relating to a topic then these may be of use, as long as you also use them with updated articles as well. \nUsing other search engines \nAnother very popular way to fnd articles is Google Scholar – https://scholar.google.com. It is very easy to use and shows you articles from a huge number of sources. Often, it will contain links to a pdf version of an article that is published in open access repositories – sometimes draft versions or articles or articles that were only licensed to a publisher for a certain time. Try to use the offcially published version for your writing, as the page refer -\nences in the open access copy might be skewed. In general, be very careful to ensure that what you are retrieving is a proper academic source that has undergone the peer-review process. As mentioned before, you can fnd everything from brilliant research papers to hastily typed conspiracy theories on the internet, and search engines like Google Scholar do not always distinguish between these. \nThe library catalogue \nOften the best way to locate journal articles is your own library’s website. Many library catalogues can not only be used to locate books (see below), but will also have excel -\nlent search facilities for journals. The advantage is that you will only get links to articles that your library has access to, and that you often have links leading you straight to the relevant database (an article might be available on HeinOnline and not on Lexis, for example). \n\n--- Page 199 ---\n \n   \n \n 168 FINDING MATERIAL  \nBooks \nIn addition to journal articles you will also be required to read all or part of a number of \nbooks for each of your modules. You need to know how to access them effciently, either by title, or by researching to see if there are any books of authority on the topic you are concerned with. \nThe library catalogue \nThe print collection of your university library is going to be your main source of books for borrowing or reading and therefore your frst port of call will again be the online library cataloguing system. \nIt is possible with a note from your university library to have reading rights in other \nuniversity libraries. This is most useful if you are studying some distance from your home address: you may be able, out of term time, to read books in any good university law library near your home. Additionally if your library does not stock the book you need, you can fll in an interlibrary loan form, but it can take weeks before your book arrives in your university library. \nThe university online library catalogue will allow you to access books by title, author or \nthe use of keywords. Each university catalogue system will work differently; however, all will contain print or online guides to the system. Again this is an area where you should experiment with accessing books on topics early on in the academic year so that you know how to fnd books when told to read a chapter. \nA valuable online resource for accessing books is COPAC ( www.copac.ac.uk ), which \nis an amalgamation of the online catalogues of major UK as well as Ireland, specialist, university and national libraries (e.g. The British Library). You can fnd some interesting material in this catalogue, including small specialist monographs that are not in your university’s library. \nUsing print-only materials \nYou can also locate books using printed materials by accessing a legal bibliography, which can be general or specialist, and when you have a book in front of you, you can consult its bibliography and may well obtain leads for further reading from it. Or check out the references in footnotes or endnotes in your set text or other books. You might fnd that the textbook may only give a basic outline of an area, but if you look at footnotes you will often fnd that they direct you to further, more detailed, reading. \nGeneral note on module ‘set textbooks’ \nSome lecturers will advise you to buy a particular book for a module. If this is the case, do seriously consider buying the book if your fnances will allow you to do so. This textbook \n\n--- Page 200 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n     FINDING MATERIAL 169 \nwill have been carefully chosen by your lecturer as the best and most up to date book to accompany the course. You will fnd that you will often be expected to read a section or a chapter before a tutorial or a lecture. You may think it will be enough to read the library copy of the set text. Whilst this may be sensible, if many students decide to do this you may fnd that you cannot get your hands on the book to read it for assessments or tutorials. \nIf you decide you want to use a different textbook do check with your lecturer that \nit is appropriate. Your lecturer may have decided not to use that book for very specifc reasons. For example, it may not cover all of the topics on the course. Alternatively, you may feel that the set textbook is too diffcult, or you cannot follow it. Do ask your lecturer for advice as they may be able to recommend another text to use instead, or to read frst before going back to the set text you have a problem with. \nYou can often buy used textbooks, but do make sure that the version you are buying \nis up to date. If it is an older edition of the recommended book, check with your lecturer whether this will still be suffcient. \nEven if you do buy the recommended textbook this does not mean that you will not \nhave to locate and read other books when researching for tutorials or assessments. \nOffcial documents \nThe use of the term ‘offcial document’ refers to publications by the two Houses of Parliament (command papers, parliamentary papers, debates, committee proceedings), the government and government departments, local authorities, etc. If you are research -\ning legislation the parliamentary website\n19 or relevant government or government depart -\nment website20 can offer an invaluable insight into the rationale for proposed legislation. \nFor the purposes of this discussion we will only consider accessing a few offcial \ndocuments: \n  Command papers. \n  Parliamentary papers. \n  Parliamentary debates. \nBut the information given can be transferable and act as a standard guide to access other \ntypes of offcial documents. \nCommand papers \nWhen the government presents publications to Parliament they are known as command papers, so called because of the following formula of words at the beginning of them: \n‘Presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for … by Command of Her Majesty’. \n19 www.parliament.uk . \n20 www.gov.uk . \n\n--- Page 201 ---\n \n  170 FINDING MATERIAL  \nThere are many different types of command paper. You have already come across two, \nWhite Papers and Green Papers, in Chapters 1 and 7. White Papers present the govern -\nment’s proposals for legislation, or policy initiatives. Green Papers tend to be purely con -\nsultation documents. In addition to these command papers also include: \n  State papers. \n  Government responses to select committee reports. \n  Reports of Royal Commissions as well as other committees of inquiry. \n  Statistics and annual reports of government bodies (but not all). \nThe majority of command papers are kept in series identifable by numbers. In addition \nto numbered series there are some command papers that are not in numbered series. \nThe numbered series of command papers began in 1833; the sixth series, which \nbegan in November 1986, is the current series. \nThe full range of dates and references for the six series are as follows: \nSeries 1: 1833–1869, which is numbered [1]–[4222]. Series 2: 1870–1899, which starts with prefx C. and is numbered [1]–[9550]. Series 3: 1900–1918, which starts with the prefx Cd. and is numbered [1]–[9329]. Series 4: 1919–1956, which starts with the prefx Cmd and is numbered [1]–[9889]. (Square \nbrackets around numbers was abolished in 1922.) \nSeries 5: 1956–1986, which starts with the prefx Cmnd and is numbered [1]–[9927]. Series 6: 1986 to date. \nNote that after the frst series, prefxes are added to differentiate the series so that num -\nbers do not become confused. If you refer to a command paper by the number 2,500, it \nwill not mean anything unless you know the prefx. If it is Cmd 2500, you know that the prefx Cmd was used for Series 4. Therefore it can be located in Series 4. \nYou may fnd that your library organises its collection of command papers according \nto the parliamentary session. This is a problem if you do not know the date of the com -\nmand paper you are looking for. \nAs command papers are offcial government publications, most of them can be located \nin full text on the www.gov.uk website. \nIf you want to see the government’s response to any select committee reports these \nare accessible by consulting the relevant committee pages or through links on the rel -\nevant government department websites. \nLocating parliamentary papers \nHouse of Commons papers and House of Lords papers detail the work of the two Houses, for example, details of voting procedures, minutes, select committee reports. \n\n--- Page 202 ---\n   \n  \n   \n  \n  \n             \n 171 FINDING MATERIAL \nThe Parliament website21 gives the dates and online access for a range of parliamen -\ntary papers. Some are not available online and where this is the case it is stated. From the \nparliament.uk site you can click on each link to immediately access papers. \nFinding reports of parliamentary debates \nWhilst many reports may be given of debates in Parliament, the only offcial reports of parliamentary debates are provided by Hansard, and generally the shorthand reference for offcial reports of debates is just ‘Hansard’. It is printed on a daily basis and reprinted each week in the ‘weekly Hansard’ and an index is published fortnightly. At the end of each parliamentary session all debates are issued as a bound volume; these volumes run into the hundreds. Hansard reports are in a column (two to a page) format, with each column numbered consecutively throughout the year so that passages can be precisely and quickly pinpointed. For referencing purposes the volume number and column num -\nber is given. \nThey are published online at hansard.parliament.uk, where you can look at both \nCommons and Lords debates. You can search by dates, but the current online record only goes back to 1988/9 (House of Commons) and 1994/94 (House of Lords). For online records before that you would need to use the parliamentary archives at hansard-archive .parliament.uk. \nEvaluation of material \nAccess to information has probably changed more radically than most other things over the past 20 years. Nothing is easier than to fnd a plethora of materials for almost any question. \nThe temptation is therefore high to replace complicated and time-consuming research \nwith a few phrases typed into the online search engine of your choice. However, you need to be very careful here. There is an enormous amount of carelessly researched, strongly opinionated or biased and sometimes even outright wrong information on the internet, and you will not receive good marks if you base your arguments on this. \nThe articles you fnd in academic journals have gone through a robust peer-review \nprocess, where other academics review the articles in detail before they are published. This does not mean everything is defnitely correct, and it certainly does not mean that you have to share the opinions of the writers, but it does mean that you can trust the methods used to reach the conclusions. \nWith a lot of online writing, there is no way to ensure similar standards, so you need to \nassess the reliability of the sources yourself. Essentially, you need to ask yourself three questions: \n21 Accessed 5 January 2015. \n\n--- Page 203 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 172 FINDING MATERIAL  \n  Who has posted this – who is the author or the organisation publishing this, are they \ntrustworthy, what are their credentials? \n  Why have they posted it – is the author part of a campaign group or part of a lobby -\ning organisation, is there an intention behind it? As an example, you need to read an article about climate change differently whether it comes from an environmentalist group or from the oil industry. Even if both use the same facts, the conclusions drawn from those are very likely going to be quite different. \n  When was it posted – is the information still up to date? Especially in law, this can change at a rapid pace! \nIt is important that you develop a good feeling for sources. A website that offers one-paragraph summaries of 20 cases in the law of torts is probably not a good revision guide, as the information is too short and probably full of mistakes. A website that gives free samples of essays that students can buy almost certainly contains sloppy research and badly written ideas. Wikipedia is a fantastic example for collaboration on the internet, and often a great source of information to get an overview of a topic, but it is impossible to trace the content back to the author and to assess the reliability of it. \nWebsites of newspapers or news organisations (even reliable sources such as The \nGuardian or the BBC) will – because of their target audiences – never give you the amount of depth you require for writing a successful law essay. Using the BBC’s website is fne if you want to give a source to facts, opinion polls or historical records, but it is not enough for formulating a strong legal argument. \nCONCLUSION \nThis chapter should give you enough starting points to begin researching for your semi -\nnars and assignments. All of this looks probably a bit much at the moment, but in no time it will become your second nature. Try practising fnding legislation, cases and articles early on, and embrace every opportunity to get more familiar with the different worlds your library can give you access to – both in paper and online. \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \nGeneral \n  The study of law is exclusively the study of documents containing the law (primary sources) and books and other resources about the law (secondary sources). \n  The law library functions as a major gateway to help you fnd your source materials in both print and electronic form. \n\n--- Page 204 ---\n   FINDING MATERIAL 173 \n  There are particular conventions for citing primary law, and for the hierarchy of law \nreports, that should be observed. \n  Electronic databases can be particularly useful tools if you do not know the citation of a specifc case. \n  A law case is a court hearing of a legal dispute. \n  A court transcript is the written record of the judgments delivered in court compiled by an employee of the court. \n  Case law is the term used to refer to decided legal disputes in the courts in which there has been the creation of, or an amendment to, a common law rule by judges in their judicial decisions during the hearing of the case. \n  A legal authority is a law case that in its written form (which can be a court transcript or a privately published report) creates a precedent. \n  A law report is a written record of a law case produced by a private law report pub -\nlisher. There are no offcial English legal system law reports. \n  The following hierarchy of law reports emerges from practice directions:  Law Reports  series (ICLR). \n Weekly Law Reports or All England Law Reports. \n An authoritative specialist series. \n  Since 2001 every approved judgment in the Supreme Court, Privy Council, Court of Appeal, the Administrative Court, and latterly the divisions of the High Court (Chancery, Queen’s Bench, Commercial, Admiralty, Family, etc.) has been given a neutral citation by the court. \n  The neutral citation is completely independent of any private law report citations. \n  The year date given in a citation is the year in which the case was reported. You need to be aware that it is possible that the case itself may not have been heard  in that \nyear. \n  Case names are cited in different ways according to whether they are criminal, civil or judicial review cases, family law cases, probate cases or shipping cases. \n  When citing reported cases before 2001 you must give party names and the law report citation (in order of the hierarchy of law reporting if more than one). \n  If citing reported cases after 2001 you must give party names, neutral citation and law report citations (in order of the hierarchy of law reporting if more than one). \n  If citing unreported cases before 2001, you must give party names, date of hearing and court. \n  If citing unreported cases after 2001, you must give party names and neutral citation. \n  Justis is a particularly useful database for research as it contains case law going back to 1163 and legislation back to 1235 for not only the UK but also Ireland and the EU. \n  Her Majesty’s Courts Service publishes Court of Appeal and Supreme Court judg -\nments within one day, with other courts and tribunals as soon as possible. \n  European Union treaties can be found at EUR-Lex, European Union cases can be located on Curia. \n\n--- Page 205 ---\n 174 FINDING MATERIAL  \n  Decisions by the European Court of Human Rights can be found using the HUDOC \nwebsite. \n  An essential aspect of the study of law is the location and use of secondary texts about law. \n  You need to develop effcient and competent research strategies for secondary texts. \nJournal articles \n  A journal is a collection of articles (and book reviews and case comments) by a range of different writers. Law journals can cover the area of law generally or consider law from a specifc disciplinary perspective. \n  Westlaw, Lawtel, Lexis®Library and HeinOnline are all good sources for journals.

This chapter will deal with domestic legislation\n1 and mainly focuses on pri -\nmary legislation, the ‘Public General Act’, which will be referred to as a ‘statute’. However, the skills you will learn are transferable to secondary legislation and to other types of primary legislation.\n2 \nThe standard layout of domestic legislation will be briefy noted,3 before turning to \nconsider the range of techniques and skills needed to competently handle legislation. You will be introduced to various techniques for understanding the language of legislation and the statute as a whole. Finally the role of statutory interpretation will be explored. \nYour skills in all areas will be tested and developed through guided exercises and \nquestions related to specifc legislation. Practice will allow you to steadily increase your intellectual awareness, language appreciation, and skills of prediction concerning inter -\npretation diffculties. These skills will allow you to develop the ability to evaluate and critique legislation and use it to construct legal arguments. \nThere are a number of skills that need to be utilised together to properly understand \nand handle legislation. These are set out below in Figure 7 .1. \n1 C hapter 3 deals with European Union legislation. \n2 S ee Chapter 1 for a detailed consideration of primary and secondary legislation. \n3 S ee Chapter 1 for a detailed consideration of layout of legislation. \n\n--- Page 208 ---\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 177 \nTHE LAYOUT OF A STATUTE \nCentral to the analysis of statutes is the ability to understand how the statute is structured \nas a whole, and what the relationship is between the different areas of the statute. As discussed in detail in Chapter 1 there is a standard method of laying out statutes which, when recognised and understood, is helpful for analysis. \nA statute is generally divided into a preamble, parts, sections and Schedules. In \nsmaller statutes, parts and/or Schedules may not be used. \nEach part will deal with different aspects of the overall collection of legal rules and \ntheir meanings contained in the statute. These parts can be subdivided into several chap -\nters. Each part and any chapters are divided into sections (often abbreviated as ‘s’ (sin -\ngular) or ‘ss’ (plural)) which give more details in each area. \nAs appropriate, sections will set out legal rules, and deal with defnitions and adminis -\ntrative matters. Sections can be further divided with the use of Arabic numerals into sub -\nsections (abbreviated as ‘sub-s’ (singular) or ‘sub-ss’ (plural)). Sub-sections are capable of further division, with the use of Roman numerals, into paragraphs (abbreviated as ‘para’ (singular) or ‘paras’ (plural)). Paragraphs can be further divided with alphabetical ordering into sub-paragraphs (abbreviated as ‘sub-para’ (singular) or ‘sub-paras’ (plural)). \nSections are used to simplify navigation through the statute, and section numbering runs \nconsecutively across any divisions into ‘parts’ or ‘chapters’. They are not used in Schedules. \nAt the end of the statute, there will often be Schedules (a capital ‘S’ is always used) \nand these are numerically divided as well. These deal with matters raised in the various parts, perhaps setting out administrative procedures to be observed or defnitions to be applied. But note that Schedules can also contain defnitions. Schedules only relate in some manner to previous sections in the Act. They cannot create anything new. \nStatutes also contain marginal notes, headings and sub-headings. These are organising \ndevices and are not part of the law. You will recall that the words in a statute setting out legal rules are referred to as ‘rules in a fxed legal format’. Only those words carry the law. \nCorrect understanding of the relationship between the different areas of the statute ena -\nbles the general layout of the Act to be ascertained. Assistance is also obtained from the ‘long title’ of the Act (which looks more like a long sentence describing the area covered by the Act). Figure 7 .2 shows the differing elements of a statute with a brief explanation of each one. \nUSING AND HANDLING A STATUTE \nUsually you will only need to deal with a few sections in a statute. It is always useful, how -\never, to be aware of the general purpose of the statute. The sections you are analysing and applying can then be seen as part of a whole. It is also important to know how the parts of a statute ft together, and understand when sections are connected to each other and should be read together and when they are not. \n\n--- Page 209 ---\n    \n \n  \n  178 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \n• Law in ÿxed verbal form ena cted by UK Parliament \n• Ref erred to by sho rt title \nPREAMBLE STATUTE \n• Each section may be divided into smaller numbered sub-sections using\n   Arabic numerals enclosed with brackets e.g. (1) \n• Sub-sections may come with Margins and Headers; these do not form pa rt of\n  the law PARTS \nSECTIONS \nSUB-SEC TIONS \nPARAGRAPHS \nSUB \nPARAGRAPHS \nSCHEDULES • First name of monarch • Long title of Ac t \n• Date of royal assent • Words of enact ment \n• A statute will usually be divided into a series of Parts (not all ar e, par ticularl y\n   if they are short statutes) • Each Part will tend to refer to a di °erent topic are a \n• Parts may come with Margins and Headers; these do not form part of the law \n• Each part is divided into smaller numbered sections using Arabic numerals. \n• Sometimes, when a statute is amended and sections are inser ted,\n  capitalised alpha markers are used e.g. A • Sections may come with Margins and Headers; these do not form pa rt of the law \n• Each sub-section may be divided into smaller paragraphs using Roman\n   numerals enclosed within brackets e.g. (ii) \n• Paragraphs may come with Margins and Headers; these do not form pa rt of\n   the law \n• Each paragraph may be divided into smaller sub -paragraphs using lower\n   case alphabetical markers enclosed within brackets e.g. (a) \n• Sub-paragraphs may come with Margin and Headers; these do not form part \nof the law \n• Makes further arrangements , or gives fur ther information concerning matters\n  already mentioned in sections.

They also make decisions about the choice of language. Drafters try to ensure that as far as possible the language used in the statute is clear and general, making it both understandable and capable of being applied to new, but connected, situations. Generality of statutory language can cause interpretational issues. \nLegislation can be described as legal rules created in a ‘fxed verbal form’. The \nphrase ‘fxed verbal form’ means that only those  exact words in that order, as enacted by \nParliament, form the legal rule. We will come back to this point when we discuss statutory interpretation by the judiciary.\n4 \nWhen you are dealing with sections in a statute it is important to be aware that these \nsections are part of a collection of rules in the statute and they are linked by the fact that they deal with similar issues. You will need to fnd out which words or phrases used in sections have attached defnitions or defences and if there are any guidelines given in the statute affecting the application of a particular section. These can be set out in a sub-section of the section you are dealing with, in other sections of the Act. Defnition, for example, can be in Schedules attached to the Act. So it is never enough just to assume that the section or sections you have been referred to are the only sections you need to be aware of. \nYou should initially read the section carefully for clues as to defnitions elsewhere, and \nread the table of contents of the statute to see if there are any sections clearly referring to interpretational matters. This also assists you in gaining a more context-based idea of the statute, which is useful to have when considering your sections. \nThe screenshot in Figure 7 .3 shows you the frst entries in the online arrangement of \nthe Equality Act 2010 from the Westlaw database. As Westlaw contains academic journal articles and cases as well as legislation it is also ideal for locating cases, and academic articles that relate to the section(s) you are dealing with. \nWe will consider the information that is given in the Figure 7 .3 screenshot, which shows \nParts 1 and 2 of the Act; there are more, but these are not on the screenshot. Furthermore we can see that \nPart 2 is divided into chapters, as \nChapter 1 Protected Characteristics is \non screen. Sections 1–5 are on screen. \nYou will note that three box icons containing ‘N’, ‘!’ or ‘V’ are used as annotations in \nfront of Sections 1–5 on the left side of the screenshot. \n  N: indicates sections not yet in force on the date that Westlaw was accessed (this is \nrelevant to ss 1–3).5 \n  !: indicates that an amendment to section 1 is pending. \n  V: indicates that the section was in force on the date of access. \n4 A lthough, as you will see when considering statutory interpretation in this chapter, judges interpreting \nwords and phrases in court will often deal in the substitution of words for those in the statute in an attempt \nto clarify meaning and this can give rise to more problems. \n5 A ccessed 10 December 2019. \n\n--- Page 211 ---\n    \n  \n     180 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nFigure 7.3 Screenshot of arrangement of Equality Act 2010 \n  If you were to scan down the retrieved page you would fnd a further box icon with an \n‘R’ in it indicating that a section has been repealed. \nThe second tab at the top of the screenshot on the far left indicates that this Act was one of 1,244 search results. This is because of the number of statutory instruments that have been published under the Act. \nYou should further note the icon for a pdf in the top right-hand corner of the screen. \nThis takes you to an annotated copy of the print version of the statute published by The Stationery Offce. \nThe Figure 7 .4 screenshot shows you the opened pdf at the table of contents. This is \nthe same as the ‘arrangement of Act’ found online but is in its print version. However, in this online version by Westlaw the same icons are inserted into the pdf by the editors of Westlaw and all areas of the Act are hyperlinked for easy navigation. \nYou will recall that the offcial version of the legislation is found on the government \nwebsite, www.legislation.gov.uk . You should always check this to ensure the information \nretrieved from any other source is correct. \n\n--- Page 212 ---\n     \n     \n  \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 181 \nFigure 7.4 pdf from Westlaw of original print version open at the table of contents \nFigure 7.5 Screenshot of the Equality Act 2010 showing part of the table of contents from www.legislation. \ngov.uk (accessed 10 December 2019) \nFigure 7 .5 shows the frst entries for the ‘table of contents’ from www.legislation.gov \n.uk and which are accessed by the table of contents tab. It is annotated; an automated \nbox is on screen stating that there are outstanding changes to the table of contents not yet made by the editorial team. \nNote that on the left-hand side of the screenshot you have two choices: to view the \nlegislation as originally enacted and the latest revised version. It can be extremely useful \n\n--- Page 213 ---\n    \n     \n  \n 182 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nFigure 7.6 Screenshot of changes to s1 Equality Act from www.legislation.gov.uk (accessed 29 October 2014, \n10 December 2019) \nwhen you are engaged in research to be able to view the original version of the Act. But \nfor ascertaining the current law you need to access the revised version. \nFigure 7 .5 shows that the website indicates that there are changes to s 1 and clicking \non the relevant section you will fnd a box stating there are changes and you are offered the opportunity to ‘view outstanding changes’. Click on the s 1 alert: you will fnd out how s 1 is affected by other legislation. \nThe Figure 7 .6 screenshot gives you the screenshot revealing the changes to s 1 and \neffects yet to be applied. Also note that the tab entitled ‘prospective’ gives the new sec -\ntion wording. \nFrom a quick survey of the table of contents or arrangement of the Equality Act 2010 on \neither of the two databases we have considered, you can get an overview of how the Act is divided as well as what it is concerned with and changes to the Act both made and prospective. \nThis basic information is set out in Figure 7 .7 \nFigure 7 .7 indicates that the Equality Act has 16 parts, 218 sections (many of which are \nfurther divided into sub-sections, paragraphs and sub-paragraphs) and 28 Schedules.\n6 \nEarlier, the importance of checking for defnitions was referred to. A search of the table \nof contents reveals that Part 16 of the Act is headed ‘interpretation’ and contains three sections relating to issues of interpretation: \n6 If you need to remind yourself what sections, parts, chapters and Schedules are please refer to Chapter 1. \n\n--- Page 214 ---\n     \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 183 \nEQUALITY ACT 2010 \nGeneral layout \nPART \nThis Act is divided into 16 Parts SCHEDULE \nThis Act is divided into 28 Schedules \nCHAPTE R \n6 Parts (2, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12) are further sub-\ndivided into chapters \nSECTION S \nThe Act contains 218 sec˜ons.

General interpretation. \n213. References to maternity leave, etc. \n214. Index of defned expressions. \nSection 212 ‘General interpretation’ states in alphabetical order the meaning to be given to certain words and phrases in the Act. \nDefnitions of words and phrases can change between Acts so you need to be sure \nyou are using the correct defnitions. In the absence of any guidance you can check the Interpretation Act 1978, which gives general information on the interpretation of words and phrases in statutes. \n\n--- Page 215 ---\n    \n \n 184 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nA closer look at s 212 would show you that it contains 13 sub-sections, many of which \nare divided into paragraphs and sub-paragraphs and give core information concerning \nwhat key expressions in the Equality Act such as ‘equality clause’ mean. \nSection 212(1)(d) refers to the phrase ‘non-discrimination rule’, stating that it has the \nmeaning given to it in s 61. If you are dealing with a section earlier in the Act that uses the term ‘equality clause’ it is important to check its meaning in the interpretation section. You will not necessarily know what is in the interpretation section of a given Act so you need to read it in any Act to make sure you are aware of defnitions. Do not be someone who only relies on second-hand information from books or lectures: it could be wrong! You can acquire a quick comprehension of the content of the statute by skimming the table of contents for both the body of the Act, the parts and/or sections and for the Schedules. \nIn addition, peppered throughout the Act there are sections that defne terms used in \nthe Act. You should also remember that words and phrases, even those defned in an Act, can be the subject of statutory interpretation. Case law therefore may have settled the meaning of words and that too needs to be searched.\n7 \nThe importance of careful research to ensure that \nthe legislation you have is the latest version \nChapters 1 and 6 should have made clear that it is essential to retrieve up to date infor -\nmation on the legislation. You must check the dates of books, articles, cases and the last \nupdate of any website you are browsing. They may predate the legislation or discuss sec -\ntions that have been repealed or changed. This issue is discussed in detail in Chapter 6 . \nThe importance of understanding the layout of \nindividual sections and links between sections \nA basic skill that must be developed if you are to successfully understand and handle \nstatutes is being able to competently navigate sections with confdence, understanding the standard layout of a section. Section 9 of the Equality Act 2010 will be used to dem -\nonstrate how to begin to understand links between parts of a section. The section will be set out, and initial questions asked leading into a guided exercise based on s 9. \nThere are a number of phrases and words in this section that you may not be familiar \nwith, for example: \n  ‘protected characteristic’; \n  ‘racial group’; \n  ‘ethnicity or national origins’; \n  ‘caste’. \nSome words or phrases you may understand at an everyday level; however, it is possible \nthat they have been given a different legal meaning. Here you might have included ‘racial \n7 D etailed search techniques for cases and legislation can be found in Chapter 6 . \n\n--- Page 216 ---\n     \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 185 \ngroup’, ‘race’. The key skill is being able to fnd out from the text what the aim of the sec -\ntion is, and what meaning, if any, has been given to words in it. \nTable 7 .1 sets out the text of s 9 together with a brief summary of it and each of its sub -\nsections. This is a strategy to try and increase your ability to read statutory language. Ask \nyourself if you would have been able to summarise the relevant text. \nOne method for understanding the links in a section is to reduce it to a simple tree \ndiagram showing which ‘bits’ of the section are linked to other ‘bits’, and which are free -\nstanding. You have to understand the section before you can use it. This visual link will help you to see a section as a diagram enabling a visual link between parts of the section to be seen. \nFigure 7 .8 shows a diagram of the current version of s 9. The two websites we have \nreferred to in this chapter both show that s 9 as originally enacted has been the object of changes, and the revised text is set out in the diagram in blue text. \nThe diagram with text shows the links clearly. However, you can reduce your sche -\nmatic diagram to just links between sub-sections. Here you can see in Figure 7 .9 below \nthat only three sub-sections have paragraphs and that there are no sub-paragraphs. As you can see there are no linking words such as ‘if’, ‘and’, ‘or’ to be particularly careful of. But we now know s 9 has been amended. \nLocating the purpose of the section you are \nconsidering: exploring s 9 of the Equality Act 2010 \nLocating the purpose of legislation you are reading can be a diffcult matter and takes \npatience as well as skills application. You cannot apply law you do not properly under -\nstand. You have spent time considering the structure of s 9 of the Equality Act 2010. To allow yourself to be satisfed that you have a correct view of what the section is aiming to do, it is useful to widen your knowledge at this point and consult the offcial government explanatory notes issued with the legislation followed by a cases search for any cases that have determined the meanings of words or phrases in s 9, or discussed the overall meaning of s 9. \nThe explanatory notes re: s 9 of the Equality Act 2010 \nThese bear no legal authority, but they are evidence of what the sponsor of the Act, invariably the government of the day, was intending. It will give an idea of the effect of the section, highlighting anything that is new. The numbering on the left-hand side of the note refers to paragraph numbers in the explanatory note itself. You will also notice that only the section is referred to, not sub-sections. At the end of these notes it gives examples to further assist you to understand the impact of the section. \nAs you will see the explanatory note gives you important information on the meaning \nof the section and its parts, and also refers to ‘protected characteristic’, a phrase we have not yet considered in terms of its meaning. \n\n--- Page 217 ---\n    \n  \n  \n    \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n 186 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nTABLE 7.1 S 9 EA ANNOTATED \nEquality Act 2010: s 9 Brief summary \n(1) Race includes – \n(a) colour; (b) nationality; (c) Ethnic or national origins.

But at the time of accessing this section only these characteristics were protected. They cover a range of attributes that people may have, and the characteristics listed are protected by the Act. So if a person is discrimi -\nnated against because of their race this would be illegal under the Act as race is a pro -\ntected characteristic. We can also see that s 9 is necessary because it defnes what is meant by the term ‘race’. The term ‘race’ includes colour, nationality and ethnicity. Other sections in the Act defne each of the protected characteristics in the list in s 4. \nThe explanatory notes state that all of the protected characteristics were protected \nby legislation in force when the Equality Act was going through Parliament. However, it is noted that caste, as an aspect of race, was not protected. It is to be included in s 9 as an area that the minister may wish to add. Read s 9(5) again: note it is giving power for the future, and s 9(4) refers to ‘caste’. \n\n--- Page 220 ---\n     \n   \n \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 189 \nUnderstanding the impact of changes to statutes \nIt is important to know if the law you have is current. The original s 9(5) gives the min -\nister the right to add ‘caste’ to the list of protected characteristics, and for any use of s \n9 generally or s 9(5) specifcally you would need to check if this had occurred. It is easy to use the drop-down menu on the offcial government website to look for changes to legislation. In relation to s 9 of the Equality Act if you click on the changes to legislation box and expand it, you will see the changes and effects yet to be applied to the whole Act. \nSection 97 only applies to s 9 of the Equality Act 2010 and gives you a good example \nof the use of non-textual amendment. You are told what words to omit and/or add. Note too that only s 97 ss (2)–(4) amend s 9(5). The rest of the sub-sections in s 97 relate to the exercise of the minister’s powers. \nYou need to compare and contrast before and after the change to determine what has \nchanged and what this means. Table 7 .2 above sets out s 9(5) as revised by s 97 of the \nEnterprise and Regulatory Reform Act. \nThis change has a great impact because it opens up the protection of the Equality \nAct to those covered by the caste system. The addition of one word ‘must’ has changed everything. \nArmed with this information you are in a position to describe the changes and then \nconsider the impact of these changes, although at that point you will need to locate sec -\nondary sources to give you the views of academics and professional lawyers on these changes. \nActivity: questions on Section 9 \nThe following questions on s 9 of the Equality Act 2010 are designed to test the consolida -\ntion of the skills you are learning and to ensure that you have a frm foundation.

The addition of one word ‘must’ has changed everything. The phrase ‘may by order’ is inserted into the beginning of the frst line of paragraph (b) \n(2) The power under section 207(4)(b), Comment: \nin its application to sub-section (5), Sub-sections 5, 6 and 7 relate to the minister being \nincludes power to amend this Act. given the power to respectively \n• review the appropriateness of amendments to s \n9(5) \n• after the expiry of fve years \n• and repeal s 9(5) if deemed appropriate \nSub-sections (8)–(10) relate to the boundaries of the \npower (8), and the fact that the power is exercisable by statutory instrument only (9) laid in draft form before Parliament (10). \nLinking a series of sections due to their interconnections \nAbove, the links between  statutes have been discussed with regard to changes to legisla -\ntion. It is also vital to understand how several sections are linked together within a statute \nto obtain a full picture of what the Act is providing. We will now do a guided exercise. \nGuided exercise \nLocate the Equality Act 2010 online on the www.legislation.gov.uk  website and click on \nthe table of contents tab. Scan down the contents and try and get an overview of \nPart 1, \nChapter 2 of the statute, which has the heading ‘Prohibited conduct’. Make a note of what you think it is concerned with before reading on. \nChapter 2 of the contents outlines the three ways in which the Act is infringed, by dis -\ncriminatory behaviour taken because a person has a protected characteristic and/or by harassing or victimising a person because they have a protected characteristic. \n\n--- Page 222 ---\n     \n  \n    191 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nReading s 13 of the Equality Act 2010 \nThis section deals with direct discrimination, one of the behaviours that is illegal if it is done because of a protected characteristic. Read the section carefully and after you have done so consider the following questions: \n(1) Using your own words describe what behaviour is directly discriminatory. \n(2) Write an explanation of the relationship between s 13(1) and Sub-sections (2)–(6). \n(3) Does s 13 contain within it a defence to direct discrimination or indicate that there is one elsewhere in the statute? \nFrom reading s 13 it can be seen that sub-section (1) defnes direct discrimination in general terms as treating someone less favourably than another because they have a protected characteristic. To know if a person had been discriminated against you would have to check an up to date list of protected characteristics in s 4 along with the spe -\ncifc defnitions of each of those protected characteristics. Remember how the protected characteristic of race in s4 is further defned in s 9, including the giving of examples. \nSection 13 in sub-sections (2)–(6) then sets out specifc details concerning when direct \ndiscrimination applies in slightly differing ways to certain protected characteristics. There is no general defence for direct discrimination. Each sub-section in s 13 makes clear the extent of protection within various protected characteristics. \nSome sub-sections are highly specifc, for example, s 13(6) states that breastfeeding \nis included in the protected characteristic of sex, but, however, when a discrimination claim based on breastfeeding occurs in the workplace this is not included in the defni -\ntion of sex. \nIt is also important to note in terms of linking sections together that s 13(7) states that s \n13 is subject to ss 17(6) and 18(7). This means that s 13 must be read in terms of the provi -\nsions in ss 17(6) and 18(7). Equally clear is the absence of any allowed excuse or defence in relation to a claim for direct discrimination. \nIn order to obtain a full and understandable reading of s 13 it has been necessary to \nrefer to s 4 listing the protected characteristics, and to note that in any given case the sections dealing with the defnition of each protected characteristic contained in other sections (e.g. ‘race’ in section 9) may need to be considered. Furthermore we learn the entire section is subject to ss 17(6) and 18(7). \nReading s 19 of the Equality Act 2010 \nThis section prohibits indirect discrimination. It is set out in a tree diagram below to assist with the identifcation of links between the section and its sub-sections. \nNote that s 19 of the Equality Act 2010 contains smaller linking words (e.g. ‘if’ and \n‘and’), which have been highlighted in bold for your ease of reference. These are impor -\ntant connectors (words that link one set of words to another), such as ‘if’, ‘and’ and ‘or’, \n\n--- Page 223 ---\n    \n \n \n \n \n 192 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nsmall words that can be easily overlooked. But their function is to enable you to see which \nsub-sections and paragraphs or sub-paragraphs are connected and which, if any, are not connected. \nThe connectors between the sections, sub-sections, paragraphs and sub-paragraphs \nreveal the type and function of the connection. For example, if the connector between two sub-sections or paragraphs within that sub-section is ‘or’ the connector is indicating that two things are in the alternative.  ‘Or’ indicates an either/or situation. The connector \n‘and’ indicates that things on both sides of it have to be present. There is a major differ -\nence between saying ‘1 or 2’, and saying ‘1 and 2’. This distinction is important to bear in mind when reading a legal rule in a fxed verbal format. \nBefore reading on, answer the following questions based on your reading of s 19: \nActivity \nConsolidation questions: s 19 EA 2010 \n1 What is ‘indirect discrimination’? \n2 What conditions have to be met before the behaviour identifed as indirect discrimination is \nactionable? \n3 Does s 19 provide for a defence? \nFrom your reading of s 19, particularly its header, you will have noted that it is about \nindirect discrimination. It occurs when a ‘provision, criterion or practice’ relating to all persons in an environment covered by the Act, places a heavier burden on certain people due to their possession of one or more protected characteristics. \nA concrete example would be a business that listed its criteria for promotion: \n‘attendance at evening in-house training’. It is statistically proven that more women than men have childcare responsibilities in the evening, so fewer women are able to attend. Therefore such a rule is potentially indirect discrimination because it affects women more than men. \nSub-section 19(2)(d) allows a limited defence: if A can show that the provision, criterion \nor practice is a ‘proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim’ then it is not indirect discrimination. Everything depends on what a legitimate aim might be. \nThe phrase ‘legitimate aim’ is not defned in the legislation and therefore what it might \nmean will be a question for the judiciary to decide in cases. As precedents on its mean -\ning are decided by the senior courts any precedents will be read into the Act by courts determining whether a defendant has a ‘legitimate aim’. \nConsolidation exercise \nBefore moving on to consider statutory interpretation, the following exercise is designed to test whether you have a basic understanding of using legislation. It is also designed to \n\n--- Page 224 ---\n       \n \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 193 Sec˝on 19\nIndirect discrimina˝on\nFor some students seeing tree diagrams\nse\u0011ng out links between sec\u000bons andsub-sec\u000bons is useful. \nSubsec\u000bon (1)\nA person (A) discriminates againstanother (B) if A applies to B a provision\n,\ndiscriminatory in rela\u000bon to a protectedcharacteris\u000bc of B’s\n.

Judges are called upon to interpret words in many types of legal document. We are only considering legislation and will start by con -\nsidering interpretation from a general perspective. \nThe general idea of interpretation \nIt can be argued that an interpreter creates something new when they engage in inter -\npretation. It could be the case that an interpretation that is triggered by an article, for example, bears no resemblance to the writer’s intention. \nJudicial interpretation \nThe majority of law cases deal with the interpretation of legislation. Senior (unelected) judges effectively have the fnal ‘say’ when they engage in statutory interpretation. This gives them an unprecedented power to determine the meaning of words in legislation enacted by the democratically elected Parliament.\n9 Issues of tremendous importance can \nbe raised when a problem about the meaning of a statutory provision goes before a court. \nImportant questions need to be answered, such as: \n  What does this section provide for? \n  How do these legal rules apply to this factual situation? \n  What is the general social impact of this legislation as a whole? \n  Does this legislation effectively deal with the matters it was intended to deal with? \nJudges must bring an interpretation in court; they cannot say ‘I do not know the mean -\ning of this legislation’ and decline to adjudicate a dispute. Additionally, when judges give their interpretation of legislation in the senior courts they can change the entire meaning of a statutory provision. The power of their authority ensures that their inter -\npretation is the given meaning, until another judge, or the legislature, changes that meaning. \nTHE NEUTRALITY AND OBJECTIVITY OF LAW \nIt is often claimed that the law is objective and neutral. Given the fuidity of law and its vulnerability to a range of external and internal factors, claims that it is neutral and objective can often seem compromised. How plausible is it to maintain the neutrality of \n9 It is also worth noting here that if a given Parliament has a substantial government majority (that is, there \nare a large number of government MPs compared with representatives from other parties) then it is the \ngovernment of the day that gets through the legislation that it wants, which may not be a democratic rep -\nresentation of the will of the majority of the people. \n\n--- Page 227 ---\n    \n \n \n 196 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nEnglish law when considering disputes between litigants as well as the state and the \nindividual? \nA frst question should be ‘What do we mean by the term “neutrality”?’. Academics take \ndifferent positions in relation to this question, depending upon their overall philosophi -\ncal or theoretical positions concerning the development and function of law. Certainly, it cannot be denied that the bulk of modern English law is a political creation of Parliament. This politically constructed law is then interpreted by judges in the court, who continue to mould it as they have done for centuries. Can we ever be certain that judges do not ‘tinker’ with the meanings of words or phrases in legislation to achieve an outcome that represents their partisan view? \nJudges are social actors with their own preferences whom we credit with the attempt \nto act fairly in judgment, despite themselves and their natural inclinations. However, at root a judgment is a subjective text and a student’s or a lawyer’s interpretation of that text is also subjective. Any interpretation should be tested against the text and evaluated to see if it is a plausible reading. \nIf we consider law to be like a feld, we could say that politicians determine the broad \nlandscape whilst judges determine where the gateways in and out of that feld might be. They do this by their chosen defnitions of rules or words, which are then applied to the facts of a particular legal dispute. Their reasoning is powerful as it can narrow or broaden the effect of law. \nThe rules of statutory interpretation \nHow do judges set about deciding the meaning of words? Words can change their mean -\ning over time, and courts will disagree over the meaning of words in differing time periods. \nMeanings, not perceived by those drafting the legislation, may lie latent in the words \nof that legislation. These can then be drawn out in court in a manner potentially defeating the supposed intention of the law, making the rule unft for purpose. Or interpretation may narrow or extend the meaning of the rule. Below, the three rules of statutory interpretation (the literal, the mischief and the golden rules) are discussed as well as the more recent approaches of the purposive rule and the teleological\n10 approach to interpretation. These \nrules are, however, rules of practice not rules of law. Therefore a question to pose to yourself is ‘Do judges really use the rules of statutory interpretation? If so, which rule do they use frst?’ \nJudges rarely, if ever, state that they are applying a certain rule of interpretation. Often, \njudges look to see if there can be a literal meaning to the words used in the disputed statutory rule. However, there is no rule that states that they must use the literal rule frst. Holland and Webb\n11 quite correctly assert that perhaps the better question relates \nto what style of interpretation judges use. Interpretation is more a question of judicial style than the use of interpretational rules. Indeed, should you attempt to use the rules of statutory interpretation as a guide in the interpretation of a statutory word or phrase, the \n10 An approach that looks at the purpose of the law and interprets it accordingly. This can involve looking at \nexternal documentation rather than just staying with the internal dimensions of the statute. \n11 J Holland and J Webb, Learning Legal Rules  (6th edition, Blackstone Press, London, 2006), 257. \n\n--- Page 228 ---\n     \n            \n \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 197 \nuselessness of the rules as an interpretational tool will become immediately apparent. \nHowever, as a justifcatory label they may have a function. As you gain experience in read -\ning judgments you will notice vast differences in judicial styles. Some judgments seem to be based on a blow-by-blow analysis of precedents and earlier usage of words; others seem to be based on tenuous common sense rationales. \nJudicial decisions based on the external  context of the statute should be identifed by \nthe judge. Sometimes this is the result of decision making that appears to be based on issues of public policy (a particularly favoured device in the 1960s and 1970s). Reliance on public policy rationale can be referred to as the ‘grand style’ or the ‘teleological approach’. \nThe meaning of a rule and words used to construct the rule can also turn on the form \nof the statute itself, that is, its internal  context. Judges who rigidly adopt the internal \napproach are often referred to as formalists.  Such judges say that they do not create law; \nthey fnd it. They fnd it by following the pathways of the rules of statutory interpretation by moving within  the statute. \nA closer consideration of the simplest defnitions of the rules of statutory interpretation \nenables the classifcation of the literal rule as the formalist  approach and the mischief rule \nas the teleological approach. The golden rule, of course, allows one to ignore the formal-\nist approach of the literal rule. It is most likely to result in a teleological approach as the judge, through the golden rule, is released from formalism! \nIt is therefore essential to have some appreciation of the approaches that the judges \ntake to the issue of interpretation. Without this appreciation you will struggle to fully understand the shifts in the meaning of legislation that can occur as it goes through the courts. \nMany court cases require senior judges to interpret domestic legislation (as well as \nEuropean legislation and treaties) in order to determine the outcome of the case before them. Also many appeals centre on doubt about the meaning of rules. \nWhen judges engage in statutory interpretation they have to: \n  apply legislative rules to various fact situations; \n  decide the meaning of words and phrases used in the statute (of course words can mean many things, and that meaning can change over time); \n  deal with judicial disagreement over the meaning of words. \nThe senior judiciary have developed a range of rules of interpretation (although they are not rules in a legal sense; they are more like conventions); however, they are strictly fol -\nlowed. These rules are the: \n  literal rule; \n  golden rule; \n  mischief rule. \nThe mischief rule has developed into the purposive rule and more generally into a tele -\nological approach to interpretation infuenced by the approach of European judges \n\n--- Page 229 ---\n    \n \n \n  \n 198 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nworking within a civil law legal system. This last approach is unsurprising as in cases \ndealing with EU law and also the law relating to human rights (which is embedded in the European Convention on Human Rights) judges have in the past been required by English legislation to keep to the decisions of the CJEU and the ECtHR. \nIn addition, over time, presumptions have also been established. These are pre -\nassumptions by the judiciary concerning certain matters. For example that Parliament would not intend to repeal a statute without expressly providing for this in later legislation. \nGeneral rules for approaching the language of statutes, which we call linguistic rules, \nhave also been established and they still tend to be expressed in Latin. Additionally there are identifable aids to interpretation both from within the statute (intrinsic aids) and per -\nmissible aids to interpretation from sources outside the statute (extrinsic aids). \nWe will now look at each of these groups, rules of statutory interpretation, presump -\ntions, linguistic rules and aids to interpretation in turn. \nThe three main rules of statutory interpretation \nThere are three main rules of statutory interpretation, which are set out below in Figure 7.12 . \nThe mischief rule as already noted also developed into the teleological approach and \ninstead of just fnding the mischief that the statute was intended to remedy, the judge looks for the ‘spirit’ of the Act. \nThe literal rule \nEssentially this rule states that words should always be given their ordinary, plain and literal meaning. If the words are clear those words state Parliament’s intention. Judicial decisions going back over a century agree that this rule is important for preserving the intention of Parliament and ensuring that the democratic parliamentary will is imposed by judges in courts. \nOne of the more interesting cases to demonstrate the literal rule is the criminal case \nof Whiteley v Chappell (1868).\n12 Whiteley was charged with impersonating a ‘person enti -\ntled to vote’, as he had pretended to be a dead person using that name when he voted. The defence argument in court was that a dead person could not vote; or more strictly according to the wording of the legislation was not ‘entitled to vote’. Therefore as the defendant had impersonated someone who was not entitled to vote he had not commit -\nted the offence. At the trial the judges agreed with this argument. \nNow, on a literal interpretation of the words of the offence of impersonating a ‘person \nentitled to vote’ this result causes no problems. Yet from the perspective of the law there is no doubt that had Parliament been asked if they had intended the offence to cover the circumstances of the case against Whiteley they would have said ‘Yes’. \nThis case demonstrates the ways in which it is possible for a literal interpretation to \nundermine the intention of Parliament. You may of course think that the legislators in \n12 (1868) LR 4 QB 147. \n\n--- Page 230 ---\n     \n   READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 199 \nMischief/purposive \nrule – look at the \nreason for the \nenactment of the \nlegisla\u000eon and decide \nthe meaning of the \nwords in this contextGolden rule – of \ncourse, some\u000emes \nliteral interpreta\u000eons \nare absurd and this \nrule says that judges \ndo not have to use the \nliteral rule in such \ncircumstances Literal rule – all words \nhave a literal meaning \nwhich is discoverable \nby the judge \nMischief /purposive \nrule – look at the \nreason for the \nenactment of the \nlegisla\u000eon and decide \nthe meaning o f the \nwords in this context do not \nliteral rule in such \ncircumstances \nThe three main rules of \nstatutory interpreta\u000eon \nFigure 7.12 The three main offcial rules of statutory interpretation \nParliament should have been more careful with their use of words in the legislation, to \nensure that it covered all possibilities. Should the judges, in deciding cases to their sat -\nisfaction in court, fll in gaps in legislation or is that the job of the legislator? Which is the correct path for justice and for interpretation? \nDrafting legislation is not a scientifc art and there will always be mistakes when the \ngeneralised words of a section in a statute do not cover all the specifc instances it should cover. In Whiteley , the statute was designed to stop fraudulent voting at elections by \npeople pretending they were someone else. Parliament only wished those entitled to vote to do so. Whiteley was not entitled to vote. But, as the statute did not list the specifc \n\n--- Page 231 ---\n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 200 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nscenario of his case, he was acquitted.13 What do you consider to be the best way out \nof this situation if it arose in court? Keep the facts of Whiteley  in your mind and consider \nwhether it would have been useful to apply the second rule of statutory interpretation to the case: the golden rule. \nYou may think that the decision in Whiteley  was in keeping with the section stat -\ning the offence. As there was no other section covering the situation it is right that Whiteley should have been acquitted. Maybe you take the view that Parliament can always amend the legislation to cover the situation in Whiteley.  But another argument \nis that using the literal rule led to absurdity and it should not have been applied. It is worth remembering that one person’s ‘absurdity’ may be another person’s ‘correct’ interpretation. \nThe golden rule \nThis rule states that the literal rule should be followed except on those occasions when to apply the literal rule would lead to absurd results or go against public policy. We can argue that the decision in Whiteley  led to absurdity, allowing a defendant to be acquitted \non a technicality. \nAnother classic criminal case illustrates the golden rule in operation: R v Sigsworth\n14. \nSigsworth had murdered his mother who had died intestate (that is without making a will). The Administration of Estates Act 1925 provided that in such cases the possessions and lands of the deceased go to the next of kin, who was the son, Sigsworth. The court ruled that in a case such as this it would be absurd to allow the son to proft from her death and refused to allow him to inherit, operating a principle of equity that ‘a person cannot beneft from his own wrong’. \nThe mischief rule \nThink of the Whiteley  case again, as we move on to discuss the last of the three main rules \nof statutory interpretation: the mischief rule. This rule in fact predates the previous two, fnding its source in Heydon’s  case.\n15 \nThe mischief rule states that if conditions of doubt arise in a specifc statute the judge \ncan look to the purpose of the Act and the mischief (the wrong) that it was supposed to remedy or prevent. Indeed the initial rationale for legislation was to correct weaknesses in the existing common law. So if a problem with interpretation arose in the court the judge chose the interpretation that best remedied the weakness in the common law. However, it was also extended to cover later legislation and new legislation dealing with mischiefs. \nIn 1980 Lord Diplock, in the case Jones v Wrotham Park Settled Estates ,\n16 made  clear \nthe usefulness and current status of the mischief rule. In his judgment, he took the oppor -\n13 The Law Commission 21 stated very forcefully that the main problem with the literal rule was that it places \n‘undue emphasis on the literal meaning of the words of a provision’ and this in turn ‘assumes an unattain -\nable perfection in draftsmanship’. \n14 [1953] Ch 89. \n15 (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a. \n16 (1980) AC 74. \n\n--- Page 232 ---\n     \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 201 \ntunity to state that the court should be able to say ‘yes’ to three questions before they can operate the mischief rule. \n(1) Can the court precisely ascertain the mischief the Act was intended to remedy? \n(2) Is it apparent that the Act failed to deal with it? \n(3) Is it possible just to state what additional words read into the Act would rectify the situation? \nWould these questions have been of use in Whiteley v Chappell? The court could have answered ‘Yes’ to Questions (1) and (2) above. And no doubt a few words aptly inserted into the relevant section would have resolved the situation. Why do you think they did not themselves think of applying the mischief rule? \nThe purposive rule \nThe mischief rule has been developed into the ‘purposive approach’, which locates a suitable interpretation that gives effect to the general purpose of the legislation. It is an approach of increasing importance and was recognised by Lord Steyn relatively recently in the House of Lords case of R (Quintavalle) v SS Health.\n17 During the course of his judg -\nment, Steyn stated: \nThe pendulum has swung towards purposive methods of construction. This change … has been accelerated by European ideas … the shift towards purposive interpre -\ntation is not in doubt.18 \nThe case of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) v DHSS\n19 provides a good illustration of \nthe use of the purposive rule. The issue in the case concerned the correct interpretation of the phrase ‘registered medical professional’, a phrase used in a number of statutes. The Royal College of Nursing required a defnitive answer due to its use in abortion legis -\nlation. There were conficting interpretations. Does the phrase ‘registered medical profes -\nsional’ just refer to doctors or could it apply to nurses? \nThe RCN took the Department of Health and Social Security to court over the issue. \nThe court held by a three to two majority that abortions by nurses alone were lawful as the purpose of the Act was to stop back street abortions by medically unqualifed persons,\n20 \nand therefore for the purposes of the Abortion Act 1967 as amended a nurse was a ‘reg -\nistered medical professional’. \nThe teleological approach \nOne can also refer to a fourth possible rule, described as the teleological approach. This asks for a further leap in interpretation from the narrower constraints of locating the mis -\nchief the Act is designed to remedy, or locating its purpose, to looking at the spirit  of the \n17 [2003] 2 AC 687. \n18 In para 21. \n19 The Royal College of Nursing v DHSS [1981] 1 All ER 545. \n20 Ibid. \n\n--- Page 233 ---\n    \n \n \n \n 202 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nAct. It is also used in domestic courts when dealing with claims under the Human Rights \nAct, which require the court to take into account cases in the ECtHR. \nOther aids to statutory interpretation Presumptions \nPresumptions represent the accepted judicial view of the way in which manifestations of particular circumstances will be treated and understood, at least until tangible evidence to the contrary is produced. They tend to arise from theoretical and practical principles of the law. Examples of presumptions are: \n  legislation does not intend to change the common law unless this is clearly expressed; \n  legislation does not have retrospective effect (it cannot make unlawful law -\nful behaviour that occurred prior to the legislation being enacted) unless clearly \nexpressed; \n  Parliament does not intend to bind the Crown by law if this is not clearly expressed; \n  legislation does not intend to prohibit judicial review unless this is clearly expressed. \nLinguistic rules \nLinguistic rules apply to the way in which judges will approach the language of legislation in certain circumstances. These rules are known by their Latin tags, for example: \nejusdem generis (the same type); \nIf general words follow on from a list of specifed things the general words only apply to \nthings of the same nature on the list. A word therefore cannot be dealt with in isolation. \nnoscitur a sociis: A word is known by the company it keeps. expressio unius est exclusio alterius: to state one thing is to exclude another. ignorantia leges non excusat: ignorance of the law is no excuse. \nIntrinsic aids to interpretation \nIntrinsic aids to interpretation are the signposts within a particular piece of legislation to \nassist the reader to make sense of it (often referred to as aids that are ‘within the four corners of the legislation’). Taken to its logical conclusion this suggests that the whole of the statute needs to be referred to for meaning. \nIf you think back to the layout of statutes shown at the beginning of this chapter \ndirected to short and long titles, marginal notes, headers, the preamble and of course punctuation. Additionally any examples in the statute are considered to be intrinsic aids to interpretation. \nAll of these devices are not part of the actual law contained in the statute, but they \npoint to divisions of the statute and its words, and to issues of formatting. They are, as such, aids to interpretation. You will also see that Schedules are referred to as well as parts. Not all statutes have these, but when they are present there may be a sepa -\nrate interpretation section, or such a section may be included in the main body of the \n\n--- Page 234 ---\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 203 \nstatute. All of these devices should be included. Schedules are part of the statute and are extremely important in determining the meaning of words or phrases. \nExtrinsic aids to interpretation \nExtrinsic aids to interpretation are the signposts outside  a particular piece of legisla -\ntion that assist the judge to make sense of it. These are of several types. There is a generic interpretation statute, the Interpretation Act 1978 that gives a defnition of words commonly found in statutes. For example, it states in s 6 that words referring to the masculine gender include the feminine (and vice versa). But be warned: any statute can give a different interpretation to these words. Additional extrinsic aids are described below. \nReference to earlier statutes using the same word \nCourts are able to look at the use of some words in earlier statutes for guidance on the meaning of a word, as long as it is clear that the use of the word is about the same matter. The Latin term in pari materia  is used to denote this action. \nDictionaries \nIf a word has no recognisable legal meaning the court is permitted to consult a dic -\ntionary.21 However, since words can change their meaning over time, different editions \nof dictionaries may include different defnitions. Obvious words whose meanings have changed would include, for example, ‘gay’. Each dictionary could also give a different perspective on a word. Which is the ‘right’ one? \nTravaux préparatoires \nIn many European legal systems working from variants of Roman law within civil code systems, courts are able to study public materials produced during the course of the journey from a draft to fnalised legislation. These documents are referred to as prepara -\ntory works or travaux préparatoires. \nHansard \nTraditionally UK judges were not permitted to look at documents produced before the Act was drafted (e.g. government reports, recommendations or other policy documents), or at any proceedings in Parliament as the bill was going through its journey to becoming an Act. These latter documents are recorded verbatim by Hansard. The underlying ration -\nale for not allowing access to this material is the fact that Article [IX] of the Bill of Rights 1689\n22 allows MPs to say what they wish within Parliament, stipulating that ‘Parliament \nought not to be... questioned in any court of law or place outside Parliament’. This had \n21 We have in other chapters referred to the case of Mandla v Dowell Lee [1983] 2 AC 803 which concerned \nascertaining the meaning of the word ‘ethnic’, and the case is a good demonstration of the problems of \nusing dictionaries to fnd the meaning of the word. See judgment of Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal. \n22 1688 c. 2 (Regnal. 1 Will & Mar Sess 2). \n\n--- Page 235 ---\n    \n \n           \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 204 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nbeen widely interpreted to mean that it was not even permissible to look at Hansard, the \nverbatim record of the debates and committees in Parliament. \nHowever, a change was signalled in the case of Pepper v Hart .23 The judges in the \nHouse of Lords were of the opinion that Hansard could be referred to if: \n  the legislation that is the object of the statutory interpretation is ambiguous, obscure \nor leads to absurdity; \n  the document relied on relates to statements by the minister or promoter of the legis -\nlation, together with any other parliamentary documents as necessary to understand such statements; \n  the statements relied upon are clear. \nThe House said that this should only happen in rare cases, not as a matter of course. Six judges were in agreement with this course of action, but one, Lord Mackay, dis -\nsented. He argued that the practicalities involved would be tremendously expensive. Lord Bridge considered that the court would not use its power very much, although he was ini -\ntially proved wrong (concurrent with the greater use of this freedom, drawbacks became apparent). Exactly how much ambiguity suffces to open Hansard, and how clear must the minister’s statement be? \nBy 1996 the House of Lords was voicing concern about the freedom given by Pepper \nv Hart.\n24 Lord Steyn25 has even severely criticised Pepper v Hart in non-judicial situations \nsuch as after-dinner speeches or public lectures. The main issue is that, of course, any word in a statute can in certain contexts be thought ambiguous. Opening up Hansard for discussion and determination by the judges raised the possibility that understanding concerning the meaning of words and phrases could be completely overturned. \nIn 1995 a practice direction had been issued relating to the usage of Hansard material \nfor the purposes of statutory interpretation.\n26 This was repeated in a later consolidating \npractice statement in 1999 covering the Court of Appeal (Civil Division)27 and then later \nthe criminal courts.28 Now if a party to a case wishes to rely on Hansard, they must serve \ncopies of the extract and a short précis of their argument on the other party or parties at least fve working days before the hearing. \nSo, the decision in Pepper v Hart has had a mixed reception from the judiciary, and \njudges speaking extra-judicially have been highly critical of it.\n29 Doubtless it marks an \nimportant paradigm shift with regard to judicial interpretation. \nExplanatory notes \nThe department of state sponsoring bills now issues explanatory notes in important areas of law to guide the reader. They do not form part of the statute, are not authorised and \n23 [1993] 1 All ER 42 (HL). \n24 Brown Wilkinson LJ was one of the majority judges in Pepper v Hart , but in Melliush (Inspector of Taxes) v \nBMI (No 3) [1996] AC 454 he said that the ministerial statement had to be directed to the very point that is \nthe subject of doubt in the current case. \n25 J Steyn ‘ Pepper v Hart  A Re-examination’ (2001) 21 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 59. \n26 Practice Direction (Reference to Extracts from Hansard) [1995] 1 WLR 192; 20 December 1994. \n27 [1999] 1 WLR 1059. \n28 [2002] 1 WLR 2870. \n29 K Llewellyn The Common Law Tradition  (Little Brown, Boston MA, 1960). \n\n--- Page 236 ---\n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 205 \nhave no legal effect. But such notes do have their uses, particularly as an aid to under -\nstanding the aim and intent of the drafter of the legislation. Those aims and intentions, however, can of course change during the act of interpretation in court. If you read the explanatory notes of legislation, you need to be aware that case law may have changed the interpretation laid upon a certain section, etc., by the explanatory notes. \nInterpretation Act 1978 \nThis Act sets out a range of issues relating to interpretation. The Act provides general meanings for words (e.g. that the masculine always includes the feminine and vice versa unless it is specifcally stated that this is not to be the case). \nWhich rules of interpretation should be used, when, and in what order? The rules of \ninterpretation that have been so far identifed are not, themselves, legal rules but guid-ance rules. And you will not be surprised to learn that no legal rules exist that state which rules of interpretation can be used, nor their order of use. What we should consider, however, is how judges choose the appropriate rules of interpretation applicable to the job at hand, and how they explain that choice. Some might say judges merely want to be seen to have a method so that they are not accused of just creating law, but you would be better off thinking of statutory interpretation as allowing the use of a range of styles of interpretation. Everyone is different, and individual judges prefer and use different styles of interpretation. \nNearly 50 years ago, long before the development of cases such as Pepper v Hart , Karl \nLlewellyn\n30 noted that judges in fact have two styles of interpretation: the grand style and \nthe formal style. The formal style is quite rigid in its deference to tradition, doctrine and the view that judges should not and do not create law. The grand style is used by judges who are more creative and fexible in their use of interpretation.\n31 \nStatutory interpretation and the European \nConvention on Human Rights \nThe Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA 1998) gives claimants the right to go to a domestic \ncourt to bring an action for infringement of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This requires the judiciary to interpret the Convention. \nThe HRA 1998 states that in doing so they must recognise the decisions of the European \nCourt of Human Rights. Section 2 of the HRA imposes a statutory duty on courts; they must take account of decisions of the ECtHR and the Committee of Ministers. \nSection 3 imposes a positive statutory duty on courts when interpreting primary and \nsecondary domestic legislation to do so in a manner that is compatible with ‘convention rights’ set out in Schedule 1. \nThe requirement for courts to take into account the case law of the ECtHR has exerted \nan impact on the way that English judges interpret both legislation and case law. The \n30 An excellent case study of Llewellyn’s observation can be found in the case of Davis v Johnson  [1978] 1 \nAll ER 841 (CA) affd [1978] 1 All ER 1132 (HL). It is also the subject of an excellent case study by Twining \nand Miers How to Do Things with Rules (2013). An informative and interesting summary of this area is also contained in Holland and Webb Learning Legal Rules (6th edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2006). \n31 Is this not another description of the teleological approach? \n\n--- Page 237 ---\n    \n \n \n \n 206 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nEnglish judiciary have had to make changes to their standard methods of interpretation of \nstatutes.32 In those areas where the courts have a duty to consider the case law from the \nEuropean courts they confront a major difference. In English court cases it is customary for dissenting judgments to be published. These are judgments expressing a particular judge’s disagreement with the majority decision of the court. Even where several judges agree on outcome they can disagree on the detailed route they took to their agreement. Each judge can choose to issue a judgment; therefore, in English courts judges are used to dealing with several judgments in previous decided cases that they may be consider -\ning. However, it is customary for the ECtHR to give one decision and the reasons given for their decision are usually less detailed than in English courts, although at times a dis -\nsenting judgment may be published.\n33 \nThis does not mean that English courts do not give reasons in cases dealing with the \nECtHR, but the cases it receives at the European level have to be incorporated into their decisions and these cases come from a different legal tradition where the detailed ration -\nale for the decision is not expected or required.\n34 Although it is accepted that these cases \ndo in fact lay down frm guidelines that need to be followed. \nStatutory interpretation and secondary legislation \nIt is not just primary legislation that calls for statutory interpretation. There are thousands of pages of secondary legislation published each year, and these too can become central to legal disputes prompting a need for interpretation. More or less the same rules apply as those that we have already briefy noted, but with secondary legislation there are also extra tasks and issues that require consideration. \nSecondary legislation has to be read in conjunction with the parent Act. The \nInterpretation Act 1978 states in s 11 that words used in the secondary legislation must be interpreted to have the same meaning as words used in the parent Act. But, if the parent Act itself is vague, the court will probably have to consider the meaning of both. \nWhilst primary legislation has hierarchical standing over common law, secondary leg -\nislation does not. The courts, therefore, will not wish to apply an interpretation that dis -\nlodges established common law. Whilst courts cannot declare a primary Act invalid, they can declare secondary legislation invalid if the powers delegated have been overstepped. \nSummary to statutory interpretation \nThis brief discussion reveals the different approaches to statutory interpretation that can occur as one case travels through the judicial system. It is worth noting that the rules of statutory interpretation that a judge is applying are not generally referred to in the course of the judgment. Context and judicial attitudes or preferences determine the rules used. \n32 See further Chapter 12 . \n33 This was done in the case of Al-Skeiniand others v United Kingdom  (Application no. 55721/07; Reported: \n(2011) 53 EHRR 18; 30 BHRC 561; [2011] Inquest LR 73; Times , 13 July 2011. \n34 That is, deciding current cases on the same basis as previous similar cases in the Court of Appeal or \nSupreme Court depending on where the case is currently being heard – there is more discussion on these \nmatters in the chapters covering case law. \n\n--- Page 238 ---\n     \n   READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 207 \nOnly careful analysis of the judgment will indicate the ‘styles’ of interpretation that seem \nto be represented. \nInterpretational problems can never be solved by the neat application of interpretational \nrules. Even worse, perhaps, the rules do little or nothing to solve problems. Perhaps all they do is justify solutions. There is rarely one right answer, only a range of more plausible and less plausible outcomes, varying according to interpretational styles. Judges use their creativity in working out a solution according to criteria that must be rational either in real-ity or in argument. They invariably go beyond the text when constructing answers. Lord Denning, for example, moved from dictionary defnitions to subjective assertion. Often, judges say no more than ‘this is the answer because I say so’. \nJudges, as previously noted, can be classifed as formalists or contextualists. Knowing \nthis it may sometimes be possible to guess which rules the judges are using, though sometimes you may not understand what they are arguing. At times, judges themselves are wrong and not too sure themselves of the appropriate outcome. This is what makes comprehension of the methods of statutory interpretation, and the use of precedents, so diffcult. It is essential to realise the limits of a supposed scientifc approach and the limitless possibilities that open up when the illogical bridges from one set of rationales to the next are located. \nAs judges have engaged more with the European dimensions of interpretation they \nengaged more often with the teleological approach used in European cases. As dis -\ncussed in Chapter 4 , the Human Rights Act 1998 states that judges deciding cases on \nthe enforcement of European Convention rights must  have regard to the case law and \njurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. \nCONCLUSION \nThe majority of English law is in the form of legislation. Understanding statutory provi -\nsions context is a core skill for the competent critical evaluation of the rationale for a par -\nticular statute. It is also core for the competent legal analysis and application of statutory provisions when engaging in legal problem-solving. \nBeing able to understand the layout of statutes, and of sections within them, as well \nas appreciating the links between sections in a statute, and between several statutes, ensures that you are in a good position to begin the task of understanding the detail of any legislation you are dealing with. \nCompetent analysis of legislation also involves the equally important skill of reading \ncase law. It is essential to also be aware of any leading cases determining the meaning of words and phrases in the legislation you are considering, and understand the process of statutory interpretation. \nWhilst many databases can assist you with fnding a statute and then searching within, \nit is essential to appreciate that there is only one offcial source of legislation, the govern-ment’s online database, www.legislation.gov.uk, which is hosted by the National Archives. \n\n--- Page 239 ---\n    \n   \n   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  208 READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  A range of skills need to be used to understand legislation: language skills, substan -\ntive knowledge skills, argumentative skills and rule handling skills. \n  Correct understanding of the relationship between parts, chapters, sections, sub -\nsections, paragraphs, sub-paragraphs, marginal notes, headings and Schedules \nenables the general layout of the Act to be ascertained. \n  Always use up to date, reliable academic or professional sources to ascertain whether legislation is current. \n  The only offcial source of information on statutes and changes to them is the govern -\nment’s online database at  www.legislation.gov.uk. \n  When statutes do not defne the meaning of words in them and a legal dispute is before the courts the judiciary engage in statutory interpretation. \n  There are three conventional ‘rules’ of statutory interpretation developed by the judi -\nciary: the literal, golden and mischief rules. \n  The mischief rule has given rise to the purposive rule and the teleological approach. \n  Judges also use presumptions, linguistic rules and intrinsic and extrinsic aids to interpretation. \n  When secondary legislation is the object of statutory interpretation it must be read in conjunction with the parent Act. \nCONSOLIDATION TO EXERCISE (COMPARISON BETWEEN S 9 OF THE \nEQUALITY ACT 2010 AND S 3 OF THE RACE RELATIONS ACT 1976) \n(1) What general language differences occur between the two sections? \nThe language in s 3 of the RRA 1976 retains the old format of ‘he’ meaning \n‘she’ in general terms. Provision for this is made under the Interpretation Act 1978. \nSection 6 provides: \nIn any Act, unless the contrary intention appears, \n(a) words importing the masculine gender include the feminine; \n(b) words importing the feminine gender include the masculine; \n(c) words in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular. \nHowever, s 9 moves away from masculine and feminine and adopts the more neutral words ‘person’ and ‘persons’ instead. \n(2) Which section is the easier, if any, to understand? \nI would suggest that s 9 of the EA 2010 is easier in terms of using a much more \nstraightforward layout. It is more logically set out, particularly in terms of distinguish -\ning between race and racial grounds. \n\n--- Page 240 ---\n     \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING LEGISLATION 209 \n(3) What major differences are there between the two sections? \nSection 9 of the EA 2010 introduces the concept of ‘caste’ into the defnition of \nrace, and racial grounds. \nSection 9 does not include the reference to the comparison set out in s 3(4) of the Race \nRelations Act 1976. In fact this is found in s 23 of the EA 2010 and is now applied gen -\nerally (unless expressly excluded in relation to any protected characteristic). This was ascertained by looking down the sections in \nPart 2 of \nChapter 2 and noting one was sub-\nheaded ‘comparison by reference to circumstances’. \n\n--- Page 242 ---\n8 \n  \n READING AND \nUNDERSTANDING CASES \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Understand the rationale and theory behind the doctrine of precedent. \n  Explain the doctrine of precedent. \n  Appreciate the difference between theoretical and practical considerations of \nprecedent. \n  Competently read a case and prepare a case note. \n  Identify the constituent parts of the ratio  of a case. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-10  \n\n--- Page 243 ---\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   212 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nINTRODUCTION \nAn understanding of the doctrine of precedent is essential for the successful study of law. \nIn this chapter we will briefy consider the theory of precedent before focusing on practi -\ncal advice for reading a judgment by a judge or judges determining cases in a court of law. This chapter will also explain how to read both individual and related cases and look for the links between them. Finally, strategies will be suggested to help you break down the language and argument of a judgment. \nLEGAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN COURT \nThe few legal disputes that cannot be resolved by negotiation or another alternative dis -\npute resolution (ADR) process (some of which are considered in \nPart 4 of this book) are \ndetermined by judges in the trial courts and, in an even smaller number of cases, by the senior judiciary in the appellate courts. The word ‘few’ must be stressed here: only about 4 per cent of all formally commenced disputes reach a hearing in court and many of these settle at the doors of the courtroom. \nT\nhe decisions of judges are delivered orally in court when the judge may read a pre-writ -\nten judgment or speak from notes. These words spoken and recorded constitute the text that contains any legally binding rules. At the time of delivery, the judge’s words are usually recorded verbatim by the court stenographer. In addition, law reporters, employed by pub -\nlishers, may be in court taking shorthand notes. The record of all judgments will be kept by the court. But some decisions, thought to be important to the development or understand -\ning of the law, will also be published commercially as a ‘law report’. Each publisher will structure their reports differently, perhaps adding footnotes or summaries, but the words attributed to the judge have to remain a true and accurate record of those spoken. \nUsually, judges in the civil courts and the appellate courts (both criminal and civil) will \nrefect upon the case before reaching a fnal decision – holding back, or reserving, judg -\nment until a later date. In criminal cases the judge may sentence immediately after the jury has reached a verdict in the trial court, or call for reports and sentence at a later date. What judges say in their judgments is of immense importance, not only for the litigants but for the development of the law. \nThe phrase ‘common law’ has different meanings according to the context in which \nit is used. One of its meanings relates to the legal rules developed by senior judges when deciding cases in the appeal courts (the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court). Common law, when used in this sense, relates to legal rules that are not created by the authorisation of Parliament but through the acts of the most senior judges in the English legal system.\n1 \n1 T here has been, and continues to be, much argument among legal philosophers as to whether judges \nactually make  or create  law ‘out of nothing’ through their reasoning, or merely declare  what the law has \nalways been. Many judges state that they do not make the law, they discover it and thus declare what it \nhas always been. This latter viewpoint is referred to as the declaratory theory  of law making. \n\n--- Page 244 ---\n     \n \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 213 \nINTRODUCING PRECEDENT \nIn the English legal system if a judge knows that the case before the court is similar to an \nearlier decided case then the current case must be decided in keeping with the reason -\ning process used in that previous case. There are certain criteria that must be followed in determining not only whether the current case is similar to a previous case, but whether the court is bound, which depends on the court’s position in the hierarchy of courts.\n2 This \nprocess is known as the ‘doctrine of precedent’. The doctrine is referred to by the use of a Latin phrase: \nStare decisis et non quieta movere: ‘to stand by decisions and not disturb the undisturbed’. \nIn practice this phrase is shortened to: \nStare decisis:  ‘to let the decision stand’. \nThe practice of precedent is not a legally imposed requirement but one that has been developed as a matter of custom and practice in the higher courts since the nineteenth century. Although most legal systems have some notion of previous decisions being taken into account when new cases are decided, in the English legal system it is a prac -\ntice enforced by the senior judiciary with an unparalleled rigour which makes the English legal system unique among all  others. \nA key part of a lawyer’s job is to research previous cases to help predict the outcome \nof the current case – after all, there is no point in going to court if the exact point the client wishes to make has already come before a court and been determined to his detriment. The doctrine of precedent as it stands is therefore a useful tool, although the possibility of a different interpretation being placed, for example, on the meanings of words that were previously thought to be settled can never be ruled out. \nPersuasive precedents \nIn addition to those precedents that are binding there are also a group of precedents that are persuasive only. That means that they are of suffcient standing to be taken seriously but are not binding because they are from another common law legal system, or from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. For example, the case of Attorney General of Jersey v Holley\n3 was a Privy Council case. However, it had a bench of seven judges, all of \nwhom were also senior judges in the House of Lords at that time. Because of this the case dealt with identical law to the English, but took a different approach and clarifed doubts. That case was subsequently referred to in the English senior courts and precedents were set using it as a persuasive precedent. \n2 S ee Chapter 2 for a discussion of the hierarchy of courts. \n3 [2005] UKPC 23; [2005] 2 AC 580 (PC) \n\n--- Page 245 ---\n    \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n  214 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nCROWN \nCOURT Superior \nCour t \nCriminal \nTrial cour t SUPREME COUR TOF THE UNITED KINGDO M \nSuperior Court: Appellate Court (civ il and criminal) \nFinal UK Court of Appeal for England, Wales and Northern Ir elan d \n[Note: Prior to 20 09 HOUSE OF LORDS] \nCOURT OF APPEAL \nSuperior Court: Appellate cour t \nCriminal Division Civil Division \nHIGH COUR T \nSuperior Court: Predominantly a Civi lTrial cour t \n[Exercises a limited criminal jurisdic˜o n, and li mited appeal func˜o n] \nFAMILY DIVISION CHANCERY DIVISION \nMAGISTRATES’ COURTS \nInferior cour t \nExercises administra˜v e and trial court func˜ons QUEEN’S BENCH DIVISION \nFigure 8.1 UK court structure: with arrows showing hierarchical relationships \nRelationship between legislation and precedent \nIf the law created by the authority of Parliament (legislation) is in confict with a common law \nprinciple developed by judges, it will always overrule common law.4 Judges therefore must \nimplement statutory law even if it is in confict with existing applicable common law rules. \nRequirements for an effective system of precedent \nThe doctrine of precedent requires: \n  An effective system of law reporting and/or an effective system of accessing court \ntranscripts of judgments. \n  A clear hierarchical court structure. \n  Clear rules of practice setting out the duties of and responsibilities of judges in each court with regard to the doctrine of precedent. \nHierarchy of the courts \nThe hierarchy makes clear which courts can overrule the decisions of other courts in appeals\n5 and is fundamental to an understanding of when a given court is bound by a \nprevious case. \n4 S ee Chapter 1 on the sovereignty of Parliament. \n5 S ee Chapter 2 \n\n--- Page 246 ---\n     \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 215 \nGenerally a court is bound by precedents of those courts that are above it in the \nhierarchy, and by precedents previously established in the same court, though there are \nsome exceptions. Each court is responsible for drawing up its own practices. Changes are made by ‘practice statements’, which are published in the law reports. \nUnderstanding the theory of the doctrine of precedent \nMany legal theorists and practitioners have attempted, over the years, to give precise defnitions of the English doctrine of precedent. No one is completely right or wrong and the defnitions vary. However, a few theoretical ground rules can be established, which at least place the operation of the doctrine of precedent within a context we have already discussed. For instance: \n  judges at all levels of the court hierarchy must follow  similar decisions of the higher \ncourts; \n  judges in the Supreme Court have the freedom to decline to follow their own previous \ndecisions. \nFrom a theoretical as well as a practical point of view, this strict adherence to precedent brings the following benefts to the legal system: \n  certainty of the law; \n  curbs arbitrary decisions; \n  maintenance of equality; \n  provides a rational base for decision making. \nSome argue that the doctrine also brings disadvantages. It can:   make the law infexible; \n  force legal change to be slow and convoluted; \n  encourage tedious hair-splitting tendencies in legal argument. \nKey to the operation of the doctrine is the meaning of ‘similar’, which we will now consider \nin light of differing academic views. \nWhat does ‘similar’ mean? \nHow similar must a previous case be before it becomes a precedent? The facts of cases usually vary in some way and the doctrine does not specify that the case must be identi -\ncal. Sometimes, legal representatives will strenuously argue that previous cases are not precedents because they can be distinguished on their facts. In other words, they are not similar. \n\n--- Page 247 ---\n216 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nQ: Must the law in the \nbinding case be similar to \nthe law now? are small di˜erences in \nthe facts of each case?

The same \nmaterial facts, the legal rule although \nbinding case will possibly perhaps in another place \nbe applicabl e may cons°tute 'similar' \nFigure 8.2 Q & As on similarities \nThere is no single defnition of the word, ‘similar’, and this is where the judge can bring \nsubjective infuences into the decision making processes. He or she can determine what \n‘similarity’ is in the current case weighed against the precedent; in this way, extremely subtle ‘differences’ can be found between two cases. \nLaw is about life and life rarely replicates itself exactly, but trends and degrees of simi -\nlarity can be noted. Figure 8 .2 sets out some questions that are important to the issue of \nsimilarity: \nDealing with the slippery issues of similarity is a diffcult and interpretative exercise. \nBut once you are able to determine that a previous case is similar, then the next one must consider ‘how can the reasoning in the case be extracted?’ \nFinding, understanding and using the reasoning in a case \nCases defned as similar must also be decided in accordance with the same reasoning process, since the actual doctrine of precedent refers to adherence to the reasons  for \ndeciding past cases. But how does one fnd that reasoning? \nWambaugh,\n6 a late nineteenth-century American theorist, suggests that one way of \nascertaining the reason for the decision (the ratio decidendi ) is to look for a general rule \nof law in the judgments and test whether it is foundational for deciding the case by trans -\nlating it into the negative form. You can then see if the case would have been decided differently. This negative method of fnding the ratio  or rule is illustrated in Figure 8 .3. \nAnother respected legal theorist, Goodhart, wrote an infuential article that refers far \nmore to the principle  in the case than the ratio.\n7Goodhart emphasises the consideration \nof facts: \n  What are the material facts, as found by the judge? \n  What is the judge’s decision? \n  Unless there is a new material fact (or there are some missing material facts) a future \ncourt, depending upon its place in the court hierarchy, and thus its obligations under the doctrine of precedent, must follow it. \n6 E Wambough, ‘The study of cases 1894’ cited in R Cross and JW Harris Precedent in English Law \n(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1991), 52–3. \n7 A Goodhart, ‘Determining the ratio decidendi of a case’ 22 MLR  117. \n\n--- Page 248 ---\n     \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 217 \nExtract a propos i\u0014on  of law \nChange  its formu la\u0014on to the nega\u0014ve \nApply the nega\u0014ve form ula\u0014on to \nthe case \nIf the outcome  is the same, the \niden\u0014fed  proposi\u0014on of \nlaw is NOT the ra˛o of the \ncase \nIf the  outcome is the same, the iden\u0014fed \nproposi\u0014on  of law IS the ra˛o of the \ncase \nProblem: thi s method is designed to work only with one proposi\u0014on of law \nThere can be more than one proposi\u0014on in a case. \nFigure 8.3 Wambaugh’s method for location of the precedent \nA major problem with Goodhart’s suggested method is his emphasis upon the facts. \nAlthough it can be said that reading a judgment in the light of the facts of the case is a core requirement of the doctrine, attention also needs to be given to the way that the case is: \n  argued; \n  pleaded (exactly how have the lawyers formally lodged the complaint?); \n  reasoned. \nin relation to other precedents. \nWambaugh, Cross and Goodhart’s methods are summarised in Figure 8 .4. \nEven when considered together, there are still problems. In particular: \n  What should an interpreter do when there is a decision without reasons? Can the \nratio be inferred? \n  What can be done with the diversity of forms of judgments? \n\n--- Page 249 ---\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n  218 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nFinding the \nra˛o \n(principle) \nof a case It is not found in \nthe rule of law \nset out in the \nopinio n \nA case can have \nmore than one \nra˛o \nA judge can \nexpressly (directly) \nor im pliedly \n(indirectly) treat \ncertain facts as \nmaterial or \nimmaterial \nWhat  are immaterial \nfacts?

Each \ncan give judgment, although often a judge will simply concur. Often in an appeal case there will be a clear majority in agreement with regard to both the outcome of the case and its supportive reasoning. A majority judgment by the senior judiciary in agreement \n\n--- Page 250 ---\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 219 \non outcome and reasoning creates a strong precedent as it represents the ratio of the majority of the court. \nAt times there may be one or more minority judgments. In such cases, there will be \nagreement with the majority view that a particular party should win the case – that is they agree on the outcome. However, there may be disagreement with the majority view of the legal reasoning process leading to that decision. Each of these minority judgments represents a reasoned judgment with a ratio.  Unless all of those in the minority agree with \neach other, it is possible to have several different ratios. If several respected senior judges \nagree in their minority judgment, then it is possible to argue in certain circumstances in a later case that the precedent of the majority should be overridden in favour of the minor -\nity view. \nThe implementation of the doctrine of precedent is diffcult in those cases where there \nis no clear preferred ratio.  But what if the different judges in a case agree on the outcome \nand disagree on the reasons for that outcome? \nJudges may also dissent on the outcome but either agree or disagree with the majority \nratio.  Dissenting judgments do not form precedents. But it is possible with the passage of \ntime that the dissenting view comes to be considered the prevailing view and later courts may be able to privilege that dissenting judgment. \nA lack of agreement among judges about the reasoning process can weaken the prec -\nedent value of the case. \nConsider, for example, these two different scenarios: \n  The majority of judges agree to dismiss/allow the appeal on one ground. A minor -\nity of judges agree with the majority as to the outcome, but base their decision on a different ground. In this situation, the ratio  of the majority is binding and strong. \nThe ratio of the minority may become the object of weighty consideration in a future \ncase. \n  The majority agree to dismiss/allow the appeal, but there is no common ground as to why the appeal has been dismissed or allowed. In this situation, there is no clear majority in favour of any ratio. The case, therefore, lacks authority for the narrowest interpretation of the ratio. It is impossible to state clearly how such a case is viewed \nother than to treat it as a weak authority. \nIt is diffcult, if not impossible, to come up with a clear formula that will always work for ascertaining the ratio  of a case. Law is organic, about life, not mechanics. But a \nreasonable idea of the diffculties in ascertaining the ratio  is a necessary and revealing \nstep for any interpreter. Ignoring these diffculties will ultimately lead to simplistic and inadequate construction of legal arguments. If an argument is being made on weak, tenuous or stretched grounds, it is better to know that it is. Deciding whether a case is a precedent involves consulting a wide range of sources and using a broad range of skills.

Counsel for the respondent argues that \nit is not binding on you. Both have also referred you to cases B and C. As part of your legal studies, you will be expected to read cases both in isolation and as a series of cases which (over the course of years) develop a principle of law or which demonstrate how a principle of law has been retained or changed. \nImagine that you are sitting as a judge in the Court of Appeal civil division and you are \ndealing with an appeal court case, Case E. Counsel for both parties have to have followed Case A. Cases in the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. \nYou will need to ascertain from an objective, neutral perspective which, if any, of these \ncases are binding on you. As you will know from your understanding of the court hierar -\nchy, that the Court of Appeal binds and is bound by the Supreme Court. \nYou should then look at the facts of the cases and the legal rules applicable as well \nas the grounds of appeal in each case to determine at a basic level whether the case is similar and therefore potentially binding on you. \nYour method might look like this: \n  Ascertain the material facts of Case A and consider whether they are similar to the facts in Case E. \n  Ascertain the legal rules applicable in Case A and consider whether they are similar to the legal rules to be applied in Case E. \n  If you are dealing with similar facts and legal rules the Case could well be binding. \n  Ascertain the ratio (or ratios)  applicable in Case A and consider whether you agree \nwith the formulation as given by counsel. They may have given conficting formula -\ntions and you will have to ultimately agree with one not the other. \n  Consider the judgments in Cases B, C and D and their discussion concerning the ratio in Case A and the reasons for fnding themselves bound by it. \n  Finally, formulate a rule of law based on your interpretation of Cases A, B, C and D, and apply this to your reasoning in Case E. \nInterpreting precedent in practice \nPart of the lawyer’s particular expertise is in knowing how to quickly look through past cases to fnd relevant decisions which either support or oppose a client’s case. Searches can be made, frst, to pinpoint cases dealing with specifc legal rules. A range of cases with similar facts can then be pulled from this frst trawl of data. After careful reading, the lawyer must then construct detailed arguments drawing on those similarities with other cases that will support the client’s position, or negate the potential precedent value of cases that would not help the client. This latter skill is called distinguishing , and it is par -\nticularly important for those who wish to argue that a precedent should not be followed. \n\n--- Page 253 ---\n    \n         \n 222 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nA lawyer may need to argue convincingly that the part of the previous judgment that \nthe opposing counsel is relying upon is not part of the reasoning process leading to \njudgment; that it was an ‘aside’ comment, based on a hypothetical situation (technically referred to as an obiter dictum  comment). On the other hand, this may be the only argu -\nment that a lawyer has to support the client’s position. If an obiter dictum  comment was \nmade by a senior judge in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, and it is of direct relevance to the exact circumstances of the present case, then it could be argued that this is an important indicator of what that court would do if such a case came before it. \nWhere there is more than one judgment, the lawyer’s task in ascertaining the strength \nof a precedent may be more diffcult. It is possible that a dissenting judgment could even -\ntually come to represent the majority view of an area of law. If the judge who is dissenting has a particular reputation for excellence, then the dissenting judgment will be seriously considered by those coming to read the case for the precedential value of the majority judgments. \nAn understanding of the doctrine of precedent and the ability to locate the reasoning in \na case or series of cases is vital if the lawyer is to succeed in any of these tasks. \nThe practical implementation of the doctrine of precedent \nUnfortunately for law students there are no simple shortcuts to understanding the practi-cal everyday working of the doctrine of precedent in the courts. You will need to read, make notes on, interpret and think about the judgments you are reading and be confdent in your ability to handle and use law reports. \nHandling law reports \nFigure 8 .6 sets out the issues to be considered when handling law reports. \nEngaging with the language of judgments \nLaw reports can present a challenge to students both in terms of their legal content and their usage of sophisticated and complex language. It is useful to consider the law report not just as an offcial public document but also as a literary text.\n8 The examples and illus -\ntrations used may be drawn from many spheres, including politics, history, art, religion or literature. They may include quotations from different languages or be liberally peppered with Latin legal maxims (such as stare decisis). \nYou will need to develop your skills in reading, language and writing in order to be able \nto obtain: \n  a good grasp of the relevant area of substantive law; \n  an appreciation of issues relating to language usage; \n8 In recent years a growing number of scholars have become interested in exploring law as a literary text and \nin exploring literary texts as mirrors of the law. See T Ziolkowski The Mirror of Justice: Literary Refections \nof Legal Crisis (Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2003). For a classic work of fction exploring the ideology of law you may be interested to read F Kafka, The Trial  (Random House Press, New York, 1956). \n\n--- Page 254 ---\n     \n \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 223 \n1. \nCOURT • Name of the Court \n• e.g. Supreme Court \n2. \nCASE \nNAME • Case Name: • e.g. George Mitchell v Finney Lock Seeds \n3. \nCITATIONS • Cita˜ons • Neutral cita˜on post 2001.

There may have been a general agreement that such a rule existed, but no such rule had been specifcally created by a court or Parliament. These can be described as cases that are sources of law . They are strictly binding on courts according to their \nplace in the hierarchy. \n(2) Those cases where the judge(s) are grappling with the meaning of legislative words and phrases in order to determine the case. These are cases involving statutory inter -\npretation , that is, the judicial determination of the meaning of words and/or phrases \nin a statute. Here the decision of a senior court concerning the meaning of those words is treated as binding in subsequent cases until challenged. \nFrom the mid-twentieth century the majority of cases have fallen into category 2: statu -\ntory interpretation. Often this application will be purely a matter of routine, but sometimes doubts will arise about the meaning of words in the relevant legislation. The rules of statu -\ntory interpretation are discussed in more detail in Chapter 7 . \nReading a law report: a series of guided exercises on 1983 case of George Mitchell \n(Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds\n9 (George Mitchell case) \nWe will now turn to a range of practical demonstrations concerning how to read a law \nreport using the George Mitchell case. We will approach it using a range of detailed exer -\ncises and studies which, taken together, are designed to demonstrate a methodology for the competent reading of law reports, taking case notes, evaluating the case, and using it to construct legal arguments. \nWe will deal with: \n  The anatomy of a law report, being comfortable with print and online formats. \n  Obtaining a general overview of the case. \n  Best practice when writing case notes. \n  Breaking into text generally and specifcally. \n  How to engage in a detailed reading of the judgment in this case to assist with under -\nstanding and summarising. This is also designed to help you follow the analysis in the case of a complex issue of the relationship between the common law limiting liability \n9 [1983] 2 AC. \n\n--- Page 256 ---\n     \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 225 \nfor loss and protective statutory rules that run alongside them prohibiting the use of the common law rules if certain statutory criteria apply. \n  Evaluation of the case to use it in the construction of legal argument. \nTo best use these studies and exercises for the development of your understanding of reading law reports and the law, it would be ideal if you have the Westlaw database ver -\nsion of the case open as well as the Westlaw pdf of the print version. While you will effec -\ntively have two windows with seemingly identical text, the print version layout is different and this should be noted. \nThe anatomy of a law report \nBefore you can read a law report with confdence it is essential to understand the layout of standard law reports. Indeed it is crucial to understand how a law report is compiled and to distinguish between the notes by the barrister who is reporting the case, earlier hearings prior to the appeal you may be reading and the judgments in the case you are reading. \nOnly the judgments given by the judges are the legal part of the report, capable of \nmaking common law or interpreting the existing common law and statutory law with legal authority. \nFigure 8 .7 shows you the differing parts of a law report, although you will not fnd these \nheadings in the report itself. This is followed by Figure 8 .8, which is a snapshot of the frst \ntwo pages of the print version of the report of George Mitchell v Finney Lock Seeds as \nfound in the ICLR Law Reports , Appeal Cases  series. Follow the pdf version on Westlaw \nof the original print version. Figure 8 .8 is annotated with the headings in Figure 8 .9. \nThe next few pages of the law report deal with the arguments of counsel, which are \nfollowed by judgments beginning with Lord Diplock on page 809; he agrees with the judg -\nment of Lord Bridge but wished to make a few salient points. Lords Scarman and Rothwell state on page 810 in two or three lines that they too agree with the judgment of Lord Bridge. It is Lord Bridge’s judgment that we will dissect later in this series of exercises. \nIt is far more likely that you will use a database to read cases. It can give greater \ninformation. A quick search of the Westlaw database retrieves the reports of the three hearings in the case (in the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords) as indicated by the screenshot in Figure 8 .10. \nYou will note that the frst entry is the report of the case heard by the House of Lords \non 30 June 1983. The second is the report of the Court of Appeal (civil division) hear -\ning and the third is the report of the hearing in the Queen’s Bench Division (commercial court). If you are in a rush, it can be easy to access the wrong hearing of the case. Use the citation to check which one is the right one to read. \nThe frst source contains two blue hyperlinks [1983] AC 803 and [1983] 3 WLR 163. You \nwant to read the version that is highest in the hierarchy of law reporting – in this instance [1983] AC 803. When you frst locate the case on Westlaw, it will appear on screen as illustrated in Figure 8 .10. Note the arrow to the pdf version. Figure 8 .7 shows the begin -\nning of the pdf version. \n\n--- Page 257 ---\n    \n  226 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nFigure 8.7 The anatomy of a standard law report (using the George Mitchell case) \n\n--- Page 258 ---\n     \n  \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 227 \nFigure 8.8 Anatomy of a law report: frst two pages of ICLR Appeal Court law report of George Mitchell v \nFinney Lock Seeds [1983] 2 AC 803 \nFigure 8.9 Screenshot of George Mitchell v Finney Lock Seeds \n\n--- Page 259 ---\n    \n \n \n \n \n   228 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nFigure 8.10 Screenshot of retrieved case of George Mitchell v Finney Lock Seeds indicating anatomy of the \nreport as shown \nObtaining a general overview of the case \nInitially you should approach the case as though you are engaging in it as an English \ncomprehension exercise. This will show how far you can get by close and careful reading without a detailed knowledge of the law (in this case, the law of contract). \nThis exercise requires your active  engagement. You will be given the context of the \ncase, so that you are not working completely in the dark, before being guided through several stages of reading. \nThe context of the case \nWhilst you do not need any pre-knowledge for this exercise it is of course useful if you understand the legal context of the dispute in a case. For this reason, the basic frame -\nwork of the law of contract is set out in Figure 8 .11. The triangles denote the basic stages \nof making a contract, living or keeping it, and ending it. \nA contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties. Usually a \ncontract will contain provisions that outline the compensation payable to one party should the other break the contract by not fulflling their obligations under the terms of that contract. \n\n--- Page 260 ---\n229   READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES\nThe events which occur in George Mitchell  are summarised in the square by the tri -\nangle labelled ‘Ending it’. Look at the circular flow of reasons for ending the contract and \nnote what each one is. This case does not concern a mutual agreement to end the con -\ntract, or it coming naturally to an end. This case is set in the text box dealing with one of \nthe parties being accused of breaking the contract, and as a consequence compensation \nis requested.Figure 8.11  The basic framework of the law of contract\n\n--- Page 261 ---\n    \n  \n  \n  \n      \n  \n    \n  230 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nThe facts of the case \nThe contract in this case concerned the purchase of cabbage seed by George Mitchell, the plaintiff company (now referred to as the ‘claimant’) from Finney Lock Seeds, the defendant company. The contract contained a clause stating that damages for breaking the contract (breach of contract) were subject to a damages limitation clause. This clause provided that if the seeds were defective, any damages payable would be limited to the replacement of the seeds purchased. The buyer would not be compensated for any other loss, for example, loss of profts due to having defective seeds. The plaintiff company engaged in industrial farming and purchased the cabbage seeds to grow for the next year. The seeds proved defective and the crop failed, leading to large proft losses. \nThis case is particularly interesting because it is an example of a situation in which \ncommon law rules, created by the judges in previous cases, can operate alongside statu -\ntory rules dealing with the same subject. \nThe basic reading of the case \nTo identify the main issues in the case requires some determination. If you are able to master the methodology used here, you will be able to apply it to other cases. \nStage 1 has been divided into four tasks for you to engage with: \n(1) Locate the case online or in print, and turn to the judgment of Lord Bridge. Read it as quickly as you can but ensure you understand what you are reading, and time yourself. Do not take notes. If this reading takes you more than 60 minutes you need to work on your reading strategies generally. \n(2) Now read the entire law report, being aware of the different types of information given: \n(a) names of the judges; \n(b) court and dates of appeal; \n(c) catchwords added by the publisher; \n(d) summaries of the fnding in previous courts dealing; with this case, constructed by the reporter; \n(e) summaries of the arguments of counsel for both parties; \n(f) all judgments will be reported as near to verbatim as possible; \n(g) the outcome of the appeal you are reading. \n(3) The judgments that you read are the part of the law report that contains the law. As you read the judgment note how each paragraph begins and ends. You will often fnd signposts to meaning at the beginning and end of paragraphs, and they may contain indicators of the progression of a discussion or argument. Note any technical language. Look up words you do not understand in a good English dictionary or law dictionary. Try and extract the issue that is the ground of appeal and the reasoning that has led to the outcome in the case. Write summary notes as you go along to help your understanding. \n\n--- Page 262 ---\n     \n  \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 231 \n(4) Finally summarise in writing, in no more than 200 words, what this case is about: \n(a) Identifying the court, facts and legal issues relevant to the appeal; \n(b) Indicating the reasons for the decision in this case. \n(i) You will fnd that knowledge of facts or of the applicable rules taken alone will not help you identify the reasoning in the case. You need to look for passages in the text that discuss the reasons why those rules applied to those facts, which led to a particular outcome being decided by the court. \nDo not proceed any further until you have quickly read the case and completed the above Tasks 1–4. \nConsideration of your summary for task 4 \nLook at your summary and compare it to the example case summary below. \nSummary of George Mitchell v Finney Lock Seeds  [1983] 2 AC 803 \nThis is an appeal case in the House of Lords. The appellant, a commercial agricultural company \nplaced an order for a specifc type of seed. The supplier sent the wrong seeds and the crop failed leading to a large loss of profts. \nThe contract between the appellants and respondents for the supply of seed contained a \nlimitation clause limiting compensation payable to the cost of replacement seeds. The major fnancial loss incurred by the buyer due to the wrong seeds being sent was far in excess of the cost of the seeds. \nThe trial court said that the seller was liable to pay full compensation. The seller appealed to \nthe Court of Appeal and lost. He then appealed to the House of Lords and again lost on the grounds that the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 took priority over the operation of the common law rule allowing such limitation clauses. \nA particular complicating issue concerned whether the contract was made within a range of \ndates specifed in the legislation. \nAt trial, and on appeal to the Court of Appeal and on appeal to the House of Lords, the buyer \nwon the case. The court held that although at common law the limitation clause was operative, it was rendered inoperative by the application of the Unfair Contracts Act 1977. Therefore the buyer was entitled to receive compensation from the seller for loss of profts as well as the replacement of seeds. \nAlways consider what a reader of your summary needs to know to make sense of the \ncase, and apply it to other situations. \nWhat is useful in the suggested case summary \nIt gives a full summary of the facts, and details the reasons for the dispute and makes clear the issue at stake is whether a common law rule on limitation clauses should apply or \n\n--- Page 263 ---\n    232 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nwhether the common law here is inoperative due to the application of the Unfair Contract \nTerms Act. However, it still has problems: \n  We do not have precise information on the grounds of appeal, just generalised \ngrounds. You must always give the specifc grounds of appeal. \n  We still do not know why  the Court of Appeal decided the case as it did. We are just \ntold that the court noted the common law provision was inoperative because of the Unfair Contracts Terms Act 1977. We do not have the reasoning in the case. Yet, the reasoning is key for an understanding of the operation of the doctrine of precedent. \n  We do not know the case law establishing the common law rules. \n  We do not have precise information on applicable statutory rules. \n  We do not have the basic information on the judges sitting and the dates of hearing. \nIf your summary contained all of the information in the suggested case summary above, you are certainly on the right track. If not, do take the time to consider why you did not pick up on the points in the summary. It is particularly important to know the procedural history of the case. Look at Figure 8 .12, which gives information on this point gained from \na reading of the headnote and confrmed in reading of the judgments. Remember, details in the headnote could be wrong so do check in the judgments. \nWe will return to these summaries at the end of this chapter in the section ‘writing a \nusable case note’. Constructing a competent case note of a law report is the core skill for all students and practitioners. \nHow to break into diffcult text \nDuring the drafting of your case note you may have found it diffcult to identify and under -\nstand the main issues in the case. Whilst it may not be too diffcult to locate the specifc sentences where the judge says what the issues are, you may have to work hard to under -\nstand the narrative, as the judgment will inevitably include unfamiliar vocabulary or legal references, complex grammatical structures and dense text. \nIn his judgment Lord Bridge gave a particular label to the limitation clause at the centre \nof the case. He called it ‘the relevant condition’ and identifed two issues in the case on page 811 in paragraphs G–H of his judgment. \nG The frst issue is whether the relevant condition, on its true construction in the context of \nthe contract as a whole, is effective to limit the appellant’s liability to a refund of the price of the seeds (‘the common law issue ’). The second issue is whether, if the common law issue is \ndecided in the appellant’s favour, they should nevertheless be precluded from reliance on this limitation of liability pursuant to the \nH provisions of the modifed s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which is set out in para \n11 of Schedule 1 to the Act and which applies to contracts made between 18 May 1973 and 1 February 1978 (the statutory issue ). \nLord Bridge on page 811 (print or pdf Westlaw version). \n\n--- Page 264 ---\nREADING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 233  \nFigure 8.12  The procedural history of the case \n\n--- Page 265 ---\n    \n  \n  \n 234 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nAlthough at frst sight this text is diffcult to follow, note that Lord Bridge gives the two \nissues in the case shorthand labels, as set out below. (Both labels are underlined  in the \nblue text box above.) \n(1) The frst issue concerns whether the limitation clause is effective and limits the liabil -\nity of Finney Lock Seeds. He calls this the ‘common law issue’. \n(2) The second issue only needs discussion if the answer to (1) is that the limitation clause is effective. The question then is whether statutory protection should override the common law rule and prohibit the seller from relying on the limitation clause. This is the ‘statutory issue’. \nThe entire text is diffcult so how do you break into it? The following section gives some strategies for breaking down the text into manageable sections using the text in the blue text box above. \nA frst strategy for breaking into the text is to remember that each paragraph is con -\nnected to the paragraphs above and below it. If you are ever stuck with your reading, stop and re-read the paragraphs above and below the one you are struggling with. This may be enough to resolve your diffculty. Each paragraph usually contains a main topic sentence which is then elaborated upon in the remaining sentences. \nStrategy 1 \nOne way of trying to understand a paragraph that is causing you problems is to set it out with divisions and spaces. The text above in the blue text box has been set out in such a manner in Figure 8 .13, which is annotated below. Figures 8 .14 and 8.15  demonstrate the \nannotation of the language of paragraph G and H. Figure 8 .14 deals with the frst issue, \nand Figure 8 .15 deals with the second issue. \nThis activity will reveal where you lack understanding, highlight the areas of intercon -\nnection and help you to identify words and phrases that need clarifcation. Remember that where a statute is concerned the actual words are fxed in law by the statute. When dealing with a judgment, any common rules contained and constructed in the judgment do not fx rules with specifc words. It is said that the decisions of judges state rules in an unfxed verbal format. \nStrategy 2 \nThe text could be set out as a diagram, and this is illustrated by Figure 8 .14, which deals \nwith the frst issue referred to in paragraph G of the judgment. Additionally Figure 8 .14 \nhas been annotated using three ‘Understanding check’ boxes in white. These pose ques -\ntions or give information. They could also be used in conjunction with the text layout in Figure 8 .13. The white boxes test your understanding of the text you are reading and its \ncontext. It is essential to relate what you are reading back to the information you already \n\n--- Page 266 ---\n     \n \n \n \n \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 235 \nG The frst issue is : \nwhether the relevant condi\ron, \n[onits true construc\ron in the context of the contract as a whole] \nis e˜ec°ve \n[to limit the appellant’s liability to a refund of the price of the seed s \n(‘the-common law issue’ ).] \nH The second issue is : \nwhether, \nif the common law issue is decided in the appellant’s fa vour , \nthey should nevertheless \nbe preclude d from re liance \non this limita\ron of liability \npursuant to th e \nprovisions of the modifed s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 19 79 \nwhich is set out in para 11 of  Schedule 1 to the Ac t \nandwhich appl ies to contracts \nmade betw een 18 May 1973 and 1 February 1978                        \n(‘the statutory issue’ ). \nFigure 8.13 Verbatim text of G & H of Lord Bridge’s judgment on p 811 set out in different text layout to aid \nunderstanding \npossess and view it in light of that information. Context is everything in the process of \nreading law reports. \nStrategy 3 \nFigure 8 .15 deals with paragraphs G and H in Lord Bridge’s judgment, dealing only with \nthe second issue. It takes the whole text approach without reformatting its layout as in Figure 8 .13 and gives annotations that purely relate to the relationship of one part of the \ntext to another. We could more formally call it a diagram giving only internal annotation. No external information beyond the words of the text is given (unlike the annotations in Figure 8 .14, which deal with external matters to aid understanding). \nYou can use any method you like that works for you to break into diffcult text and \nascertain its meaning in context. \n\n--- Page 267 ---\n236 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES  \nUnderstanding check:  \nWhat does it mean to say this is a \ncommon law issue? \nCommon law is the law made through   \nprecedent in the courts.  \nContract is a creature o f prec edent not \nParliament.  \nBut over the yea rs, Parliame nt has \ninterven ed to protec tpar/g415es  from cas es \nwhen the opera/g415on of the c ommon law \nacts to the clear disa dvantage of the \nwronged party.\nStatute has the power to change the  \ncommon law  because the co mmon law is \nsubser vient to it.Understanding check:\nQ: Why does it ma/g425er if it limits liab ility \nto the price of the seeds?

You may fnd it useful to glance back to Figure 8 .12 and note the basic procedural history outlined there. This will enable you to \nobtain an appreciation of the differences in opinion by the various judges who have con -\nsidered the case before its arrival in the House of Lords. \nInitially the case was won by the buyers of the seed in the trial court (the High Court). \nThe buyers were the original claimants,\n10 George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd. The sellers of \nthe seed, Finney Lock Seeds (the defendants), in the High Court immediately appealed to the Court of Appeal, where they become the appellants, and they again lost. This did not deter them and they appealed to the House of Lords, where they also lost. There was a lot of money at stake: the difference between the £201.60 that the seeds cost or the £90,000+ that the trial judge awarded for loss of profts. \nHaving read and considered the wording of the two issues in the case, we can see that \nif the appellants succeed in Issue 1 they may still fail overall if they fail over Issue 2. Can you understand why? (The answer is in the frst sentence setting out ‘the second issue’, see Figure 8 .15.) Logically, one would expect Lord Bridge to commence with the arguments over \nIssue 1, the common law issue, as this is the gateway to an argument over Issue 2, which would only take place if Issue 1 is decided in the appellant’s favour. Until all of these matters are linked and understood it is not possible to fully comprehend the reasoning in the case. \nBy now you will have read Lord Bridge’s speech several times and you should appreci -\nate that the arguments in this case are quite complex. \nVery early on in his judgment, Lord Bridge organises the disputed limitation by saying \nthat ‘the issues in the appeal arise from three sentences in the conditions of sale’ and are part of the terms of the contract. To make things easy he numbers these as 1, 2 and 3. He then states that he will call each sentence a clause, as shown in Figure 8.16 . You will recall \nthat we have already discussed the meaning of ‘relevant condition’, and the two issues Lord Bridge splits the case into. \nIt is important that you do not miss such relabelling; if you do, you would not be able \nto follow the discussion about it! The structure he imposes is set out below using his verbatim words. \nIn order to break into the whole judgment of Lord Bridge, it has been set out in a \nthree-column table. Column 1 allocates numbers to sections of verbatim text. Column 2 contains the verbatim text of Lord Bridge. Where it is considered useful, each num -\nbered section of verbatim text is summarised in column 3. As far as possible, each num -\nbered section relates to a paragraph. \nWriting a précis  of each paragraph helps you to understand each of the different ideas. \nOnce you have achieved mastery at reading law texts you will no longer need to write \ndown your précis , but will automatically take in the contexts and signals in the text, only \noccasionally writing down an idea or proposition in an argument. \n10 Although at the time of this case in 1983 they would have been called plaintiffs. \n\n--- Page 270 ---\n239   READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES\nEach paragraph is a stepping stone, leading the reader to the end of the text and the \nconclusion of the argument. As paragraphs relate to one another you should not skip \nany in your reading. If you do not understand something in a paragraph, read the earlier \nparagraphs and those after it to help clarify the issues. If you find references you do not \nunderstand cast your eyes back to see if this has already been clarified.\nLord Bridge’s judgment has been split into 22 sections of text which are set out in \nTable 8 .1.\nACTIVITY\n (1) Read Lord Bridge’s judgment from numbered text [1]–[22].\n (2) As you read, without reading the summary in column 3, consider whether you under -\nstood the original text.

George \nMitchell ν Finney Lock Seeds 1983 2 AC 803: VERBATIM TEXT Summary of paragraph \n[1] My Lords, the appellants are seed merchants. The respondents are farmers \nin East Lothian. In December 1973 the respondents ordered from the appellants 30 lb of Dutch winter white cabbage seeds. The seeds supplied were invoiced as Finney’s ‘Late Dutch Special’. The price was £201.60. Finney’s Late Dutch Special was the variety required by the respondents. It is a Dutch winter white cabbage which grows particularly well in the acres of East Lothian where the respondent’s farm, and can be harvested and sold at a favourable price in the spring. The respondents planted some 63 acres of their land with seedlings grown from the seeds supplied by the appellants to produce their cabbage crop for the spring of 1975. In the event, the crop proved to be worthless and had to be ploughed in. This was for two reasons. First, the seeds supplied were not Finney’s Late Dutch Special or any other variety of Dutch winter white cabbage, but a variety of autumn cabbage. Second, even as autumn cabbage, the seeds were of very inferior quality Facts set out. The seller delivered the wrong cabbage seed and inferior seed to the buyer who, as a consequence, had a failed crop with grave f nancial consequences. The contract of sale limited the seller’s liability to a refund of the price of the seeds \n[2] The issues in the appeal arise from three sentences in the conditions of sale indorsed on the appellants’ invoice and admittedly embodied in the terms on which the appellants contracted. For ease of reference it will be convenient to number the sentences. Omitting immaterial words they read as follows: (1) In the event of any seeds or plants sold or agreed to be sold by us not complying with the express terms of the contract of sale... or any seeds or plants proving defective in varietal purity we will, at our option, replace Issues arise from three sentences in the conditions of sale. These are set out and identif ed. Lord Bridge states he will call the contentious limitation clause ‘the relevant condition’, and will refer to each sentence as a clause, so clauses 1, 2, 3. If a student reads carelessly this important explanation will be overlooked, then the phrase ‘relevant condition’ and ‘clauses 1, 2, 3’ will cause confusion when they are used later in the text to refer to his divisions of the contentious limitation clause \n\n--- Page 272 ---\n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 241 the defective seeds or plants, free of charge to the buyer or will refund all \npayments made to us by the buyer in respect of the defective seeds or plants and this shall be the limit of our obligation. (2) We hereby exclude all liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any seeds or plants supplied by us and for any consequential loss or damage arising out of such use or any failure in the performance of or any defect in any seeds or plants supplied by us or for any other loss or damage whatsoever save for, at our option, liability for any such replacement or refund as aforesaid.

The secondissue is whether, if the common law issue is decided in the appellants’ favour,they should nevertheless be precluded from reliance on this limitation of liabilitypursuant to the provisions of the modif ed s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979,which is set out in para 11 of Sch 1 to the Act and which applies to contractsmade between 18 May 1973 and 1 February 1978 (the statutory issue) Sets out the two issues as the common law and the statutory issues.Gives details of relevant legislation \n[4] \nThe trial judge, Parker J, on the basis of evidence that the seeds supplied were incapable of producing a commercially saleable crop, decided the \ncommon law issue against the appellants on the ground that:\nwhat was supplied … was in no commercial sense vegetable seed at all [but was] the delivery of something wholly different in kind from that which was ordered and which the defendants had agreed to supply.\nHe accordingly found it unnecessary to decide the statutory issue, but helpfullymade some important f ndings of fact, which are very relevant if that issue fallsto be decided. He gave judgment in favour of the respondents for £61,513.78damages and £30,756 interest. Nothing now turns on these f gures, but it isperhaps signif cant to point out that the damages awarded do not representmerely ‘loss of anticipated prof t’, as was erroneously suggested in theappellants’ printed case. The f gure includes, as counsel for the appellants veryproperly accepted, all the costs incurred by the respondents in the cultivationof the worthless crop as well as the prof t they would have expected to makefrom a successful crop if the proper seeds had been supplied Discusses the f nding of the trial judge that under the common law the ‘relevant condition’ could not be relied upon by the sellers. The reason being the seed delivered was ‘wholly different’. (As we have already noted, Issue 2, the statutory issue, need only be dealt with if Issue 1 is decided in favour of the sellers)\n(Continued) \n\n--- Page 273 ---\n       \n \n 242 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nTABLE 8.1 (CONTINIUED) COMPARING VERBATIM TEXT OF LORD BRIDGE’S JUDGMENT IN GEORGE MITCHELL V \nFINNEY LOCK SEEDS  ILLUSTRATING ACCURATE SUMMARISING OF THE RANGE OF LEGAL ISSUES AND \nTHE ARGUMENT AS IT IS BUILT BY LORD BRIDGE \nPara Lord Bridge: Judgment (divided into numbered paragraphs). George \nMitchell ν Finney Lock Seeds 1983 2 AC 803: VERBATIM TEXT Summary of paragraph \n[5] In the Court of Appeal, the common law issue was decided in favour of the \nappellants by Lord Denning MR, who said ([1983] 1 All ER 108, ρ 113; [1983] QB 284, ρ 296): On the natural interpretation, I think the condition is suff cient to limit the seed merchants to a refund of the price paid or replacement of the seeds. Oliver LJ decided the common law issue against the appellants primarily on a ground akin to that of Parker J, albeit somewhat differently expressed. Fastening on the words ‘agreed to be sold’ in cl 1 of the relevant condition, he held that the clause could not be construed to mean ‘in the event of the seeds sold or agreed to be sold by us not being the seed agreed to be sold by us’. Clause 2 of the relevant condition he held to be ‘merely a supplement’ to cl 1. He thus arrived at the conclusion Discusses the f nding of Denning LJ in the Court of Appeal. Denning LJ thought the common law issue should be decided in favour of the sellers. He said that the wording of the condition was suff cient to cover the situation.Kerr and Oliver LJJ decided the common law issue against the sellers. Kerr LJ’s reasoning was that the condition would only cover them for defects  in the \n‘correct ’ named seeds. Not for delivery of the wrong \nseeds.Oliver LJ’s reasoning was that the condition did not cover the breach because it only happened through the negligence of the seller \nthat the appellants had only succeeded in limiting their liability arising from the supply of seeds which were correctly described as Finney’s Late Dutch Special but were defective in quality. As the seeds supplied were not Finney’s Late Dutch Special, the relevant condition gave them no protection. Kerr LJ, in whose reasoning Oliver LJ also concurred, decided the common law issue against the appellants on the ground that the relevant condition was ineffective to limit the appellants’ liability for a breach of contract, which could not have occurred without negligence on the appellants’ part, and that the supply of the wrong variety of seeds was such a breach\n[6] The Court of Appeal, however, was unanimous in deciding the statutory issue against the appellants The Court of Appeal, however, was unanimous in deciding the statutory issue against the sellers \n\n--- Page 274 ---\n      \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 243 [7] In his judgment, Lord Denning MR traces, in his uniquely colourful and \ngraphic style, the history of the courts’ approach to contractual clauses \nexcluding or limiting liability, culminating in the intervention of the legislature, \nf rst, by the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973, and second, by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. My Lords, in considering the common law issue, I will resist the temptation to follow that fascinating trail, but will content myself with references to the two recent decisions of your Lordship’s House commonly called the two Securicor cases: Photo Production Ltd ν Securicor Transport Ltd  [1980] 1 All ER 996; [1980] AC 827 and Ailsa Craig \nFishing Co Ltd ν Malvern Fishing Co Ltd [1983] 1 All ER 101 Refers to Denning LJ in Court of Appeal, tracing the history of the court’s approach to limitation or exclusion conditions. Lord Bridge picks out two relevant cases {Photo Production Ltd ν Securicor Transport Ltd  [1980] 1 All ER 101 and Ailsa Craig \nFishing Co Ltd ν Malvern Fishing Co Ltd [1983] 1 All ER 101) and uses these to explore the common law issue. Note that the judge is beginning to deal with cases decided previously and commenting upon them in relation to whether he is bound by the doctrine of precedent \n[8] \nThe Photo Production  case gave the f nal quietus to the doctrine that\na ‘fundamental breach’ of contract deprived the party in breach of thebenef t of clauses in the contract excluding or limiting his liability. The\nAilsa Craig  case drew an important distinction between exclusion and\nlimitation clauses. This is clearly stated by Lord Fraser ([1983] 1 All ER\n101, p 105):\nThere are later authorities which lay down very strict principles to beapplied when considering the effect of clauses of exclusion or of indemnity:see particularly the Privy Council case of \nCanada Steamship Lines Ltd ν  R\n[1952] 1 All ER 305 at 310 [1952] AC 192, 208, where Lord Morton, deliveringthe advice of the Board, summarised the principles in terms which haverecently been applied by this House in \nSmith ν UMB Chrysler (Scotland) Ltd\n1978 SC (HL) 1. In my opinion these principles are not applicable in theirfull rigour when considering the effect of conditions merely limiting liability.Such conditions will of course be read \ncontra proferentem  and must be\nclearly expressed, but there is no reason why they should be judged by thespecially exacting standards which are applied to exclusion and indemnity\nclauses Lord Bridge brings up the phrase ‘fundamental breach’. The word ‘fundamental’ suggests an important breach or break of the contract. The essence of the points made are that: – the Photo Production  case made it clear that, even if \nthere is a f nding of fundamental breach of contract by one party, like the seller here, this f nding does not stop a party, the seller, relying on limiting or excluding conditions in the contract; \n– the Ailsa Craig case drew distinctions between:\nlimiting clauses and exclusion clauses Basically, \nlimitation clauses should not be judged according to the strict principles applied to exclusion clauses, although they remain to be construed contra proferentem  against the party claiming their protection \n{contra proferentem  means construed strictly/against\nthe party relying on it) \n(Continued) \n\n--- Page 275 ---\n     \n    \n \n 244 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nTABLE 8.1 (CONTINIUED) COMPARING VERBATIM TEXT OF LORD BRIDGE’S JUDGMENT IN GEORGE MITCHELL V \nFINNEY LOCK SEEDS  ILLUSTRATING ACCURATE SUMMARISING OF THE RANGE OF LEGAL ISSUES AND \nTHE ARGUMENT AS IT IS BUILT BY LORD BRIDGE \nPara Lord Bridge: Judgment (divided into numbered paragraphs). George \nMitchell ν Finney Lock Seeds 1983 2 AC 803: VERBATIM TEXT Summary of paragraph \n[9] My Lords, it seems to me, with all due deference, that the judgments of the \ntrial judge and of Oliver LJ on the common law issue come dangerously\nnear to reintroducing by the back door the doctrine of ‘fundamental breach’ \nwhich this House in the Photo Production  case had so forcibly evicted by the \nfront. The judge discusses what I may call the ‘peas and beans’ or ‘chalk and cheese’ cases, i.e., those in which it has been held that exemption clauses do not apply where there has been a contract to sell one thing, e.g. a motor car, and the seller has supplied quite another thing, e.g. a bicycle. I hasten to add that the judge can in no way be criticised for adopting this approach since counsel appearing for the appellants at the trial had conceded ‘that, if what had been delivered had been beetroot seed or carrot seed, he would not be able to rely on the clause’. Different counsel appeared for the appellants in the Court of Appeal, where that concession was withdrawn Lord Bridge criticises the trial judge, Parker J, and the Court of Appeal judge, Oliver LJ, for trying to go back to the position before the Photo Production  case. Lord \nBridge said a fundamental breach does not stop a party from relying on exclusions or limitation clauses \n[10] In my opinion, this is not a ‘peas and beans’ case at all. The relevant condition applies to ‘seeds’. Clause 1 refers to ‘seeds sold’ and ‘seeds agreed to be sold.’ Clause 2 refers to ‘seeds supplied’As I have pointed out, Oliver LJ concentrated his attention on the phrase ‘seeds agreed to be sold’. I can see no justif cation, with respect, for allowing this phrase alone to dictate the interpretation of the relevant condition, still less for treating cl 2 as ‘merely a supplement’ to cl 1. Clause 2 is perfectly clear and unambiguous. The reference to ‘seeds agreed to be sold’ as well as to ‘seeds sold’ in cl 1 ref ects the same dichotomy as the def nition of ‘sale’ in the Sale of Goods Act 1979 as including a bargain and sale as well Lord Bridge points out that the condition applies to seeds sold and indeed seeds were sold!Lord Bridge says that the condition unambiguouslyapplies to the present situation \n\n--- Page 276 ---\n      \n \n \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 245 as a sale and delivery. The defective seeds in this case were seeds sold and \ndelivered, just as clearly as they were seeds supplied, by the appellants to \nthe respondents. The relevant condition, read as a whole, unambiguously\nlimits the appellants’ liability to a replacement of the seeds or refund of the price. It is only possible to read an ambiguity into it by the process of strained construction, which was deprecated by Lord Diplock in the Photo Production case [1980] 1 All ER 556, ρ 568; [1980] AC 82, ρ 851 and by Lord Wilberforce in the Ailsa Craig case [1983] 1 All ER 101, ρ 102 \n[11] In holding that the relevant condition was ineffective to limit the appellants’ liability for a breach of contract caused by their negligence, Kerr LJ applied the principles stated by Lord Morton giving the judgment of the Privy Council in Canada Steamship Lines Ltd ν R [1952] 1 All ER 303, ρ 310; [1952] AC 192, ρ 208. Kerr LJ stated correctly that this case was also referred to by Lord Fraser in the Ailsa Craig case [1983] 1 All ER 101, ρ 105. He omitted, however, to notice that, as appears from the passage from Lord Fraser’s speech which I have already cited, the whole point of Lord Fraser’s reference was to express his opinion that the very strict principles laid down in the Canada Steamship Lines  case as applicable to exclusion and indemnity clauses \ncannot be applied in their full rigour to limitation clauses. Lord Wilberforce’s speech contains a passage to the like effect, and Lord Elwyn Jones, Lord Salmon and Lord Lowry agreed with both speeches. Having once reached \na conclusion in the instant case that the relevant condition unambiguously\nlimited the appellants’ liability, I know of no principle of construction which can properly be applied to conf ne the effect of the limitation to breaches of contract arising without negligence on the part of the appellants. In agreement with Lord Denning MR, I would decide the common law issue in the appellants’ favour Lord Bridge says that Kerr LJ (in the Court of Appeal) in f nding for the seller had in fact misinterpreted what Lord Fraser had said about The Canada Steamship ν R [1952] 1 All ER 303 in the Ailsa Craig case! This is an excellent paragraph for demonstrating the way in which judges argue about other cases, following, distinguishing, overruling or stating the precedent of a case erroneously.Lord Bridge decides the common law point in favour of the sellers in agreement with Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal \n(Continued) \n\n--- Page 277 ---\n    \n \n \n \n    \n \n 246 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nTABLE 8.1 (CONTINIUED) COMPARING VERBATIM TEXT OF LORD BRIDGE’S JUDGMENT IN GEORGE MITCHELL V \nFINNEY LOCK SEEDS  ILLUSTRATING ACCURATE SUMMARISING OF THE RANGE OF LEGAL ISSUES AND \nTHE ARGUMENT AS IT IS BUILT BY LORD BRIDGE \nPara Lord Bridge: Judgment (divided into numbered paragraphs). George \nMitchell ν Finney Lock Seeds 1983 2 AC 803: VERBATIM TEXT Summary of paragraph \n[12] The statutory issue turns, as already indicated, on the application of the \nprovisions of the modif ed s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, as set out in para 11 of Sch 1 to the Act. The 1979 Act is a pure consolidation. The purpose of the modif ed s 55 is to preserve the law as it stood from 18 May 1973 to 1 February 1978 in relation to contracts made between those two dates. The signif cance of the dates is that the f rst was the date when the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 came into force containing the provision now re-enacted by the modif ed s 55, the second was the date when the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 came into force and superseded the relevant provisions of the Act of 1973 by more radical and far-reaching \nprovisions in relation to contracts made thereafter Lord Bridge turns to discuss the ‘statutory’ issue.We now begin to understand the reference to ‘the Act’ in Issue 2 as set out by Lord Bridge at para 2. The modif ed s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 is set out. The Sale of Goods Act 1979 was a statute that was pure consolidation. (This means that it merely collected together the existing law and put it in one place.)Modif ed s 55 preserves the law between 18 May 1973 (the date that the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act came into force) and 1 February 1977 (the date that the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 came into force)\n[13] The relevant sub-sections of the modif ed s 55 provide as follows:(1) Where a right, duty or liability would arise under a contract of sale of goods by implication of law, it may be negatived or varied by express agreement..., but the preceding provision has effect subject to the following provisions of this section.(4) In the case of a contract of sale of goods, any term of that or any other contract exempting from all or any of the provisions of s 13, 14 or 15 above is void in the case of a consumer sale and is, in any other case, not enforceable to the extent that it is shown that it would not be fair or reasonable to allow reliance on the term. Section 55, sub-ss (1), (4), (5) and (9) are set out.Students need to study s 55 carefully to ensure thatthey understand what it is providing for and that theycan follow the discussion of it by Lord Bridge. To assistthere follows an ‘aside’ dealing with understanding s 55. \n\n--- Page 278 ---\n     READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 247 (5) In determining for the purposes of sub-section (4) above whether or not \nreliance on any such term would be fair or reasonable regard shall be had to all the circumstances of the case and in particular to the following matters – (a) the strength of the bargaining positions of the seller and buyer relative to each other, taking into account, among other things, the availability of suitable alternative products and sources of supply; (b) whether the buyer received an inducement to agree to the term or in accepting it had an opportunity of buying the goods or suitable alternatives without it from any source of supply; (c) whether the buyer knew or ought reasonably to have known of the existence and extent of the term (having regard, among otherthings, to any previous course of dealing between the parties); (d) where the term exempts from all or any of the provisions of s 13, 14 or 15 above if any condition is not complied with, whether it was reasonable at the time of the contract to expect that compliance with that condition would be practicable; (e) whether the goods were manufactured, processed, or adapted to the special order of the buyer...(9) Any reference in this section to a term exempting from all or any of the provisions of any section of this Act is a reference to a term which purports to exclude or restrict, or has the effect of excluding or restricting, the operation of all or any of the provisions of that section, or the exercise of a right conferred by any provision of that section, or any liability of the seller for breach of a condition or warranty implied by any provision of that section.\nAn aside: a consideration for the statutory rule of the modif ed s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979This is an appropriate moment to look in more detail at s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. To understand properly the development of the reasoning of the court on the statutory issue, it is vital to get to grips with the basic layout, interconnections and effect of the provisions. Often, students do not pay suff cient attention to such matters and then wonder why they cannot understand discussions!The purely textual explanation is complicated and needs to be read in conjunction with the statutory provision. Two diagrams will follow: \n(Continued) \n\n--- Page 279 ---\n       \n \n 248 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nTABLE 8.1 (CONTINIUED) COMPARING VERBATIM TEXT OF LORD BRIDGE’S JUDGMENT IN GEORGE MITCHELL V \nFINNEY LOCK SEEDS  ILLUSTRATING ACCURATE SUMMARISING OF THE RANGE OF LEGAL ISSUES AND \nTHE ARGUMENT AS IT IS BUILT BY LORD BRIDGE \nPara Lord Bridge: Judgment (divided into numbered paragraphs). George \nMitchell ν Finney Lock Seeds 1983 2 AC 803: VERBATIM TEXT Summary of paragraph \n(1) Figure 8.17 sets out s 55 in its entirety. This enables the relationship between differing sub-sections and paragraphs to be seen. It will be \nannotated.(2) Figure 8.18 is a précis  version of s 55, identifying the most relevant sections according to the facts of the case. The f gure indicates whether the \nrelevant section applies to this case, does not apply or whether it is unknown whether it applies.Section 55 is highly complex and you should consider it in detail before we return to the rest of Table 8.1 and the judge’s deliberation. It is often helpful for readers to stop and check their understanding, or to check their view against that of the judge. This ref ection begins the process of evaluation. Please carefully study both diagrams and understand them.Hopefully you now have a clearer picture of s 55. Often, students continue reading text when it is clear to them that they do not understand what they are reading. You should never go on reading when you know that you do not understand what you are reading. You should instead stop and return to that last point in the text when you did understand and re-read – slowly and carefully until you do understand, or at least have a partial understanding that stands a chance of growing as you read on. It may be helpful to try to create a diagram like Figure 8.18 to help you to understand.In texts discussing complex issues, tiny connectors, if missed, rob the reader of understanding. A paragraph by paragraph reconsideration will often \nrestore comprehension.\nWe can now return to the paragraph by paragraph summary where Lord Bridge is about to discuss s 55.\n[14] The contract between the appellants and the respondents was not a ‘consumer’ sale’, as def ned for the purpose of these provisions. The effect of cl 3 of the relevant condition is to exclude, inter alia , the terms implied by \nss 13 and 14 of the Act that the seeds sold by description should correspond to the description and be of merchantable quality and to substitute therefore the express but limited obligations undertaken by the appellants under ell 1 and 2. The statutory issue, therefore, turns on the words in s 55(4) ‘to the extent that it is shown that it would not be fair or reasonable to allow’ reliance on this restriction of the appellants’ liabilities, having regard to the matters referred to in sub-s (5) Lord Bridge observes that the contract in question is not a consumer contract but ‘any other contract’: This information is obtained by a careful reading of s 55(4) plus knowledge of what a consumer sale is; look back at Figure 8.17 and re-read s 55(4). This contract is not a consumer contract and therefore falls under the second heading in s 55(4).Lord Bridge further observes that cl 3 of the relevant condition exempts the seller from liability for breach of ss 13 and 14 of the Sale of Goods Act. \n\n--- Page 280 ---\n      \n \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 249 • This is a good example of the need to have an active \ndialogue with the text. Clause 3 is the third sentence of \nthe relevant condition and the relevant condition is the condition limiting liability.\n• How is this known? Because in paragraph 2 of his opinion \nLord Bridge states (see précis  above): issues arise from \nthree sentences in the conditions of sale. These are set out and identif ed. He states he will call this the relevant condition, and will call each sentence a clause, so ell 1, 2, 3. Lord Bridge goes on to say that ss 13 and 14 provide that: items sold by description should correspond to the description; items sold should be of merchantable quality, and that ell 1 and 2 substitute for the full protection of the legislation the limited obligation to replace seedsor refund price of seeds. Lord Bridge sums up that the statutory issue depends on whether ell 1 and 2 are ‘fair and reasonable’ according to the criteria as set out in s 55(4) and (5). \n[15] This is the f rst time your Lordships’ House has had to consider a modern statutory provision giving the court power to override contractual terms excluding or restricting liability, which depends on the court’s view of what is ‘fair and reasonable’. The particular provision of the modif ed s 55 of the 1979 Act, which applies in the instant case is of limited and diminishing importance. But the several provisions of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, which depend on ‘the requirement of reasonableness’, def ned in s 11 by reference to what is ‘fair and reasonable’, albeit in a different context, are likely to come before the courts with increasing frequency. It may, therefore, be appropriate to consider how an original decision what is ‘fair and reasonable’ made in the application of any of these provisions should be approached by an appellate court. It would not be accurate to describe such a decision as an exercise of discretion. But a decision under any of the provisions referred to will have this in common with the exercise of a discretion, that, in having regard to the various matters to which the modif ed s 55(5) of the 1979 Act, or s 11 of the 1977 Act direct attention, the court must entertain a whole range of considerations, put there in the scales on one This is the f rst time that the court has considered the statutory power to interfere with the limiting or excluding liability that has been agreed between the parties at common law. This is a far-reaching power to interfere with the freedom of individuals to contract. The court can say ‘no’, you cannot freely agree this, because, in our opinion, it is not fair and reasonable. The actual decision in this case specif cally regarding s 55 is of limited importance (as we are told s 55 is protecting the contracts made between 18 May 1973 and 1 February 1978) and, as such, would soon outlive its usefulness. He discusses the fact that the exercise of any power to decide what is fair or reasonable will involve legitimate judicial differences and that the courts shouldrefrain from interfering with the decision of the previous court unless they feel that there was a clearly wrong decision or that the case was decided on some clearly erroneous principle. \n(Continued) \n\n--- Page 281 ---\n    \n    \n \n 250 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nTABLE 8.1 (CONTINIUED) COMPARING VERBATIM TEXT OF LORD BRIDGE’S JUDGMENT IN GEORGE MITCHELL V \nFINNEY LOCK SEEDS  ILLUSTRATING ACCURATE SUMMARISING OF THE RANGE OF LEGAL ISSUES AND \nTHE ARGUMENT AS IT IS BUILT BY LORD BRIDGE \nPara Lord Bridge: Judgment (divided into numbered paragraphs). George \nMitchell ν Finney Lock Seeds 1983 2 AC 803: VERBATIM TEXT Summary of paragraph \nside or the other and decide at the end of the day on which side the balance \ncomes down. There will sometimes be room for a legitimate difference of judicial opinion as to what the answer should be, where it will be impossible to say that one view is demonstrably wrong and the other demonstrably right. It must follow, in my view, that, when asked to review such a decision on appeal, the appellate court should treat the original decision with the utmost respect and refrain from interference with it unless satisf ed that it proceeded \non some erroneous principle or was plainly and obviously wrong. \n[16] Turning back to the modif ed s 55 of the 1979 Act, it is common ground that the onus was on the respondents to show that it would not be fair or reasonable to allow the appellants to rely on the relevant condition as limiting their liability. It was argued for the appellants that the court must have regard to the circumstances as at the date of the contract, not after the breach. The basis of the argument was that this was the effect of s 11 of the 1977 Act and that it would be wrong to construe the modif ed s 55 of the Act as having a different effect. Assuming the premise is correct, the conclusion does not follow. The provisions of the 1977 Act cannot be considered in construing the prior enactments now embodied in the modif ed s 55 of the 1979 Act. But, in any event, the language of sub-ss (4) and (9) of that section is clear and \nunambiguous. The question whether it is fair or reasonable to allow reliance\non a term excluding or limiting liability for breach of contract can only arise after the breach. The nature of the breach and the circumstances in which it occurred cannot possibly be excluded from ‘all the circumstances of the case’ to which regard must be had. Lord Bridge turns to a question of construction, the meaning of words used in the statute. The onus is on the respondents to show that it would not be fair or reasonable to allow the appellant to rely on the relevant condition. Appellants said the court must look at the situation at the date of the contract, but Lord Bridge said that the true meaning of the phrase in s 55(5) ‘regard shall be had to all the circumstances of the case’ must mean that the situation at the time of the breach and  after the breach must be taken into account. \n\n--- Page 282 ---\n      READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 251 [17] The only other question of construction debated in the course of the \nargument was the meaning to be attached to the words ‘to the extent that’ in sub-section (4) and, in particular, whether they permit the court to hold that it would be fair and reasonable to allow partial reliance on a limitation clause and, for example, to decide in the instant case that the respondents should recover, say, half their consequential damage. I incline to the view that, in their context, the words are equivalent to ‘in so far as’ or ‘in circumstances in which’ and do not permit the kind of judgment of Solomon illustrated by the example. Lord Bridge discusses another issue of the meaning of words used in the statute. The meaning of the words ‘to the extent’ in s 55(4). Lord Bridge asks: ‘Is it fair and reasonable to allow partial reliance on a limitation clause, to decide... that the respondents should recover say, half their consequential damage?’Lord Bridge goes on to say that he considers that the meaning of the phrase ‘to the extent’ is ‘in so far as or in circumstances in which’. He suggests that the phrase does not ‘permit the kind of judgment of Solomon illustrated by the example’. The reference to Solomon is typical of the literary/religious referencing that one often f nds in cases. Solomon was an Old Testament king accredited with much wisdom in his judging. When confronted with a baby claimed by two mothers he suggested cutting it in half so each could have half. The false mother agreed, the real mother said no, the other mother could have the baby. Thus, he located the real mother. \n[18] \nBut for the purpose of deciding this appeal I f nd it unnecessary to express a \nconcluded view on this question. Lord Bridge goes on to say that his answer in relation to the question is not necessary for the outcome of this case and declines to answer one way or the other! It is interesting to note that if he had  categorically answered the question, \nyes or no, it would be a clear example of an obiter dictumstatement in a strong case by a senior judge and may well have been used in argument in a later case where this issue is at the core of the case.\n[19] My Lords, at long last I turn to the application of the statutory language to the circumstances of the case. Of the particular matters to which attention is directed by paras (a) to (e) of s 55(5) only those in paras (a) to (c) are relevant. As to para (c), the respondents admittedly knew of the relevant condition (they had dealt with the appellants for many years) and, if they had read it, particularly cl 2, they would, I think, as laymen rather than lawyers, have had no diff culty in understanding what it said. This and the magnitude of the damages claimed in proportion to the price of the seeds sold are factors which weigh in the scales in the appellants’ favour. Eventually, Lord Bridge turns to the ‘application of the statutory language’ to the case. He states that only s 55(5) (a) and (c) are relevant. (This is the moment to re-read s 55(5) (a) and (c) above if you do not remember the provisions. Otherwise, one loses sight of the argument!)As to s 55(5) (c), he says of course the buyer knew of the condition as it was standard throughout the trade. \n(Continued) \n\n--- Page 283 ---\n        \n \n 252 \nTABLE 8.1 (CONTINIUED) COMPARING VERBATIM TEXT OF LORD BRIDGE’S JUDGMENT IN GEORGE MITCHELL V \nFINNEY LOCK SEEDS  ILLUSTRATING ACCURATE SUMMARISING OF THE RANGE OF LEGAL ISSUES AND \nTHE ARGUMENT AS IT IS BUILT BY LORD BRIDGE READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nPara Lord Bridge: Judgment (divided into numbered paragraphs). George \nMitchell ν Finney Lock Seeds 1983 2 AC 803: VERBATIM TEXT Summary of paragraph \n[20] The question of relative bargaining strength under para (a) and of the \nopportunity to buy seeds without a limitation of the seedsman’s liability under para (b) were interrelated. The evidence was that a similar limitation of liability was universally embodied in the terms of trade between seedsmen and farmers and had been so for very many years. The limitation had never been negotiated between representative bodies but, on the other hand, had not been the subject of any protest by the National Farmers’ Union. These factors, if considered in isolation, might have been equivocal. The decisive factor, however, appears from the evidence of four witnesses called for the appellants, independent seedsmen, the chairman of the appellant company, and a director of a sister company (both being wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same parent). They said that it had always been their practice, unsuccessfully attempted in the instant case, to negotiate settlements of farmers’ claims for damages in excess of the price of the seeds, if they thought that the claims were ‘genuine’ and ‘justif ed’. This evidence indicated a clear recognition by seedsmen in general, and the appellants in particular, that reliance on the limitation of liability imposed by the relevant condition would not be fair or reasonable. As to s 55(5) (a), he states that there was evidence that similar limitations had never been negotiated with representativebodies. Witnesses for the appellant said that it had always been their practice in genuine justif ed claims to settle above the price of the seeds but that, in this case, settlement had not been possible. Lord Bridge said, ‘this evidence indicated a clear recognition … that reliance on the limitation of liability imposed by the relevant condition would not be fair or reasonable’. \n[21] Two further factors, if more were needed, weigh the scales in favour of the respondent. The supply of autumn instead of winter cabbage seed was due to the negligence of the appellants’ sister company. Irrespective of its quality, the autumn variety supplied could not, according to the appellants’ own evidence, be grown commercially in East Lothian. Finally, as the trial judge found, seedsmen could insure against the risk of crop failure caused by supply of the wrong variety of seeds without materially increasing the price of seeds. Lord Bridge concluded, therefore, that the wrong seed was supplied due to the negligence of the applicant’s sister company. Seedsmen could insure against the risk of crop failure caused by the wrong supply without materially increasing the cost of seeds. \n[22] My Lords, even if one felt doubts about the statutory issue, one should not, for the reasons explained earlier, think it right to interfere with the unanimous original decision of that issue by the Court of Appeal. As it is, I feel no such doubts. If one were making the original decision, one should conclude without hesitation that it would not be fair or reasonable to allow the appellants to rely on the contractual limitation of their liability. One would dismiss the appeal. Lord Bridge felt no doubts about the decision of the Court of Appeal over statute.Lord Bridge refers to an earlier point in para 15 that it is wise to ‘refrain from interference’ in matters of legitimate judicial difference. \n\n--- Page 284 ---\n     \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 253 \nIdentifying the function of individual paragraphs and clusters of paragraphs is one \nway to organise a text in terms of its arguments and its proofs. Paragraphs build an argument by laying out propositions and evidence (proofs). This will help you to iden -\ntify the arguments and see how the text builds up to a fnal decision. \n(4) Summarise only the essential detail of each paragraph. If you do not understand what the paragraph is saying, remember the strategy of looking at paragraphs above as well as immediately below to search for understanding and sense. \nCheck each of your paragraph summaries against those provided in Table 8 .1, asking \nyourself whether: \n  your summary contains all  of the same information; \n  you missed anything; \n  the summary paragraphs in Table 8 .1 are easier to understand and, if so, consider \nwhy this might be. \nA quick review of the paragraph summaries in Table 8 .1 begins to reveal the patterns in \nthe argument that Lord Bridge is constructing. Re-reading the paragraphs while looking \nat the statutory diagrams in Figures 8 .17 and 8.18  (in Table 8 .1) allows the argument to \nbe reviewed whilst looking at the entire provision in s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. \nThe paragraph approach has also isolated the common law issue and the statutory \nissue. Reviewing Figure 8 .12 above, dealing with the facts, issues and procedural history \nenables you to appreciate the differences between the reasoning in the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords, even though both courts reached the same decision. \nAt this stage, it should be possible to identify the precise rationale behind the court’s \nview of the common law issue and the statutory issue. It should also be possible to pin -\npoint precisely the statutory areas of relevance and how the court dealt with the issue. Figure 8 .19 provides a summary of this information in diagrammatic form. \nAs your profciency in reading cases develops, you may fnd you are able to move \nstraight to a diagrammatic representation, although, ultimately, a brief conventional tex -\ntual note should be made to supplement the diagram. \nConstructing a usable case note \nOne of the most important skills in the toolkit of a law student or legal professional is the ability to read a case and make a usable record of it. This is called a ‘case note’. The purpose of a case note is to record, in a quick and accessible form, all of the important issues for the later use of the case (for example, deciding whether to apply the case to the facts of another legal problem). Ideally the case note will contain all necessary specifc information and reasoning to allow its author to use it in subsequent problem scenarios for solving legal problem questions. \nA case note can only be made once you have read and re-read the case under con -\nsideration and obtained a thorough understanding of the case and the interrelationships between the legal rules discussed, the facts of the case, and the reasoning of the court. You have certainly done this in relation to the George Mitchell  case. \n\n--- Page 285 ---\n    \n  254 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nFigure 8.17 Layout of the modifed s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 \n\n--- Page 286 ---\n       READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 255 \nFigure 8.18 Revised diagram of Section 55 \n\n--- Page 287 ---\n256 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES  \nFigure 8.19  Summary: court’s rationale for decision \n\n--- Page 288 ---\n     \n  \n \n READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 257 \nTABLE 8.2 INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR A CASE NOTE \n1.

A case note that only records the judicial reasoning and not the facts cannot be applied because the very idea of ‘similarity’ rests upon similar facts as well as similar legal rules. \nBy the time a case reaches the appellate court the dispute will be quite narrow and in \nmany ways may be very different from the dispute on the facts between the parties in the previous trial or appellate court. For example, in a discrimination case the original argu -\nment between the parties may concern the discrimination against one party by the other in their workplace, contrary to the Equality Act 2010. The point on appeal could, however, be concerned simply with the appropriate meaning of a word or a phrase in a section, sub-section, paragraph or sub-paragraph of the legislation. This demonstrates why it is essential to have information on facts, rules, issues and grounds of appeal, and reason for the outcome of the case. Several important cases under the Equality Act 2010 have turned on the meaning of the word ‘can’. You can only properly use your case note in legal argument when you know and understand the reasoning of the court and are able to state \n\n--- Page 289 ---\n    \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 258 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nbriefy, but correctly in your note together with the relevant facts, the legal issues before \nthe court and the applicable legal rules considered. \nActivity: writing a usable case note \n(1) Using the list in Table 8 .2 as headings write a case note of the case of George Mitchell v \nFinney Lock Seeds  [1983] 2 AC 803.

The role of the judici -\nary in the development of English law has become apparent as the chapter has progressed and the doctrine of precedent has been laid out. This chapter has also indicated the central importance of a careful dissection of the law reports to ensure that the correct aspects of the case are correctly summarised for a case note and further use. It must be understood in relation to domestic legislation and European law as together they lay a frm, indispen -\nsable foundation for understanding ‘how to’ handle and understand legal rules, and how to understand the relationship between case law, legislation and European Union law. \nThe major case study in this chapter, George Mitchell v Finney Lock Seeds  is important for \na demonstration of reading and handling case law and understanding judge-made common law rules and their relationship to judge-made equitable legal rules. But it is also important because it is a case that is concerned with the relationship of judge-made law to statutory rules; for the senior judiciary are the fnal interpreters of the meaning, extent and limits of domestic legislation. This issue is explored in greater detail towards the end of Chapter 7 . \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  The doctrine of precedent means English judges, when deciding cases in court, must refer to similar prior decisions of the higher courts, and keep to the reasoning in those cases. \n\n--- Page 290 ---\n     \n  \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 259 \n  Much depends on the defnition of the word ‘similar’, and this is determined by the \njudges in the court. \n  Locating the ratio  or principle of a case can be diffcult and there may be dissenting \nviews among the judges hearing the trial or the appeal. \n  The practice of the doctrine of precedent in the English legal system requires a sys -\ntem of accurate reporting of legal cases. \n  Law reports are reports of important cases (e.g. cases where the judge has extracted a ‘new’ legal rule and/or cases involving statutory interpretation). \n  A paragraph by paragraph reading approach is the best way to gain an in-depth understanding of the law report of a case. \n  A case note must include date of hearing, citation, court, procedural history, the facts of the case, the legal issues before the court, legal rules discussed, the judicial rea -\nsoning of each judge for the decision reached and the outcome between the parties. \nACTIVITY: WRITING A USABLE CASE NOTE  \nQUESTION 1 \nSpecimen case note of George Mitchell v Finney Lock Seeds \nCITATION:  [1983] 2 AC 803 COURT:  House of Lords \nJUDGES:  LJJ: Diplock, Scarman, Roskill, Brightman, Bridge \nDATE:  23, 24 May, 30 June \nFACTS The respondents (George Mitchell) purchased 30lb seeds from the appellants for £201.60 in \nDecember 1973. The invoice contained a standard limitation clause stating that the only liability of the appellants for breach of contract by them was replacement of the seeds or a refund of the cost of the seeds. All other liability was excluded. The respondent’s crop failed because the wrong seed and seed of an inferior quality had been delivered due to the negligence of the appellant’s sister company. This caused them excessive damage that could not be covered by the cost of replacement seed. \nThe appellants argued that the standard limitation clause applied and is not negated by \nnegligence, and furthermore that it was unaffected by s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act. \nThe respondents argued that the reverse maintaining the limitation clause was unenforceable. The House of Lords held: \n(1) The common law condition was not negated by negligence, agreeing with the minority argu -\nment of Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal. \n(2) However, it was not a fair and reasonable limitation clause and was therefore rendered \nunenforceable by s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. \nCases referred to: Ailsa Craig Fishing Co Ltd v Malvern Fishing Co Ltd [1983] 1 H WLR 964; [1983] 1 All ER 101, HL (Sc). \n\n--- Page 291 ---\n    \n  \n  260 READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES \nCanada Steamship Lines Ltd v The King [1952] AC 192; [1952] 1 All ER 305, PC \nConsidered Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd [1980] AC 827; [1980] 2 WLR 283; [1980] 1 All ER 556, HL(E). \nApplied \nStatutory rules referred to Sale of Goods Act 1979, s 55 (4) (5). Procedural history Trial The plaintiffs (George Mitchell) claimed damages and argued that the standard common law \non the limitation clause did not apply because it was not a fair and reasonable requirement imposed on limitation clauses by s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. \nThe defendants (Finney Lock Seeds) argued that the limitation clause was valid. Parker J held: The limitation clause was not operative at common law because of the \ndefendant’s negligence in delivering the wrong seed. \nCourt of Appeal: Denning, Kerr, Oliver LJJ The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal on the grounds that the limitation clause \nwas valid. The plaintiffs, now the respondents, argued the limitation clause was invalid due to negligence and if it was not invalid due to negligence it was unenforceable due to the operation of s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. \nKerr and Oliver LJJ held that the limitation clause could not be relied upon because: \n(1) on its true construction the condition did not apply at common law because of loss due to \nthe negligence of the sister company, and the seed was wholly different than delivery of the \nwrong seed (Kerr and Oliver LJJ). Therefore the condition did not apply due to negligence, but they also applied s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, holding that the clause was not fair and reasonable. ( Note : having said the clause did not apply at common law because of \nnegligence, s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act was irrelevant as it is only operative if the clause is deemed to apply at common law!) \n(2) Denning LJ  held, in the minority, that the limitation clause could apply at common law. \nHowever, it was not enforceable because it was not a fair and reasonable clause under s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979. \nHouse of Lords \nThe appellants (Finney Lock Seeds) appealed to the House of Lords. Held: Lord Diplock:  He made clear that he agreed with the minority reasoning of Lord \nDenning in the Court of Appeal. He notes that he has read and agrees completely with the reasoning of Lord Bridge in this case in the House of Lords which dismisses this appeal following Lord Denning’s reasoning. Scarman, Roskill, Brightman LJJ:  note their agreement with the reasoning of \nLord Bridge which was the majority judgment in the case. Lord Bridge \n\n--- Page 292 ---\n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  READING AND UNDERSTANDING CASES 261 \nHe agreed with the reasoning of Denning LJ in the Court of Appeal on: \n(1) The common law issue \nThat the limitation clause was operative and could effectively limit liability. The wording of the \ncondition was unambiguous in this regard. Limitation clauses do not have to adhere to the strict principles laid down for complete exclusion clauses (see Ailsa Craig (1983), which are negated by negligence). These must be clearly expressed and must be strictly interpreted against the party relying on them ( contra proferentem ). The limitation clause does not have to be so strictly \ninterpreted and was still capable of enforcement. \nDecision partly supported by the following precedents Photo Production Ltd (1980) Even in cases of fundamental breach, (core) limitation clauses are available to be relied upon by \none party. Ailsa Craig (1983). There is a difference of approach appropriate between limitation and exclusion clauses. Limitation clauses do not have to be so strictly interpreted. \nHe also agreed with Lord Denning on the matter of: \n(2) The statutory issue \nHowever, even though the clause was enforceable at common law, after considering s 55(4), (5) \n(a) and (c), Lord Bridge decided that the common law provision was overridden by the statutory obligation in s 55(4) for such clauses to be fair and reasonable otherwise. The clause was therefore unenforceable. \nThe grounds for deciding clause unfair and unreasonable were that: \n(a) in applying s 55(5) (a), it was clear that in the past appellants had sought to negotiate a set -\ntlement that was higher than the price of seeds and had not relied on the limitation clause; \n(b) the supply of seed was due to the negligence of the appellant’s sister company; \n(c) the appellant could easily have insured against loss due to negligence. \nRatio Common law limitation clauses are not negated by negligence; however, s 55 of the Sale of \nGoods Act requires such clauses to be fair and reasonable. \nObiter dicta \n(a) The phrase ‘to the extent that’ discussed and said to mean ‘in so far as’ or ‘in the circum -\nstances which’. Section 54(4). Although this is not relevant to this case it is possibly an \nimportant obiter dictum. \n(b) There may be some mileage in discussions concerning whether there can be partial reliance \non limitation clauses again. Although this is not relevant to this case, possible important obiter dicta. \n(c) The phrase ‘in all the circumstances’ in s 55(5) means one should take account of circum -\nstances at and after the time of the breach. \n(d) Appellate courts in a case like this, where there is room for legitimate judicial difference, \nshould refrain from interfering unless it is considered that the decision reached was based on the application of wrong principles or the case is clearly wrongly decided. \nOutcome:  Appeal dismissed. \nPrecedent value: This is always determined after the case during the reasoning in a similar case; however, the prediction would be that due to the unanimity in the House of Lords this is a majority judgment and therefore creates a strong binding precedent. \n\n--- Page 294 ---\n \n PART 3 \nAPPLYING YOUR \nRESEARCH \nThis section of the book is concerned with your competency in identifying, constructing, \nand critiquing arguments, and your competent performance in written and oral assess -\nment. The ability to construct an argument is a key skill in all disciplines and many profes -\nsions. The lawyer is not just able to use words skillfully; the lawyer also has the ability to develop and put forward skilled arguments. Your ability to do so whilst studying for your law degree will improve your performance in assessments. \nChapter 9 ‘Constructing an argument’ introduces the general characteristics and \nstructure of arguments, and the basic building blocks of argument (propositions, evi -\ndence, conclusions). It also explores inductive and deductive forms of arguments. Once students have understood the basics they can go on learning about the nature of argu -\nments throughout their academic, vocational and professional lives. The chapter also spends time considering the nature of rules and problems. This consideration is neces -\nsary; law students spend much of their time identifying problems and applying rules to resolve problems. Therefore, it is important to understand something about their intrinsic character. \nCompetent performance in written and oral assessment throughout the degree pro -\ngramme, including your effcient revision and execution of examinations are key to your success as a law student. Assessment and examinations test the whole range of your skills as they are performed by you in a series of one-off events throughout the years of your degree. The other chapters in this part address the most commonly employed assessment strategies currently used by law schools on the law degree. \nThe quality of your language and your argument construction skills become essential \nas these are the vehicles that carry your legal work regardless of whether the assess -\nment is written or oral. Your legal research skills allow you to locate the range of sources required for your work, but your skill in summarising, evaluating and critiquing those retrieved sources, and the demonstration of your critical thinking powers, are equally important. Your ability to comfortably use legal and academic as well as occasional legal professional resources will also be evaluated in assessments and examinations. \nLaw degrees are primarily assessed through written work. You may be asked to write a \nreport or an essay or provide a solution to a legal problem. Chapters 10 and 11 exclusively consider effective law essay writing and answering legal problem questions. The majority \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-11  \n\n--- Page 295 ---\n   264 APPLYING YOUR RESEARCH \nof law schools continuously assess students through the year as well as in set examina -\ntions which are invariably timed written events.\nLaw schools are increasingly assessing general oral skills through presentations, \nand specialist legal skills through mooting, negotiation and mediation exercises. Oral \npresentations are the skills competencies required to perform well in these types of assessments; these are considered in Chapter 12 and strategies for approaching written examinations are addressed in Chapter 13.\nAll assessments test the developmental state of all of your skills and they must \nalways be approached in a careful and timely manner and most importantly for you, they also determine your degree classification.\n1 Taken together therefore, chapters in this \npart introduce you to reasoning techniques that are core to the enterprise of legal study and the competencies required to display your arguments in a variety of assessments. If you take the time to read them, and complete guided exercises where provided, you will be rewarded with an increase in your competency to construct arguments which in turn will broaden your understanding of law.\n1 I n some law schools year 1 does not count towards your degree classification, it is a qualifier. In some law \nschools, however, it may count.\n\n--- Page 296 ---\n9 \n  \n          \n CONSTRUCTING \nAN ARGUMENT \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Defne ‘argument’ and explain its general characteristics. \n  Distinguish between inductive and deductive argument. \n  Appreciate the importance of analogous reasoning in the English legal system. \n  Appreciate the process of argument construction and the skills required to complete \nthem effectively. \n  Understand the relationship between the diagnosis of problems and the construction of rules to solve problems. \n  Understand the relationship between facts, evidence and legal rules. \n  Appreciate the limitations of logical reasoning and the necessity of legal judgments. \n  Defne and differentiate between inductive, deductive and abductive reasoning. \n  Be aware of the need to develop critical thinking. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-12  \n\n--- Page 297 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n 266 CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT \nINTRODUCTION \nEveryone argues at many points in their everyday life, with family, friends, employers, \nwork colleagues, fellow students and teachers. The tools used for arguments like this are usually not precise and are often driven by emotional responses to other people’s behav -\niour, such as anger, frustration, anxiety, and even love. Despite their seriousness in terms of the potential consequences to relationships and status, these arguments are informal and non-academic. Arguments in universities and in the courtroom or negotiator’s offce need to be structured and constructed more formally. \nAs a law student, arguments are central to everything you do. As we will discuss later \nin the book, a good essay, a good presentation and even a good exam answer is a con -\nvincing argument, trying to convince your audience (even if it only consists of the lecturer marking it) of your carefully developed standpoint. \nThis chapter introduces the concept of formal, academic argument, and outlines the \nbasic characteristics of argument and argumentative terms in order to enhance your abil -\nity to use properly the legal and academic source material that you will research for semi -\nnar work, assessments and exams. \nThis chapter considers the defnition of argument, and the general characteristics \nof an argument. It will also look at three types of argument necessary for success in law; inductive, deductive and analogic argument, and considers the relationship between facts, evidence and legal rules in the construction of legal argument. The chapter also explores the important relationships between problem diagnosis, devel -\nopment of rules to resolve the problem and subsequent application of those rules to similar situations. \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to understand and develop the skills \nrequired to identify, construct and attack an argument. \nTime is spent at the beginning of the chapter looking at the relationship between diag -\nnosis of problems and the construction of rules to solve problems. If you wrongly diag -\nnose a problem, no solutions will work! \nWhat is an argument? \nFormal and informal arguments all comprise a range of assertions and counter asser -\ntions that lead to a resolution of the argument to the satisfaction of one of the parties, if not both. It is useful to remember that ‘to argue’ is a verb and therefore ‘argument’ is an action. There are always two sides to an argument even if one side seems passive. \nThe word ‘argument’ has a range of meanings, all of which revolve around proving the \nvalidity of an assertion. In this book we will use the following defnition of argument: \nAn argument is a series of statements, some backed by evidence, some not, which are purposely presented in order to prove, or disprove, a given position . \n\n--- Page 298 ---\n    \n \n   267 CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT \nLATIN RO OT -ARGUMENTUM FRENCH RO OT -ARGUMENT \nARGUMENT \nENGLISH USAG E \nMeaning v aries accor ding to cont ext \n6 2 4 1 3 5 \nThe bringing of \nproofs to support A stat ement or a \nfact br ought in \norder to infuence \nothers  in the \nview s A statem ent of pros \nand cons of a give n \nIn both astrono my and A series of statem ents The summary of \nthat are purposely \n'argument' refers to the designed to pr ove or the theme of a \narc, angle on which the \nFigure 9.1 Different meanings of the word ‘argument’ as used in English \nFigure 9 .1 demonstrates that law is not alone in having argument as a core activity. It \nshows how various academic disciplines use the English meaning of argue, each with \nslightly differing connotations but all coming under the main idea of argument, as support -\ning or denying propositions or maintaining that something is the case by bringing reasons. \n\n--- Page 299 ---\n   \n  \n      \n \n \n 268 CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT \nOur preferred defnition of argument refers to supporting ‘a given position’. Such ‘given \nposition’ in a legal context could be: \n(1) Anna is guilty of theft contrary to the Theft Act 1968. \n(2) Anna is not guilty of theft contrary to the Theft Act 1968. \n(3) The European Union is not democratic. \n(4) The European Union is democratic. \nNote that the given positions expressed as statements in (1) and (2) are different to those in (3) and (4). Whilst (3) and (4) could be the subject of a theoretical essay, or the topic of a debate, (1) and (2) are assertions that require the consideration of legal rules and facts to determine innocence or guilt, as in a court case. However, good arguments for all four positions would share similar structures and characteristics, and we will return to these positions later in the chapter. \nDeveloping your skills of argument \nArgument is both a process and an activity. To engage in the process of argument is to deploy methodically a series of arguments. \nAn argument can be viewed as a journey from problem to solution, or from an allega -\ntion to a conclusion denying or supporting that allegation. In the case of legal problems, this journey consists of interpretation and application of legal rules to legal problems. This journey cannot be undertaken without preparation and if the preparation is not properly carried out then the destination may not be reached. Many students hate the prepara -\ntion and the journey but the challenges involved in argument construction will help refne your study, research, legal and language skills. If the preparation and the journey can be enjoyed, and not just endured, then the road is set for successful lifelong learning leading to good results. \nThe journey from problem to solution requires a map: a map others can follow, a map \nthat allows the argument-crafter to take readers, or listeners, along with them to the desired destination. A map that eloquently explains why it is not a good idea to take this side-road or that alternative route, a map that also explains how, if matters were different, another route could have been taken. To create a good map, you need a good balance of skills, as illustrated in Figure 9 .2. \nAn argument will only be as good as the ability of the person constructing it, to use \nthis range of skills they have developed. As each skill develops so will the quality of your argument identifcation and construction, \nLegal arguments take place through the mediating infuence of oral and written lan -\nguage. As you will discover, language is a notoriously fexible and subjective medium of communication. Language and its interpretation mould the law and determine outcomes. \n\n--- Page 300 ---\n    \n  CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT 269 \nRange of skills to be u\u0010lised for good \nargument construc\u0010on \nCompetent \niden\u0010fca\u0010on of \nnature of the \nproblem Competent loca\u0010on of \npoten\u0010ally relevant: \nLegal rules \nSecondary texts Competent re-\nevalua\u0010on of problems \nand solu\u0010ons Refec\u0010on as to \nconclusion \nCri\u0010cal thinking \nCompetent reading, \nsummarising and \nevalua\u0010on of \nrelevant texts The dra‘ing of poten\u0010al \nsolu\u0010ons \nFigure 9.2 Skills required for good argument construction \nCritical thinking \nKey to successful argumentation is the ability to engage in critical thinking. One important \ncharacteristic of highly competent people is that in many areas of their lives they have developed a critical approach to what they do, see and think. Not critical in the sense of being negative and trying to fnd faults, but critical in the sense of exercising judgments based upon careful observation, investigation and consideration of the issues relevant to the matter about which a judgment is to be made. \nMost educators and senior managers would state that critical thinking, critical analysis \nand critical refection are essential skills sought after in students and employees. Usually, these phrases are not defned but are left as vague attributes. However, the skills involved are not vague, for they are identifed by others looking for them. Some people defne criti -\ncal thinking as a cluster of skills, which includes: \n  reasoning logically; \n  the ability to locate underlying assumptions; \n  analytic and argumentative skills. \n\n--- Page 301 ---\n   \n 270 CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT \nIn terms of approaches to study, it can mean the ability to be: \n  curious; \n  fexible; \n  sceptical. \nCritical thinking is usually thought of as an academic or intellectual skill, but it also has \ncrucial practical applications in life. What should be clear is that it is not just a cerebral rational attribute and act. Critical thinking is equally informed by passion, emotion and imagination. Imagination can in fact be essential to leaps of creativity that are later identi -\nfed as ‘critical’. Being a critical thinker therefore is bigger than just cognitive acts of logi -\ncal reasoning, and the careful consideration of argument. It also involves an ability to fnd assumptions behind beliefs, actions and behaviour, and bring creativity to the activity of thinking. Critical thinking involves the whole person and can be seen as a life-enhancing necessity. \nThe ability to think critically is crucial to understanding our personal relationships, \nenvisioning alternative and more productive ways of organising the workplace, and becoming politically literate.\n1 \nCritical thinkers will be able to put forward justifcation for their ideas and actions \nand those of others. They can compare and contrast work through processes, subject justifcations to a number of interpretations and predict and test the accuracy of those predictions. They can work artifcially by constructing models of the ‘real’ and recognise that is what has been constructed. Critical thinking also involves ‘refection’, subjecting your learning to analysis by comparing it with practice. \nCritical thinkers are always searching for the hidden assumptions behind what oth -\ners just call ‘common sense’, or ‘everyday’ accepted ways of acting or thinking. They are aware of diversity in values and behaviour. When critical thinkers locate underlying assumptions they know they have to ask if they ft in with current notions of social reality. These assumptions are carefully dissected and their accuracy, as well as their validity, questioned. At this point these competent individuals consider alternative ways of acting and alternative assumptions to back them. Sentences like ‘this is just the way things are’ or ‘we have always done it this way’ are not acceptable to a critical thinker. \nFor critical thinkers nothing is closed, fxed or certain. Everything is potentially fex -\nible, open and possible. They are always questioning what lies behind the ideas, beliefs or actions that people hold or take. This is not to say that critical thinkers hold no strong views or cannot believe in anything. It is possible to hold the strongest convictions that something is right while accepting that all values, views and beliefs are open to question and that there may be alternative views. Critical thinkers can always imagine another plausible story, explanation, or value. They are not going to believe in universal truths without thorough investigation and indeed will probably always remain healthily sceptical of universal views, truths and explanations. \nIf a critical thinker holds a clear view, it is held lightly with scepticism. If strong evi -\ndence to the contrary occurs the view will be reconsidered. As Cottrell notes: \n1 S Brookfeld Developing Critical Thinkers: Challenging Adults to Explore Alternative Ways of Thinking and \nActing  (Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, CA, 1987), 14. \n\n--- Page 302 ---\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT 271 \nScepticism in critical thinking means bringing an element of polite doubt. In this context, scepticism does not mean you must go through life never believing any -\nthing you hear and see. This would not be helpful. It does mean holding open the possibility that what you know at the given time may be only part of the picture.\n2 \nCritical thinkers are fexible thinkers, but not fckle thinkers, and they are not afraid of alternatives. Constant questioning heightens the awareness of critical thinkers, as they always approach givens as if the view could be otherwise. \nThis takes us a long way beyond the discipline of law, legal method and studying law, \nbut the intellectual process involved in critical thinking is the basis of studying. Each discipline may require slightly differing approaches that accord to its accepted prac -\ntices and procedures, but the foundational importance of critical thinking remains intact within every part of the academic community. Each discipline will have developed its own beliefs, practices and procedures, its own theory and methods and its own underlying assumptions. The study of law is no exception. \nCompetency in critical thinking develops over time and no doubt all readers of this \nbook will have developed some critical thinking skills outside the study of law, although they may not have put a name to the process. This development can be transferred to your legal studies even if you have never really considered the issue of critical thinking before. In academic studies, critical thinking and a healthy scepticism of universality are demonstrated by approaches to reasoning. Critical thinkers, for example, are aware that often arguments contain contradictions and that these contradictions have to be looked for. They are also able to distinguish between differing types of statement. For example, they can understand the difference between a statement of fact and a statement of opin -\nion. This naturally affects the expertise of their reasoning processes as it makes a great deal of difference whether an argument is based on opinions or facts! \nThe core of critical thinking is the constant and considered identifcation and chal -\nlenging of the accepted truth. It requires the evaluation of values and beliefs as well as competing truth explanations and, of course, texts. It involves both rationality/objectivity and emotions/subjectivity and the questioning of the very categories of thought that are accepted as proper ways of proceeding. If you think critically, you will: \n  search for hidden assumptions; \n  justify assumptions; \n  judge the rationality of those assumptions; \n  test the accuracy of those assumptions. \nTexts will form the bare bones of much of your studies. They are delivered in language \nthat has to be read, interpreted, questioned and seen in its fragmented contexts, so it is vital to develop a critical approach. The critical thinker has to engage not only with micro-questions within a text, from both superfcial and deep readings, but also with macro issues surrounding topics, courses and ultimately the legal system. Much of your degree study will involve working with legal primary or secondary texts, reconciling, \n2 S Cottrell Critical Thinking Skills: Developing Effective Analysis and Argument  (Palgrave Macmillan, \nLondon, 2005), 3. \n\n--- Page 303 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 272 CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT \ndistinguishing and/or following the arguments of others, as well as the tentative con -\nstruction of your own arguments. You must be able to identify arguments set out in texts, offer your views on their weaknesses and strengths, and understand why an argument can be considered good or bad. Much of your time may be spent explaining alternative interpretations that may be very close to one another. When deciding what words mean in texts we make far-reaching decisions and often engage with morals, religion, justice and ethics. Critical thinkers look for hidden assumptions underlying the face value explanations of texts. They are not deceived by theorists, particularly those who make claims of neutrality, and are aware of the power of language and the value of argument. They know that all texts are not logical and do not necessarily feel that they have to be so. \nIt could happen that you are asked to ‘critically evaluate’ a work by a leading scholar, \neven in your frst year of studying. This seems quite intimidating to many students – after all, the scholar has devoted her life to studying the topic and analysing it back and forth, and you have only just started looking at legal texts! However, ‘critically evaluate’ does not necessarily mean that you have to fnd mistakes. By analysing an argument, you can learn a lot about how to construct a theory or an argument. And by looking at critiques that other scholars make, you can learn a lot about how to criticise work yourself. \nIf you identify and carefully take apart the arguments of leading academics, you will \nlearn how they put together an excellent argument. You will begin to extract from an article, or a chapter in a book, the main and secondary arguments. You will identify the evidence that they have used to support their arguments. You will also see many ways of structuring arguments. You will of course come across some academics who argue most elegantly, interlinking the parts of their argument to create a highly persuasive conclusion. \nWhen you read the work of these academics or when you read any material, you \nshould be in the process of having a dialogue with that writer in your head as you read, make notes and consider what you are reading. Academics, professionals and especially students cannot fnd out everything for themselves through the frst-hand experience of doing research and evaluating it. They have to rely on the work of other people who have done the initial research. But that work should only be relied on after you have subjected it to careful consideration and critique. You should never accept the arguments of another without careful refection and if possible double-checking the evidence supporting the arguments. In other words not just the argument but the evidence it is based on should be subjected to critical refection and analysis. \nIt is also important for students to learn quickly that in actual fact theories, inter -\npretation or arguments may only be partially correct. As you ask, and answer, some of your critical questions you will develop a better understanding of areas of study. This will allow you to competently discuss increasingly complex topics as your under -\nstanding of the topic develops. In academic life new questions constantly arise and cannot be resolved by an internet search. It is then your task to apply known under -\nstandings to the new circumstances and questions. You are only expected to identify \n\n--- Page 304 ---\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT 273 \nand understand the relevance of new questions in your area of study to engage with \nthem. You are certainly not expected to resolve any new intellectual and academic dilemmas. \nCritical thinking is a dynamic process involving a range of different mental pro -\ncesses, including attention to detail, focus, organisation and classifcation, and ulti -\nmately evaluative judgment of the arguments you are reading. For the frst months of study, and even the frst year, critical thinking will be somewhat of an artifcial process that you need to keep remembering. Ultimately, it will become a way of looking at the world so that you automatically question everything and evaluate it, and where neces -\nsary adjust your understanding. If you subject your own arguments to critical evalua -\ntion, in time the habit of employing critical thinking as you read and write will become ingrained. \nIn the academic life of the university it is normal to critically query the correctness of \nthe reasoning of other academics and to state your doubts about their strength as long as you back this up with evidence. However, just as in real life, there is a level at which we must operate on trust despite all our questions as critical thinkers. We need to trust at times that the argument we read is based on information that is plausibly correct, but we need to make informed decisions about what we choose to take on trust. In academic study it is expected that our belief in certain academic points of view or positions are fully explored so that we more fully understand the basis of that belief. As you acquire better habits of critical thinking as a process you will more naturally become aware that your emotional standpoints, and your attitudes to the author, have to be placed to one side. You will realise that you need to take a neutral objective view as you approach a text and identify and evaluate the arguments to ascertain whether they are plausible or not. At that point you are ready to express your own view, your own argument and forward your own evidence to support it. \nAlways remember that an author must give you clear reasons for each of his or her \narguments before you take a position agreeing or disagreeing with the argument. As you move through the levels of study over the years of your degree you should fnd that the quality of your reasoning improves substantially. Ultimately you will be able to evaluate quickly and effciently the reasoning of others, spot internal contradictions in their work and ‘read between the lines’ and identify or hazard a guess at the underlying or hidden assumptions that the argument is based upon. You will far more easily engage in com -\nparing and contrasting the opinions of the academic authors you read, and you too will be able to form categories and engage in the prediction of outcomes. Above all you will become competent in the skill of attention to detail. \nAll these skills are not only useful to you as a student, but will be helpful for whatever \nyou decide to do after your studies. Whether you become a lawyer or start a different career altogether, the ability to understand and question arguments and assumptions will be of enormous importance for your success. Critical thinking enables you to understand not only the motivations and reasons other people might have, but it also enables you to question your own decisions, saving you from making mistakes! \n\n--- Page 305 ---\n   \n   274 CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT \nCritical thinking and conspiracy theories \nIt has become more and more popular for people to call themselves ‘critical thinkers’ and \nto question what they call the ‘mainstream media’. However, often this is based on very uncritical thinking. \nWhile it is good to question prevailing narratives, authorities and the media, and to \nexplore what the communication is based on, formulating simple explanations itself vio -\nlates the rules of critical thinking. The common conspiracy theories are claiming to be critical because they refuse to follow the mainstream, but then usually fall into the same trap by fnding simple explanation models for everything. Believing that a hidden world government of billionaires, Jews or lizard people is controlling each and every aspect of society is the absolute opposite of critical thinking. \nA true critical thinker is never satisfed with a simple answer to a complex problem. \nMake sure to avoid this fallacy! \nProblems and rules \nBefore continuing to discuss the details of argument construction and the legal reasoning preferences of the English legal system it is useful to look briefy at the nature of problems and rules. Legal disputes are arenas in which legal rules are used to resolve problems. Therefore, a proper understanding of the interpretation and deployment of legal rules is essential to constructing a good argument. However, choices can always be made about which rules to apply, and how to apply them to specifc legal problems. \nWe will consider general matters about the idea of problems and rules. This will \nencourage you to take a broader view of legal rules and legal problems, which will be of use in your legal analysis. \nThe nature of problems \nProblems occur in a variety of different contexts, and include for example: \n  a diffcult question put forward for an answer in scholastic disputation; \n  the question asked in the standard formal logic method of deductive reasoning; \n  in mathematics and physics, a problem is an investigation or a question which, start -\ning from our idea of a ‘given position’, investigates some fact, result or law. \nTwining and Miers, writing in the context of handling legal rules, give a more detailed \ndescription: \nA problem arises for an individual when she is faced with a puzzling question to answer, or a diffcult choice to make, or some obstacle in the way of achieving a particular objective. A person is faced with a theoretical problem when she is \n\n--- Page 306 ---\n    \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT 275 \nStep 1: CLARIFICATION of individual’s standpoint, \nrole, objec\u000bves, general posi\u000bon. \nStep 2: PERCEPTION by individual of the facts \ncons\u000btu\u000bng the situa\u000bon. \nStep 3: EVALUATION of one or more of the elements \nmaking the situa\u000bon undesirable, obstruc\u000bve or bad \n(in other words, ‘what’s the problem?’). \nStep 4: IDENTIFICATION of a range of possible \nsolu\u000bons to the perceived problem. \nStep 5: PREDICTION of: \n(a) the cost of each op\u000bon \n(b) obstacles associated with each op\u000bon. \nStep 6: PRESCRIPTION : choosing a solu\u000bon to the \nproblem and the construc\u000bon of an e“ec\u000bve policy for solving the problem. \nStep 7: IMPLEMENTATION of that policy. \nFigure 9.3 Twining and Miers’ problem-solving model Iden˜fca˜on of the problem \nDiagnosis of the \nproblem \nPrescrip˜on for \nsolu\u000bon followed \nby implementa˜on \nof \nsolu\u000bon \nconfronted by a question calling for an answer that dissolves the puzzlement or \nsolves the problem, without necessarily calling for action. A person is faced with a practical problem when there is some doubt about what to do. It is unwise to draw too sharp a line between theoretical and practical problems.\n3 \nOf course it is not just individuals who have problems; problems can have a corporate or social impact requiring community or societal action. The real issue is how you move from problem to solution; something students often fnd diffcult. If you can correctly identify, classify and interpret problems, you will be able to begin the journey from problem to solution. But solving problems also requires imagination and solutions can even involve guessing and testing. Twining and Miers point out that problems change their nature according to the perspective or standpoint from which they are viewed.\n4 \nEven a seemingly simple problem can be complex for those seeking a solution. Many \nproblems come not as single units but as a series of interconnected issues and prob -\nlems. Problems, like so many other issues, are processes, often complex processes. If you do not understand the nature of problems generally, it can be diffcult to understand the nature of legal rules and the complexity of using legal rules as solutions to problems. \nSolving problems \nProblem-solving and problem management are parts of everyday life, and the skills you have developed in these areas can help you turn your attention to more methodical \n3 W Twining and D Miers How To Do Things with Rules (5th edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, \n2013), 114. \n4 Ibid. \n\n--- Page 307 ---\n   \n \n \n 276 CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT \napproaches when dealing with complex legal problems. However, you may not always \nbe aware of how you solve life problems, and some of the techniques you may use, like anger, fear, frustration or running away, would be most unsuitable in academic work. \nJust as legal problems themselves can comprise a series of interconnected issues \nand problems, their solutions are the end product of a series of complicated interrelated operations. \nEffective problem-solving involves accurately: \n  identifying that there is a problem; \n  classifying what type of problem it is (this determines much about the eventual solution); \n  presenting a solution to the problem. \nSolutions can be aimed at dealing with the problem or making the problem-solver feel better. Solutions aimed at making the problem-solver feel better could include doing nothing, removing themselves from the situation, or effecting a reconciliation and extrac -\ntion of a promise not to repeat the behaviour. \nIn many disciplines, professionals use problem-solving models which enable users to \ncheck certain steps along the road to eventual solution. One of the best known and most useful problem-solving methods within legal education is the model set out in Twining and Miers.\n5 Their seven steps model for problem solution is set out in Figure 13 .3. They \nidentify issues of identifcation (steps 1–3), classifcation (step 3), prescription (steps 4–6) and implementation of the solution (step 7) \nMany organisations and individuals can be too quick to jump to step 6 (prescription) \nbefore they have had an opportunity to correctly diagnose the problem. This is unfortu -\nnately quite typical for how many solve problems – from the government quickly acting on the issue of the day to students addressing an essay question. \nEven when you try to follow a model or imagine all eventualities, solutions to problems \ncan often cause more problems. If you search deeper into a problem, it is usually found to be a cluster of problems with a range of causes, and a range of potential solutions, each with a different set of obstacles and costs. This means lawyers tend to solve problems in a range of ways, mostly revolving around the application and meaning of legal rules. \nThe nature of rules \nThere are many meanings of the word ‘rule’. A rule can be a principle or a maxim govern -\ning individual or group conduct in life or in a game. Some rules only have force within religious or social settings; others have an effect within legal settings. Some rules only have force within a given academic discipline, such as philosophy, law or indeed legal method. Even language is subject to rules such as the rules of grammar and punctuation. Figure 13 .4 sets out a defnition of a rule highlighting its constituent parts. \n5 Ibid. \n\n--- Page 308 ---\n    \n  CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT 277 \nan oral or wri\u0017en statement \nguiding the conduct of individuals and/or groups \ninfringement of which \nmay or may not \nresult in compulsory or discre\bonary \nac\bon being taken to enforce observance of the rule \nFigure 9.4 The defnition of a rule \nDifferent rules share these general characteristics but vary in terms of who has the \npower to create or interpret them and what the consequences for breaking them might \nbe. \nA rule often represents the view of a group concerning lawful, moral or socially accept -\nable action. For example, the English legal system, like most legal systems, values human life and prohibits unlawful killing. The ‘Do not kill’ rule also has social and moral functions, backed by a range of religious or philosophical groups worldwide. To enable these func -\ntions to be enforced the rule has been given a legal base and infringement can lead to severe penalties. There will always be diffcult situations even when a legal rule and its standard meanings seem to be fxed. In this example, consider the different defnitions of life (e.g. in the case of an abortion), the different positions different countries have taken to the death penalty over time, or the discussions on assisted suicide/euthanasia. \nFigure 9 .4 sets out the different classifcations of rules that you might come across. \nRules in general – and legal rules are no exception – relate to people engaging in cer -\ntain activities, either in thought, word or deed. Particular words are used to enforce this and some of these are set out in Figure 9 .6. \nRules affect behaviour in a range of ways. They can: \n  stop action (prescriptive rules); \n  guide action (normative rules); \n  allow action (facilitative rules). \nLegal rules \nA rule that has not been created by the law making process or accepted by those empow -\nered to create law is a legal rule. In England, all legal rules are created by state-author -\nised procedures (judges are offce holders in the state institutions of the court). They are \n\n--- Page 309 ---\n   \n  \n  278 CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT \nClassifca˘on of rules \nLegal Moral Religious Academic \nCivil Criminal Cons˘tu˘onal \nSocial \nScience Language \nArts Sciences \nPhilosophy Social \nFormal Informal \nWork Work E˘que“e School Family Friends \nFigure 9.5 Classifcation of rules ProhibiˇonMay not \nShould not \nCannot Persuasive Ought \nMust May Should Can \nFigure 9.6 A vocabulary of rule-making verbs Must/Must Not \nOught not \nMust not \nVocabulary of \nrule-making \nverbs May/May Not Can/Cannot \nShould/Should No t \nDo/Do Not \n\n--- Page 310 ---\n    CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT 279 \nenforced by the power of the state. Often, the diffculty with legal rules is that they need \nto be general and need to be applied to specifc, particular situations. This means that the wording of legal rules needs to be carefully considered. But inevitably these words will be the object of interpretation. That a rule seems applicable may be clear, but the precise meaning of an important word or phrase may not always be. \nStatutory rules in our simple majority democracy often refect the political values of \nthe party in power. They can, therefore, be described as instruments of policy. Whatever the original intention of the political designers of the statutory rule, when users of these rules come to interpret them, defects in design are often apparent because words can, so often, be made to mean what the originator did not intend them to mean: another reminder that language is fexible. \nConstructing arguments \nNow that a little thought has been given to: \n  the meaning of argument; \n  critical thinking; \n  the nature of problems and rules; \n  the mediating power of language. \nit is hoped that the complexity of any attempt to solve problems by recourse to rules is \nbetter appreciated. Now we are in a position to consider how to argue. \nHow to argue \nIt is essential that lawyers are able to construct arguments and use effective reasoning to resolve legal problems. Without that core skill, a lawyer lacks competence. One of the diffculties of legal argument is that the answer to a legal problem in court is rarely clear cut. All the evidence will not necessarily have the same degree of plausibility, or be of the same strength. The law may be unclear, and all of these issues need to be ordered into the best argument that can be constructed. This is why argument involves the deploy-ment of imagination and creativity alongside an understanding of applicable legal rules and the problems they address. \nThe good news is that argument construction utilises a number of preparatory skills \nyou have already engaged with: \n  fnding appropriate texts and choosing the most useful; \n  summarising texts; \n  researching and organising texts; \n  critique and analysis; \n  collecting appropriate materials in order to persuade the listener of the validity of the \narguments presented. \n\n--- Page 311 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 280 CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT \nReasoning involves: \n  preparation and collection of information; \n  ordering and organisation of information; \n  working through the information once the issues that it supports are clear. \nWhen people set out on a journey, they normally have an idea of where they are going. If \nthey do not know where they are going, this is usually a matter of deliberate choice. When you begin to consider argument construction, you need to know where you are going: ‘to begin with the end in mind’. If you do not know where you are going, you may become exhausted and frustrated and end up arbitrarily writing in your essay or problem solution, words that imply ‘therefore, this is the end’. It is not possible to craft a good argument by accident. Having said that, useful information to include as evidence for an argument may be uncovered accidentally. However, the argument itself can never be accidentally or mind-lessly constructed. It is a technical ability that must be understood and practised knowingly. \nEvidence \nLegal argument is a delicate balance of propositions backed by evidence. Such evidence will depend on the context of the argument and could involve facts, legal rules and theo -\nries. If the dispute is a legal problem, argument construction will be concerned with the application of existing rules connected by reasoned comments to persuade the listener of the validity of adopting the outcome suggested. In the courtroom, both parties put for -\nward arguments and the judge chooses the argument that is either the most persuasive or the closest to the judge’s own belief concerning the outcome of the case. Evidence substantially increases the persuasiveness of an argument. An argument that is a series of propositions not backed by evidence is unlikely to succeed in any area of study or dispute resolution. On your course you will need to engage with tasks that require you to apply legal rules to hypothetical fact scenarios in legal problem solution activities. \nThe role of judicial judgments in argument construction \nWhen reading judgments, you will note that judges present their decisions in the form of reasoned responses to the questions posed by the case. In the trial court, conficting claims are resolved by a judge or multiple judges, and in the senior courts, judges con -\nsider the grounds of appeal. The case will be decided on the basis of the most persuasive argument when it comes to the specifc grounds of appeal. Obviously, that decision can be quite subjective – something that you see as a good argument for you might not be a good argument for the judge. \nThe reasoning most valued within law demonstrates a consistency of approach and \nlogic; consistency is highly valued. However, the law is not, and cannot be, a closed sys -\ntem. Analytically there are always other possibilities, which inevitably means that much \n\n--- Page 312 ---\n    \n CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT 281 \nlegal decision making is contingent. There may be a better solution, and if one is located \nin another case then decision making may change according to the restraints of the doc -\ntrine of precedent. \nNo argument can ever be 100 per cent sound and our legal system requires less than \nperfect proof. In a civil court the contingent nature of legal decision making turns on proof based ‘on a balance of probabilities’. This means that when the arguments of litigants are weighed against each other, one litigant’s argument appears to be more probably cor -\nrect. In the criminal trial courts the contingent nature of legal decision making is demon -\nstrated by the requirement that the court fnds that the prosecution, or the defence, has ‘proved beyond all reasonable doubt’ the correctness of their argument. So, accusing someone of not having a perfect argument is not in itself a good argument. \nFor the practising lawyer, a valid argument is of the utmost importance. In the class -\nroom, you are constantly called upon to practise and refne your skills in legal problem-solving by engaging in reasoning processes leading to full-scale argument construction. \nIt is now time to explore and apply the more formal aspects of general argument con -\nstruction: logic, deduction and induction. \nLogic \nIt is generally believed that academic and professional lawyers and, indeed, law students are skilled in the art of legal reasoning, which rests on logic. Furthermore, it is believed that they are people who argue ‘logically’. To most, the term ‘logical’ indicates that a per -\nson can separate the relevant from the irrelevant and come to an objective view, based often on supposedly objective formulae. Colloquially, people sometimes accuse those who change their mind or who are emotional in their arguing, of allowing their emotions to get the better of them, of ‘not being logical’. \nThe dictionary defnes logic as the science of reasoning, thinking, proof or inference. \nInference involves drawing a conclusion from something known or assumed using reasoning. \nLogic can even be defned as a science in its own right, a sub-branch of philosophy \nthat deals with the scientifc method in argument and the uses of inference. The German philosopher Georg Hegel described logic as the fundamental science of thought and its categories. It can certainly claim to be an accurate form of reasoning: its root is found in the Greek word logos meaning reason. \nIn natural sciences, things are relatively easy (please do not show this to a natural \nscientist!): a physicist sets up an experiment and observes what happens – the evidence is usually quite clear. Lawyers, however, are usually not there to observe what happens and have to rely on a variety of different evidence: witness statements, statements by the parties themselves, evidence obtained by forensic science, photos, videos and so on. All of that evidence has to be compiled and evaluated legally before presenting it and using it in an argument. \nIn logic, people deal in statements or ‘propositions’. In the context of logic, the word \n‘proposition’ can be most simply explained as a statement or assertion about something. \n\n--- Page 313 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n  282 CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT \nMore particularly it is a statement that is put forward as the basis of an argument that \nbrings evidence for or against its validity. A proposition is expressed as a sentence. In the science of logic, the proposition takes on a more formal role as a particular type of sentence statement in which the topic of the sentence, the predicate is affrmed or denied concerning the subject of the sentence. \nTo put this more simply in English the predicate of a sentence is that part of the sen -\ntence in which you are told something about the subject. The subject is what the sentence is about (a person, a category, a class or concepts). In a formal argument it is expected that there is proof for the predicate in the proposition. \nEssentially, logic is the study of propositions and how conclusions may be correctly \nobtained from them through the process of reasoned argument. There are two main types of logical reasoning: deduction and induction. Each of these will be discussed below. \nDeduction \nDeductive reasoning occurs in an extremely stylised manner and follows a standard pro -\ncedure and structure. It is the process by which two statements (propositions) containing information are used to construct a third concluding statement. This draws out of the precise wording of the previous two propositions, new information to express by way of a concluding statement. \nStatements are variously called ‘premises’ or ‘propositions’. There is no permission to conclude by way of plausibility or probabilities: the third \nstatement conclusion can only be extracted from the linguistic forms making up the major and minor statements. Therefore the conclusion of a deductive argument is said to be compelled, and the reasoning system is closed. The formal model used for this argument is called a syllogism. \nIn deductive reasoning, the argument follows a prescribed form called a syllogism, as \nset out in Figure 9 .7. The frst statement in a deductive argument is known as the ‘major \npremise’ and it is a general or normative statement; the second statement is known as the minor premise and it is particular rather than general. The third statement is the conclusion. Figure 9 .7 sets these three statements out as the component parts of deductive reasoning. \n• A major premise – which tends to \nstate a generality \nThis form of \n• A minor premise – which tends to argument is called \nstate a par\u0007cularity a syllogis m \n• Conclusion \nFigure 9.7 The components of a deductive reasoning argument \n\n--- Page 314 ---\n    CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT 283 \nTo give a concrete illustration we will consider the fctional character of Anna, who is \naccused of stealing a book from a book store, an act that is contrary to s 1 of the Theft \nAct 1968, which prohibits stealing. The argument against her can be set out as follows: \nMajor premise: stealing is contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1968. \nMinor premise: Anna has stolen a book. Conclusion: therefore Anna has committed theft under s 1 of the Theft Act. \nYou may already have noticed from this scheme of argument that deductive reasoning \nleaves no space for examining the truth or otherwise of the premises making it up. It is therefore of limited use within a legal context. This leads us to note that in fact whilst a deductive argument can be logically valid (that is it is expressed in the correct form) it cannot be assumed to be true. We can easily verify the truth of the major proposition (that stealing is against s 1 of the Theft Act) by checking the primary law. But we have no way of knowing if the minor proposition is true without a full trial. The proof or otherwise of the major and minor premises is outside the remit of deductive reasoning. \nAnalytically there are always other possibilities. A deductive syllogism can be useful \nwhen a precedent is being teased out for the frst time and its logical consequences need to be tracked. It is also useful for pinpointing exactly what aspects of a legal rule have been infringed. \nInduction \nInductive reasoning involves arguments that put forward a frst particular proposition, or thesis, followed by a series of propositions relating to facts and evidence. The last propo -\nsition, or conclusion, is drawn out of the previous propositions. One of the most important differences from deductive reasoning is that the reasoning system is open, meaning it can be possible for more than one conclusion to be drawn. It is based on inferences. Then decision makers need to choose the conclusion they consider the most plausible in light of the arguments presented to them. \nAs with deductive reasoning, the conclusions are based on propositions. However, in \ninductive reasoning, the conclusion reached extends beyond the facts in the premise. It is not compelled; it is drawn out. The supporting propositions make the conclusion prob -\nable, but there is no one absolutely clearly correct conclusion as there is for deductive argument. \nAn inductive argument can, for example, have as an inference a generalisation, such \nas ‘innocent people do not run away’. Different types of generalisations are set out in Figure 9 .8. \nA generalisation can be quite easily challenged as it is usually constructed on fimsy \narguments. Inductive argument is perhaps the closest to the everyday legal argument where decisions are made concerning which party to a legal dispute wins the case because their ‘story’, in terms of the law’s authority about the way current law applies to \n\n--- Page 315 ---\n   \n  \n  284 CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT \nGeneralisa\u0017ons \nScien\u0017fc \nlaw/opinion Widely held, \nshared conclusions \nof common \nexperience (e.g. \ninnocent people \ndon't run away) Biases, prejudices, \nheld irrespec\u0017ve \nof data or \nopera\u0017ve beliefs \nFigure 9.8 Types of standard generalisations which can fnd their way into inductive argument \ntheir claim, is accepted by the court, a story that will have been made up of a range of \nmain and subsidiary arguments. \nLike deductive reasoning, from a purely scientifc point of view, inductive reasoning \nhas no interest in the actual truth of the propositions that lead to the conclusion. The court, on the contrary, is most concerned with establishing that the conclusion is cor -\nrect and that the propositions are correct. Just because a logical form is correctly con -\nstructed, it does not mean that the conclusion expressed is true. The truth of a conclusion depends upon whether the major and minor premises express statements that are true. The statements may be false. Much time is spent by lawyers in court attempting to prove the truth of statements used as building blocks in the construction of arguments. \nThink back to our one-line propositions above about Anna stealing a book. The pros -\necution may argue she stole the book because she was seen leaving the store with it. The defence will wish to argue that she did not. Or the defence may argue, say, that she did not leave the store intending to take the book but intending to look at the quality of its colour plates in daylight. Both sides will have to support their argument with evidence. The side that the court decides has the stronger argument backed by evidence will win the case. \nAnalogous reasoning \nA subdivision of inductive reasoning is reasoning by analogy or analogous reasoning. The Greek word ‘analogy’ means likeness, or similarity, and is used to describe the equality of ratios of proportions in mathematics. In logic it expresses the resemblance of attributes between two or more things. \nAnalogous reasoning is used in English legal reasoning. Lawyers in the courts argue \nfrom rules developed in previous cases on the grounds they are alike. As you may realise this is the reasoning required by the doctrine of judicial precedent. In doing this they rea -\nson from the general to the particular, applying abstract generalised rules from previous cases to the particular current case. \n\n--- Page 316 ---\n    \n CONSTRUCTING AN ARGUMENT 285 \nLogical fallacies \nSomething to be aware of, both when constructing your own argument and when dis -\nsecting an opponent’s arguments, are logical fallacies. This means drawing conclusions \nthat appear logical, but are in fact wrong, something you can often observe in political debates, personal arguments, but also in the courtroom and in academic writing. \nThere are plenty of examples for logical fallacies, and with some practice in critical \nthinking, you will be able to spot many of them yourself. They often are deceptive – the human brain likes taking shortcuts, and many of these fallacies exploit that characteristic. Typical examples are strawman arguments (exaggerating the opponent’s argument into an obviously undesirable extreme – ‘raising welfare benefts will mean that lazy people who don’t want to work can live in huge houses with swimming pools’), false equivalences (describing two different things as equal – ‘sure, most murderers are men. But have you thought about the fact that a lot of pickpockets are women?’), false dilemmas (describing a situation with only two outcomes when there are more – ‘if we don’t implement this wel -\nfare plan, thousands of people will starve’) or ad hominem  attacks (personal attacks that \nhave nothing to do with the actual argument – ‘the fact that you have no children shows that your opinions about the future are irrelevant’). \nCONCLUSION \nHopefully, this chapter helped you to understand how a good argument is built so that you can construct and dismantle arguments yourself. With this skill, you can not only convince others of your standpoint, but also understand how others try to convince you, take that argument apart and identify its weaknesses. This is the key to success in any area – inside and outside of the university. \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  An argument is a series of statements, some backed by evidence, some not, which are purposely presented in order to prove, or disprove, a given position. \n  Problem-solving models can help you work in order through the key steps. \n  A good model for law is Twining and Miers’ Diagnostic model (clarifcation, percep -\ntion, evaluation, identifcation, prediction, prescription and implementation). \n  If a legal problem is wrongly diagnosed, any argument constructed will be as fawed as the erroneous diagnosis in the frst place. \n  Deductive reasoning is a closed system of logic in which the only possible conclu -\nsion is compelled from the major and minor propositions. \n  Inductive reasoning is an open system of logic in which the probable conclusion is drawn out of the propositions.

During \nyour study, you will be required to write a lot of them, critically analysing laws or cases, questioning decisions or discussing statements. Like no other form of assessment, an essay gives you the chance to delve deep into a topic and to explore it from all angles. Many (probably most) undergraduate degrees and more or less all postgraduate degrees also include the task of writing a dissertation: a longer essay for which you usually deter -\nmine the topic yourself with the help of your supervisor. \nThe module leader will set a maximum word count for the essay, and it is important \nthat you stick to it. This can be frustrating – often you run out of words with many more ideas to write down. But it is crucial for success. Your lecturer did not choose this word count because she wanted to make your life more diffcult or because she is too lazy to read more, but because being concise is an essential skill to learn as a law student and as a lawyer. Most universities have strict penalties on exceeding the word count – some deduct points according to how many words you went above; others draw a line at the allowed number of words and ignore the rest (which means the lecturer will most likely not read the clever conclusion you wrote!) – make sure you are aware of these and make sure you do not encounter them. If you encounter this regularly, check your writing style (see below) and try to avoid anything that is not strictly necessary for your argument. \nLecturers often use standard words to formulate the essay question, and you can see \nan overview in Table 10 .1. \nDespite these differences, the requirements for an essay are always the same: \n  Discussion of academic texts and in many cases legal texts. \n  The construction of arguments in order to write the essay. \n  The use of critical thinking. \nApproaching the essay question \nChoosing the topic \nThe frst task you often face is to pick an essay question. Some module leaders give stu -\ndents multiple questions to choose from, and in a dissertation module you normally have to work out the question yourself. \nPicking a question is not easy, but it is important not to overthink it. Module leaders \nchoose questions that enable you to give good answers – contrary to student opinion, the choice of question does not in itself determine the mark of the essay. Read all the ques -\ntions carefully and think about which of the topics interested you the most. Once you have chosen a question, stick to it unless you run into a complete dead end – last-minute topic changes are a common source for bad marks and sometimes even failure! \n\n--- Page 320 ---\n    \n  \n WRITING LAW ESSAYS 289 \nTABLE 10.1 DEFINITION OF STANDARD WORDS USED IN ESSAY \nINSTRUCTIONS \nActivity word Defnition \nAccount for Give a detailed explanation of events with reasons for those events (what is \nit and why is it). \nAccount of Give a detailed description, but just to tackle ‘What’, not ‘why’. \nAnalyse Break down one or several things into their various parts; and detail how these parts interact. \nArgue Maintaining a given position based on evidence. \nAssess Weigh up the strengths and weaknesses, the pros and cons of the issue(s) raised. \nClarify Make clear: which could mean to intelligently simplify or explain a theory, institution or process; or to clearly differentiate between two things. \nComment on Demonstrate understanding of what the question or quote is asking/ saying and then give your answer backed by evidence from academic sources. \nCompare Identify both similarities and differences between two things (this could be two judgments in two cases or the same case, or it could be between different ideas on legal reform). \nConsider Give your thoughtful view of a matter backing it with relevant academic evidence. \nContrast Oppose several ideas, processes, judgments or texts, and bring out differences. Whilst similarities should be noted the main thrust of this word is to speak of difference. \nCritically evaluate Careful consideration of an argument and its evidences drawing out hidden assumptions, and determining your view of the strengths and weaknesses of arguments and/or evidences. You should discuss any material that does not back you. \nCriticise Identify arguments about theory or cases, question existing beliefs and assumptions, making a judgment based on the persuasiveness and authority of the sources you have located as the basis for your answer. \nDefne Set out the meaning or the interpretation of a word or phrase; in law there may be competing meanings in which case you may be asked to give a view as to which is best. \nDemonstrate Show how something is done and give examples. \nDescribe Set out the main characteristics of an object or a concept, or give a chronological account of what is happening in a given situation. \n(Continued ) \n\n--- Page 321 ---\n   \n  290 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nTABLE 10.1 (CONTINUED) DEFINITION OF STANDARD WORDS USED IN \nESSAY INSTRUCTIONS \nActivity word Defnition \nDiscuss Conduct an investigation of an area to consider and evaluate the strengths \nand weaknesses of arguments coming to an overall conclusion on that area or process. \nElaborate Information will have been given in the question or a quotation; your job here is to add more detail to the given information. \nEvaluate Determine the value of something. \nExamine A meticulous look at the key issues related to a topic which you then need to critically evaluate. \nExplain An intelligent clear description of how something can be understood, defning words as needed. \nExplore Looking at a topic from differing analytic perspectives to present an argument backed by evidence. \nIdentify Determine the main issues to be dealt with. \nIllustrate This is very much like ‘explain’ or even ‘demonstrate’; you need to show how something works using evidence to back your explanation. \nInterpret Display your understanding of arguments, words, process, research or a given topic and discuss relationships between items and theories by putting forward your view as to what they mean and ensuring that you support your view with evidence. \nJustify Put forward your views with reasoning and support it backed by academic evidence. Presenting an argument that is well-considered and takes into account opposing positions. \nOutline This is a request to give a general, explanatory discussion of an area. \nReview Critically evaluate an area or topic, assessing its strength and weakness with evidence. This is often a two-part question, with a second part asking you to interpret or explain etc. \nShow how Similar to giving an account of (see above). \nState Lay out the main issues relating to a topic with reference to available evidence. \nSummarise Produce a brief précis of the relevant area only composed of relevant material or information. \n\n--- Page 322 ---\n    WRITING LAW ESSAYS 291 \nChoosing a dissertation topic is even more challenging. Normally, the dissertation \nmodule comes at the end of your studies. By now, you must have preferences for which \ntopic interests you the most, and in your lectures, discussions or news consumption you might have come across questions or situations that frustrated you about the state of the law. These are often the best dissertations: students have seen a problem and want to address it. Do make sure that you manage to stay objective in such a case, though. If a topic is too close to your heart to remain objective and to give honest consideration to the other side of the argument, it might be better to avoid it. Make sure to use the opportuni -\nties given by the module leader and the lecturer you would like to use as a supervisor to discuss the topic before deciding on the title. \nRefecting on the question \nThis is an exercise in basic English comprehension as well as an intellectual act, requiring a considered and methodical approach. You need to draw out all of the possible issues raised by your essay question. An effective way to begin to do this is to ask questions of your essay question, such as: \n  What is being asked? \n  How many issues are raised? \nThe actual essay question must be constantly borne in mind as texts are read and \nresearch is conducted. It is very useful to convert the question into a tree diagram that can be annotated as texts are collected. \nLet us look at an example question: \nThe English legal system is like a house that is not only too small, it is in need of repair. The question is do we build another extension and repair as necessary or pull the whole thing down and start again? \nDiscuss the issues arising from this quotation. \nThis is a standard quotation followed by a bland request to ‘discuss the issues arising’. But you are not told what the issues are, so immediately you know that part of the test is your discovery of the ‘issues arising’. \nThe quotation that you have been given is not referenced. It may be the case that it \nis an invented quotation by the lecturer. But equally it could be an actual non-attributed quotation that you might even come across when researching. If you do then you could mention its source. \n\n--- Page 323 ---\n   \n  292 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nYou should also notice that this quotation presents itself as a metaphor. This should \nnot be overlooked but engaged with. Our working defnition of metaphor is that metaphor \ncompares one thing with another either for emphasis or explanation or to describe the unknown by means of the known. Here it is used to describe one thing in terms of another. \nThe frst thing to do is break down the metaphor into its parts. Then each part can be \nconsidered. You may have immediately understood that this is a question about reform and the nature of it, whether in parts or radical wholesale reform. If you did not, do not worry. Draw out your radial diagram as shown in Figure 10 .1, but leave the centre empty \n(this is the core that joins all of the outlying circles). When you have added the metaphor in those circles you may well have found the core issue. \nThere are a number of options referred to in the metaphor; you just need to check back \nto see you caught them all. You may already know quite a bit about this area so you could move to each outlying circle and make it the centre of another diagram. When this is done it is time to move to the next stage. \nThe ‘house’ in the question is the English legal system and you are invited to further \nconsider what the metaphoric terms ‘repair’, ‘extension’ and ‘pulling down’ might mean. Translating this back to our task in the question, we need to look at our house, what is wrong, and then discuss what reforms (repairs) may have been put forward, whether new \nIs the English \nlegal system \nft for \npurpose? . Should we just \nrepair the English \nlegal system? \nHas been too \nextended and the \nend is in sight? \nIs it too small? Should we tear the \nEnglish legal \nsystem down and \nstart again? \nFigure 10.1 Radial diagram for essay question  \n\n--- Page 324 ---\n    \n WRITING LAW ESSAYS 293 \nconcepts or processes have been put forward to deal with issues (extension) or whether an \nentirely new legal system should be developed (pulling it down and starting again). \nThroughout, we should critique ideas about repair or extension, but ultimately the \nquote asks you to choose which of these suggestions is viable. That is a matter for you after the relevant research and thought has gone into the question. But the metaphor also structures the main body of your essay and arguments, as well as the quote. \nResearching for your essay \nSearching for relevant texts \nOnce you have used your preferred techniques to deconstruct your essay task it is impor -\ntant to make sure that you have understood the material at the level you were dealing with it in class. The next stage therefore can involve looking through relevant chapters in your set textbook, or any recommended text (if there is no set text), your lecture notes, your seminar notes and any personal notes you have made extending lecture and seminar work. You may even fnd the source of any quotes used in your essay title this way. Then re-read your question in light of this superfcial trawl through your class-based material. See if what you have read has developed your understanding of the question in any way. If it has, make any changes to your deconstruction of the question. \nIt is at this point that you are well equipped to turn to research and begin to access \ntextbooks, academic books and articles, and any primary legal material you need. Do not forget to refer to any relevant parliamentary papers or other non-academic material, such as speeches, government or EU reports and departmental or EU briefngs.\n1 \nOrganising material \nAs you locate material that is relevant, save it, photocopy it and highlight it, or make notes. It is a good idea to set up a separate fle for this. Stage 3 therefore involves reading eve -\nrything with the actual question in mind and know what aspect of the question you are researching. \nExtract arguments presented and then reconsider the question, both in parts and as \na whole. \nThe frst task for your reading is asking the basic questions detailed below, whilst at \nthe same time recalling the actual issues detailed in the essay question you are doing the research for. Otherwise relevant details in your material could be overlooked. As you read texts you need to ask yourself questions that differ according to the text you are using, as shown below. \nLaw cases \n  What are the facts? \n  What legal rules have been applied and why? \n1 H ow to get the best out of your university library and research strategies for locating domestic and \nEuropean legislation and cases as well as researching secondary materials are discussed in Chapter 6 . \n\n--- Page 325 ---\n   294 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \n  How do the arguments presented assist in relation to the essay? \n  What aspects of this case are relevant to my essay? \nTextbooks \n  Do I understand what I am reading? \n  Does it ft with my understanding of the law or the topic? \n  Have I properly grasped the issues involved? \n  What is of relevance to my essay? \nAcademic books and articles \n  What is the writer’s argument? \n  Is it well supported by the evidence? \n  Does the writer’s argument support or deny my argument in the essay? \n  What is of relevance to my essay? \nIt is also important to note whether there is a majority view developing in the texts con -\ncerning any of the issues raised by the essay question. Go back to any diagram of the \nessay question that you have made during the frst stage when refecting upon the ques -\ntion. Reference your texts on the diagram so that you can see which elements of your essay question you have a number of references for and where you have none or few. You can then seek to look for more texts in these areas. \nThink about how your own views are developing on the various aspects of your ques -\ntion, but do keep an open mind. Your personal ideas may change as more research is conducted and some texts present persuasive arguments that you had not previously thought about. \nWhat you are doing in this stage is methodically going through your retrieved materi -\nals, organising them (as relevant or not relevant) and then classifying whether they relate to part of the question or all of the question. Then you will make notes effciently sum -\nmarising. Using the strategies already discussed in earlier chapters you are breaking into these texts and sifting them, ready to think about your answer. As you read each text keep returning to the question so you do not drift off course. You will then be in a good position to turn to issues of analysis, evaluation and critique. \nYou may fnd that as you engage in reading your retrieved material it raises issues that \nrequire you to return to researching in order to investigate matters further. \nForming an argument \nOnce the retrieved texts have been carefully prepared by ordering and summarising, then: \n  Potential arguments can be refected upon. \n  Arguments can be compared. \n  Differences of opinion expressed by judges and academics can be considered. \n\n--- Page 326 ---\n    \n \n WRITING LAW ESSAYS 295 \nAt this point, you can begin to have a personal view in answer to the essay task and begin \nto write. However, do not begin writing until you: \n  Understand each text as much as possible in isolation. \n  Have considered and understood the interconnections between the texts. \nLaw cases and texts that confict are as intimately interconnected as law cases and texts \nthat agree with each other. You should organise your materials as follows: \n  Materials containing arguments that are the same. \n  Materials containing arguments that are different. \n  Materials that are mixed in that in some areas they agree and some areas they \ndisagree. \nAs Chapter 9 on the anatomy of argument demonstrates, no problem is ever a simple unitary one; problems come in bundles. Whilst questions posed may appear simple and unitary, they never are. Not only is there no such thing as a simple question, but there is also no such thing as a simple answer. All questions are complex and, of necessity, all answers are complex. It is never suffcient to give as an answer a purely descriptive com -\nmentary. No questions posed to test your understanding will only require description. They will require evaluation and critique as well. You need to make choices. Decide what issues are most relevant; and what can, and what cannot, be discussed in the answer to the question. \nTexts that deny your argument are not to be ignored; they are to be dealt with. You \ncan argue that they are unreliable (for example, you may argue that the argument is pure theory with no evidence to back it up); you can argue that it is one possible plausible interpretation but that you are presenting another equally plausible interpretation. If you cannot explain away an argument denying your view, then perhaps you should reconsider your view. How strong is your argument? \nYour lecturer will know of texts that agree and disagree and will be looking to see if you \nhave properly dealt with all the material. \nYou should by now have a reasonably clear idea of how your argument may look. You \nwill know what supporting evidence you have and where your argument lacks supporting evidence. You do not have to throw out weak arguments if they serve to build a broader picture and support a broader argument. But this must be in the context of well-supported propositions or arguments. When you have considered all of your thoughts and potential arguments think carefully about how they apply to your essay, perhaps even returning to the essay the next day. Then refne your argument. Look back at your deconstruction of the question and deal with each assertion. Have you changed your views? Have you seen more issues that you did not see before? Do your arguments or descriptions only relate to what you have been asked or are any irrelevant? \n\n--- Page 327 ---\n   \n 296 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nStructuring your essay \nEach type of essay question requires a different approach, but the same three-part general \nstructure is required. The standard structure is disarmingly simple and is quite likely to be one that you are already familiar with: \n  A clear brief introduction. \n  The main part (the body) of the essay setting out main and secondary arguments. \n  A confdent comprehensive conclusion. \nThe function of the essay introduction \nThe role of the introduction is to clearly and succinctly set out the issues that the essay \nwill discuss (and why). It will give very brief details of the argument(s) to be presented, and indicates the conclusion. It is important to ‘begin with the end in mind’ as it is the intro -\nduction that is key in guiding the reader through your work. It may help you to understand its importance if you think of it as a road map directing the reader to the conclusion and indicating how they will get there. The introduction is also the section in which you set out any areas you have chosen not to discuss, giving your reasons for taking that course of action; often for reasons of word limit it is not viable to cover all potential areas. \nThe introduction should fnalise when the main body of the essay is fnished and your \nconclusions are clearer. You will need to check that the road map promised in your intro -\nduction is the one following in the main body and the conclusion. If it is not, because your views have changed, make sure this is refected in changes to the introduction. Often stu -\ndents forget the promises they make in their introduction and just do not deliver because they lost their way in the essay. \nThe main body of the text \nThe main part of the essay is often referred to as the body of the text. Here, you will set out the propositions of your argument(s) in a carefully pre-planned manner with your propositions supported by evidence from the texts and cases that you have consulted. It is absolutely essential to refer to case law, legislation, and textbooks and articles as appropriate in this main part of the essay or you will have nothing but unsupported claims that do not constitute an argument. \nIt is essential to understand that when writing assessed essays and exams you must \nuse academic texts, such as academic journal articles and academic books. Even though you may be required to discuss primary legal texts in detail these are not academic but legal texts. You must use academic comment and review of primary law. Do remember that primary law and in particular law cases on their own are just law; they are in no way academic. It is particularly important to read academic journals as these are pub -\nlished much more quickly than a book (which could be a year or more out of date when \n\n--- Page 328 ---\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  WRITING LAW ESSAYS 297 \npublished) and represent the latest thought in an area. An essay demands an academic \nresponse to the law. \nIt can take a long time to devise your argument and decide the best ordering of the \nbody text; make sure you plan enough time to do this. \nThe conclusion \nThe conclusion can do one of three things: \n  Answer the specifc question asked. \n  Finalise your own decisions concerning the critique and review of information you \nhave been given ‘to discuss’. \n  Present your fnal views on the issues you have been invited to extract for discussion. \nThe conclusion must align with your introduction and contain a very brief survey of your argument and the evidence supporting it, that also details its strengths and weaknesses before moving to your specifc concluding response to the essay task. \nWriting an outline \nNow you are ready to write an essay plan by looking at: \n  The diagram of the question you originally prepared. \n  The notes of cases and other texts. \n  The notes of your personal ideas/argument. \nProduce an outline divided into three with sub-headers along the following lines: \nIntroduction \n(1) Explain what you are being asked to do by the questions and how you intend to \napproach your essay. \n(2) Deal with any matters you have decided not to deal with, giving reasons. \n(3) Give the plan of the argument. \nBody text \n(1) Main argument(s) with evidence (propositions here may need to be backed by con -\nclusions from secondary arguments). \n(2) Secondary arguments with evidence. \nConclusion \n(1) Brief survey of arguments and why they lead to the conclusion reached. You could use the following narrative signposts: \n\n--- Page 329 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 298 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \n‘Therefore having carefully considered arguments 1, 2, 3, etc. … it is possible to \nconclude that …’ \nWriting your essay \nDeveloping your written voice: your writing style \nFor many students, fnding their ‘written voice’ and developing their style is diffcult. When you speak to others you do not have to consider how you might sound or how you should say something: you just know. You automatically change your vocabulary, accent and tone of voice when speaking to different types of people (e.g. a close friend, an acquaintance, your family or your lecturer). However, you may not be so accus -\ntomed to using and changing your written voice. It may be the case that you only write when you are being assessed in coursework or exams. Unlike the informality of emails, texting, instant messaging and social media, formal academic writing is a measured method of communicating, with clear rules of engagement that cover style as well as content. \nAlthough academic writing uses formal structures and expression, you should avoid \nexcessively formal language. Lakoff identifed the concept of hyper-correct language in speakers who resort to long words and archaic terms because they feel uncomfortably out of their comfort zone.\n2 The classic scenario is the witness in court who says: ‘I imme -\ndiately apprehended that the person was moving his arm in my direction with a clenched fst and he made contact with my left cheek towards the area of the chin, and I experi -\nenced a rush of pain. I noted that I had been the victim of a battery!’ This can be most unconvincing heard orally in court and read in its written form. It is better to speak plainly and directly, ‘Then the defendant punched me in the face’. \nLook out for paragraphs where you are repeating phrases or ideas that you might \nhave already used. Repetition in these circumstances suggests a lack of time to properly edit your work. It is a diffcult matter; how many different ways can you say ‘argues’ or ‘states’? \nIf you can eradicate repetition, you will make your writing more cohesive and interesting. Consider using words as substitutions for ‘argues’ and ‘states’, such as: \n  there is an enormous range for him; the key issue is … \n  she views, \n  she considers that, \n  they hold the view that. \nWhen you are comparing authors you can also note whether they agree with each other and when they do not. \nDeveloping your written voice is exceptionally important. After all, it is the medium that \nwill secure your degree. Take as many opportunities to engage in academic writing as possible, getting yourself used to the medium outside the assessment itself. \n2 R Lakoff Language and Woman’s Place (Harper & Row, New York, 1975). \n\n--- Page 330 ---\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n WRITING LAW ESSAYS 299 \nActivity 10.1: fnding your voice3 \n(1) Stop reading now; fnd a piece of paper and pen and start writing about any-\nthing for ten minutes, your favourite football team, your favourite celebrity, etc. \nDo not at this point worry about style or grammar. But do use punctuation. \n(2) When you have fnished do not read over what you have written but put the \npaper to one side and keep on reading this book (or do something else). \n(3) Later today or tomorrow return to the piece you have written. View it objectively, \nnot as the writer of it. Do you consider that what you have read is well written? Evaluate your writing asking the following questions: \nAre there phrases you like or dislike? \nWhat worked and why? What did not work and why? \nAs you have been asked to write about anything you like with no further instruc-\ntion it is likely that you will have adopted an informal style of writing. It will use abbreviations like ‘didn’t’, ‘don’t’, and may include street language or other col-loquialisms. The ‘voice’ you discover will be your informal ‘voice’. \n(4) Keep trying this exercise until you feel comfortable with the idea of writing. You \nshould start to fnd your voice. \n(5) You can have more than one written voice. For academic writing you need to also \ndevelop a formal method of expressing your voice. This will not be too far removed from your informal written voice, but it will need to keep to certain protocols such as not abbreviating. These protocols will be discussed later in this chapter. \nOne way to assess the effectiveness and quality of your writing may be to read it out loud, so you can hear it and gain a different perspective on what you have written. You could record it and listen to it. \nThe requirements of formal academic language \nLegal writing requires the use of formal language, but it must not be too formal. You do not want to fall into Lakoff’s problem of hyper-correctness. We will run through the detail of what it means to be required to use formal language. \nBeing objective \nIn British academic writing, it is conventional to avoid using the words ‘I’ or ‘my’ (contrary to many American academics). Each lecturer has their own preference regarding the word ‘I’, but you cannot go wrong with following the tradition. This will take time to perfect but is \n3 T he idea for this exercise is taken from P Elbow Writing with Power: Techniques for Mastering the Writing \nProcess  (Galaxy books, Oxford University Press, New York, 1981). \n\n--- Page 331 ---\n   \n           \n \n \n \n \n 300 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nwell worth the effort. By objectifying, you in effect describe to the reader what the essay, \nthe object, will do. The technical term for this is using the passive voice. \nInstead of writing the phrase translate your phrase into objective language. This \nrequirement to use objective language when communicating is not just about style. Whilst undergraduate students are expected to develop independent thoughts and views, in academic writing you should only express the views of those with authority (leading scholars and lawyers) on the issue. Any conclusion to your assessments needs to weigh up the academic and legal sources you have used in your argument. In terms of assessed academic writing your own views are not relevant except insofar as you state a preference for one accepted academic opinion over another. It is better to state, ‘This shows that the views of X are supported’ rather than ‘I think the views of X are correct’. \nThere is no reason to be overly careful and modest about expressing your opinion, \nthough. The essay you are submitting is your work and contains your opinion, and you should have some confdence expressing this. There is no need to use phrases like ‘I believe Hanson is right when she writes …’ – go for something like ‘Hanson rightly states …’. \nIf you fnd language and style diffcult, check to see if your university runs academic \nwriting seminars. \nIncorporating the work of others in your writing \nEven when you are communicating the views of others, the language of your writing should not change. Rather than summarising each source separately and pushing it into your argument you need to consider the words used by your source and properly inte -\ngrate your sources into a coherent argument. Here the value of good note taking in the research process is particularly important. Your written voice should be communicating the views of others. \nQuotations must be used in a considered manner. A direct quote will always break \nthe fow of your argument, and should therefore only be used if the exact wording of the quotation is important. Otherwise, it is preferable to use a referenced paraphrase. \nAll too often quotations placed into the text by the writer appear haphazard and hang \nawkwardly in the text, serving no purpose. This often suggests that the student could not be bothered to dissect the ideas in the quote. Often quotes are not grammatically linked to the writing piece and this too makes them read as out of place. You must think about why you want to quote the author. Then embed the quotation so it reads seamlessly in your work: even when you think the quote speaks for itself it has also to be introduced (and explained if necessary). \nUse of language \nGrammar \nYou will probably not be overly excited about this section, and you might even be surprised it is here. Surely, the quality of the work should be judged by the content rather than by \n\n--- Page 332 ---\n    \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  WRITING LAW ESSAYS 301 \nTABLE 10.2 PUNCTUATION SYMBOLS: NAMES, FUNCTIONS AND \nEXAMPLES \nName/Symbol Functions and Examples \nAPOSTROPHES These can denote: \n(’) (1) Contraction:  This joins the two words together to make one word. \nEXAMPLE:  ‘Haven’t you understood? ’ instead of ‘ Have you n ot \nunderstood? ’ \nIts or it’s?: Many people misunderstand when to use ‘its’ and when to use \n‘it’s’. One way to ensure you do not make such a mistake is to understand that it’s is a contraction and stands for ‘it is’. So if ‘it is’ does not ft the sentence, it is appropriate to use its , the possessive. \n(2) Possession:  To show something belongs to somebody or there is \na relationship between them. Placing of the apostrophe changes for singular or the plural noun: • A singular noun has the apostrophe placed before the addition of an ‘s’: e.g. The student’s result was good . (One student.) \n• A plural noun has the apostrophe placed after the addition of an ‘s’: \ne.g. The students’ results were good . (More than one student.) \nEXAMPLE: The dog scratched its neck , NOT  The dog scratched it’s neck . \nYou can clearly see that the addition of ‘it is’ does not make sense in this sentence. \nCAPITAL Use these only for \nLETTERS (UPPER CASE) (1) The frst word in a sentence, e.g. The cat jumped over the dog \n(2) Writing a proper name (place or person name), e.g. Mary went to Rome. \n(3) Writing words that derive from proper names: e.g. Shakespearian, \nEnglish. \nCOMMA (,) The comma aids sense and clarity. It is used to: \n(1) List: Here the comma functions as the word ‘and’. Do not put a comma \nbefore the last item in the list: use ‘and’, e.g. Police, security, lawyers and judges . \n(2) Punctuate relative clauses such as which or whose. \n(3) Split up a complex sentence. \n(4) Insert information. \n(5) Separate words that come after a noun to explain or describe it. \nSEMICOLON (;) This is used to keep parts of the sentence separate when a comma would not suffciently indicate the break, and it is not appropriate to make both parts two separate sentences. A capital letter is not used after a semicolon. E.g. The judge said, ‘Will you get me a copy of the defendant’s psychological profle; also I would like to hear in person from the psychologist and see the full medical report if I may’. \n(Continued ) \n\n--- Page 333 ---\n   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n  \n     302 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nTABLE 10.2 (CONTINUED) PUNCTUATION SYMBOLS: NAMES, FUNC -\nTIONS AND EXAMPLES \nName/Symbol Functions and Examples \nCOLON (:) It can be used to: \n(1) Indicate that it is to be followed by information. E.g. Law has a range of \nsources, for example, case law, legislation and custom . \n(2) Link two clauses, for example, a statement and a list. \n(3) Introduce an explanation to expand/explain/strengthen the preceding \nstatement. \n(4) Introduce an explanation or reinforcement of a preceding statement (a \ndash – may be used instead). \n(5) Introduce a direct formal quote. \nDASH (–) A short line used to separate two words. A break that is less strong than a \nbracket and stronger than a comma: they can be used: \n(1) As a pair separating a phrase from the rest of a sentence. Commas can \nalso be used to do this. \n(2) At the beginning of a list or at the end of the list prior to making a com -\nment about the list. \n(3) To indicate a strong pause that is followed by a strong point. \nEXCLAMATION MARK (!) Use at the end of a sentence or after a word/phrase to indicate: surprise, anger, sorrow, commands, warnings, humour or a contentious statement. E.g. He won 5 million pounds! What!  If your exclamation forms a question, \nuse the exclamation mark. E.g. Is it true, did he win 5 million pounds! \nIn non-academic work it is accepted that you can use one or even several \nexclamation marks ( !!!!)or an exclamation mark plus a question mark. ( Did he!? ) \nNB: However, an exclamation mark is not acceptable in formal academic \nwriting. \nFULL STOP (.) This is used to divide groups of words: \n(‘PERIOD’ IN AMERICAN ENGLISH) (1) A single full stop is used to end a sentence if there is no exclamation or \nquestion mark. (Note that the symbols for both of these include a full stop in their construction =!?) e.g. He was very happy with himself. \n(2) A set of three full stops (ellipsis) is used to indicate that words in an \nextract or quotation have been omitted. e.g. He said, ‘ there is no more \nto be added … it is sad ’. (technically called ‘ellipsis’). \n(3) At the end of abbreviations or after titles in referencing where the rel -\nevant referencing system uses them. \nHYPHEN (-) This is a short line, shorter than a dash, that is inserted between two parts of a word and is used to: \n(1) Create compound words by joining two words that in their own right \ncan be used alone. \n(2) Indicate that the beginning of a word with more than one syllable has been \nunexpectedly separated from the rest of it due to the necessity of a break. \n(Continued ) \n\n--- Page 334 ---\n    \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n   WRITING LAW ESSAYS 303 \nTABLE 10.2 (CONTINUED) PUNCTUATION SYMBOLS: NAMES, FUNC -\nTIONS AND EXAMPLES \nName/Symbol Functions and Examples \nQUESTION Place it at the end of a sentence that is a question. E.g. Why are you \nMARK (?) doing that?  Or put it in round brackets at the end of a sentence/phrase \nto indicate doubt, e.g. ( This is Fisherman’s? ) Bay . When direct speech is \nbeing reported use it at the end of a sentence inside the quotation marks. If \nreporting indirect speech, including a question, put it outside the quotation marks. A short request must be followed by a question mark; for a long request you can use a question mark or full stop. \nQUOTATION These are often a source of confusion and the common rule is: Single \nMARKS (‘ ’) quotation marks (‘ ’) should be used for a frst quotation of direct speech. E.g. Cedric said, ‘ Come on, the way is clear ’. Double quotation marks (“ ”) \nshould be used for: \n(1) Any quotation occurring within a quotation, reporting of indirect \nspeech. ‘Yes you are correct. I heard Cedric say, “Come on, the way is clear” ’. \n(2) Around the titles of poems, articles, radio and television programmes \n(although long titles tend now to be in italics). \n(3) Around words that you wish to indicate that you know are not correct or \nin doubt. E.g. This ‘law’ if it is a ‘law’. \n(4) Punctuation marks come after the closing of quotation marks for \nthe quotation of single words, or incomplete titles, or incomplete quotations. \n(5) Punctuation comes inside quotation marks for other instances (e.g. \ndirect speech). \n(6) If you are quoting within a quote for clarity, the normal convention is to \nuse both types of quotation marks: it does not matter in these circum -\nstances whether the outer set of quotation marks are single or double: e.g. Mary heard Cedric say, ‘So he said “I am here” but I thought that \nwas odd’./Mary heard Cedric say “So he said ‘I am here’ but I thought that was odd”. \nPARENTHESES BRACKETS ( ) / [ ] Round brackets can be used around phrases in a sentence or whole sentences to refer to a reference, or numbers (5), letters (v), or indicate interruptions. You use brackets around that part of a sentence that is not particularly about the subject matter of the sentence. ‘The author Marcus Jones (not his real name) wrote prolifcally’. A sentence adding information to the paragraph but not strictly relevant to what is being discussed can also be put in square brackets. \nthe correct use of adjectives and adverbs? Unfortunately, it does not always work like that. \nThe use of grammar is crucial when expressing your views. A good command of grammar can make your essay more elegant and convincing, whilst a bad command of grammar can in the worst case mislead your reader as to what you are actually trying to say. \n\n--- Page 335 ---\n   \n \n  304 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nUnfortunately, English grammar is not as clear as it is in many other languages, as the \nEnglish language is a mixture of many infuences – German, French, Scandinavian, Latin \nand so on. \nIf you are struggling in this regard, make sure to read up on the topic, and, maybe more \nimportantly, expose yourself to high-quality material – listen to Radio 4, watch the news coverage on the BBC, read a high-quality newspaper, read good literature and so on. \nPunctuation \nThe title of Lynne Truss’ surprise bestseller on the subject of punctuation, Eats, Shoots and Leaves\n4 shows the importance of correct punctuation in a memorable and entertain -\ning manner. She describes the story of a panda who read in a book that a panda: \nEats, shoots and leaves. \nThis led to a tragedy as the panda went into a restaurant, ordered and ate a meal, took out a gun, began shooting and then left. \nThe punctuation was the cause of this drama. The comma was not required after the \nword ‘eats’ and if the entry had read that a panda: \nEats shoots and leaves. \nThis would have told the panda that it was normal for him to eat shoots and leaves. Sense depended on where the comma was placed. \nPunctuation provides a sense for your writing and it is therefore an essential aspect of \nyour written English. If you use punctuation correctly, it will create a good impression of your ability as a writer. It is also important for the purposes of understanding your reading to have a grasp of the foundations of punctuation. \nVocabulary \nMany students are concerned that their vocabulary is too small. You may recall an experi -\nence when you were talking to someone, or in a small group, and you did not understand most of the words you heard although you all spoke the same language. \nYou will need to acquire a large technical legal vocabulary and at the same time extend \nyour ordinary English vocabulary. \nAn initial feeling of being overcome with too many unknown words is a natural frst \nconcern of law students. Do not worry. With persistent application your vocabularies, and therefore your general comprehension of legal texts, will expand. I have used the term ‘vocabularies’ because there is a difference between general and legal English. \n4 L Truss Eats, Shoots and Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation (Profle Books, London, \n2003). \n\n--- Page 336 ---\n    WRITING LAW ESSAYS 305 \nAlso in the study of law you will fnd that many ordinary, general English words will \nhave a specialised meaning within English law. Words such as ‘intention’, ‘negligence’, \n‘recklessness’ and ‘knowingly’ have been the object of much interpretative debate in law cases. At times legislation is enacted to try and clarify the meaning of these words, lead -\ning to more cases about their meaning. \nExtending your general vocabulary \nIn academic life as well as in ordinary life people make unfounded value judgments about us. Because of its link to education vocabulary is routinely used to classify socio-eco -\nnomic status and make assumptions about a language user’s intelligence. Promise your -\nself that you will not just ignore words you do not understand. If you do not understand the meaning of a word how can you know that it is all right to ignore it? An obvious thing that you can do is to keep an alpha ordered vocabulary. You should not assume that because you looked up a word once that you will remember its meaning months later. Ideally it should give the full range of meanings of the word, together with examples of using it in the different vocabularies in which it can occur. Words do change their meaning according to context. As your vocabulary will extend you will be able to use some of this new vocabulary in your academic discussions, or everyday discussions if appropriate. \nAs you concentrate upon extending your vocabulary, whether as a native English \nspeaker or reading English as a second language, you will become aware that many words share the same parts. This knowledge can be used to assist you in understand -\ning new words. Recall the work on affxes and guessing words. But also recall that you should not assume that you have the correct meaning of the word from your guessing; you should also look it up. \nExtending your technical legal vocabulary \nThe meaning of many technical legal words, and the appropriate words to use when referring to certain activities in law, will embed themselves in your memory as you will be using them often. Legal English also resorts to a large number of Latin phrases or tags which stand as shorthand for doctrines and methods of resolving disputes (e.g. obiter , \nratio). These will be considered in more detail in the chapters on legal writing for essays \nand problem solutions. However, you can help yourself to learn this technical vocabulary by keeping an alpha listing of the meaning of such words (or phrases) so that in times of uncertainty about meaning you can just refer to your list. \nIssues with spelling \nThere are many rules and exceptions in English with regard to spelling. Only a few of the more notorious issues are referred to here. Your computer will have a spell checker and it is well worth using it as a preliminary check for mistakes, but do check that it is set \n\n--- Page 337 ---\n   \n 306 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nto British English and not American English. However, do not accept a spelling without \nchecking the computer has correctly understood your use of the word. The computer will fag up certain easily mistaken words (such as their/there) but not all. \nUnderstanding the relationship between sentences and paragraphs \nWe have so far noted the importance of the use of correct grammar, punctuation, vocabu -\nlary and spelling. These all come together in the sentences, phrases and paragraphs that you choose when constructing your academic writing in response to tasks set by your lecturers. To use sentences and paragraphs properly you do need to understand the defnition and function of them both. For your assistance these are set out in Table 10 .3. \nThe frst draft \nAlthough you will have an idea of what you are doing and where you are going and indeed what your answer is, it is a good idea to start your detailed frst draft in the body of the text: \n  Leave the intro at the outline plan stage. \n  Begin with the body text, the middle section, paying particular attention to the devel -\nopment of your main argument – is it supported by evidence? \n  Review everything for your conclusion. \n  Write the fnal version of the introduction last, ensuring that the body of the text and \nyour conclusion do what your introduction says they will do. \n  Then fnalise your conclusion. \n  When you have fnished this, remember it is a draft not the fnal product. Read it through carefully. \n  Ensure that every item referred to is appropriately referenced. \n  If a bibliography is required ensure that it contains all referenced texts and all texts consulted for the essay but not referred to in the text. \n  It is always worthwhile considering whether you need to search for any more texts. So allow time for this and go back and read the question again. As your understand -\ning has developed through reading you may now spot issues in the question that you initially missed. \n  Revise and produce a second draft going through the same steps as above. \n  This time tackle issues of continuity between the introduction and the conclusion. \nThe fnal version \nCarefully review your second draft: \n  Consider whether there is a need to search for any more texts. \n  Pay attention to the argument – does it clearly present itself? \n\n--- Page 338 ---\n    \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n WRITING LAW ESSAYS 307 \nTABLE 10.3 UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF SENTENCES AND PARA-\nGRAPHS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF WRITING \nSENTENCE \nDefnition A sentence is a group of words grammatically linked containing a verb intending \nto communicate something. \nComponents • Verb:  Sentences must have a verb. There can be more than one verb in a \nparts sentence. \n• Subject:  Sentences have a subject which is the word controlling the action \nimplied by the verb. A subject can be a pronoun, noun (a proper name or named concepts) and this can include prepositions such as ‘this’. \n• Object:  Sentences can have an object; again this can be a pronoun or a noun. \n• Sentences can also contain other grammatical units such as adverbs or \nadjectives. \n• Some would maintain that you should not start a sentence with a conjunction \nor words ending with the suffx ‘ing’. \nVerb A verb is a word that discusses actions and states, and it is often referred to as a ‘doing’ or ‘being’ word, e.g. running, happy, etc. A verb has different tenses according to whether it relates to an action or state in the present  (present tense), \nthe past  (past tense) or the future  (future tense). \nThere are other tenses, but you need not concern yourself with these now. The other words used in a sentence must agree with the tense of the verb they are in grammatical relation to. To check your understanding of tenses look at Examples 1 and 2 below. Adjectives and adverbs (as appropriate) joined to verbs in the sentence are indicated by dashes joining these words. Example 1. She loves-to-run but she hated-swimming-when-she-tried it = √ Example 2. She love-to-run  but she hates-swimming-when-she-try  it = X \nSENTENCE \nSubject The subject of a sentence is the main focus of the sentence, what it is about. \nOften, but not always, it comes near the beginning of the sentence and determines the rest of the sentence. Sentences can have more than one subject. e.g. The barrister drafted the pleadings subject verb object \nObject Nouns in a sentence that are not the focus of the sentence are objects as they explain more about the subject and what they may be doing or thinking etc. Sentences can have more than one object. \n• A direct object is an object acted on by the subject, e.g. The police offcer \ncaught the thief. \n• An indirect object is where the object is indirectly affected by the action, e.g. \nThe police offcer gave the thief a drink. \nPARAGRAPH \nDefnition A group of sentences that are connected to each other because they deal with \nthe same idea or point. \nComponent Each paragraph will have a: \nparts • Topic sentence , which is what the paragraph is discussing. \n• ‘Body’ sentences  that give information following on from the topic sentence. \nEach new idea should be introduced in a new paragraph. \n• A Concluding sentence  is to smooth the way for the next paragraph or to \nrefer the reader back to the topic of the paragraph, or both. \nFunction/size Each sentence in the paragraph should make sense in that paragraph; it should not be irrelevant, and sentences should be logically ordered within the sentence. There is no set size for a paragraph but ideally it should not be a page long, nor too small, but on some occasions a two-sentence paragraph may be needed. \n\n--- Page 339 ---\n   \n \n  \n  308 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \n  Pay particular attention to the conclusion and thoughts on the introduction. \n  Review the argument. Is there evidence to back it up? Have opposing views been dealt with? \nThen write the fnal draft: \n  Proofread it carefully for spelling, grammar and word count. \n  Double-check all citations and references. \n  Put it aside for a day if possible or a few hours if not and then carefully re-read and \nmake any fnal changes. \nReferencing your sources \nWhy should I make references? \nWhen you submit work to the university for formal assessment you will be expected to describe, review, compare and critically analyse the work of academics, legal profes -\nsionals and others and to use their work to support your own arguments. The university expects their work to be clearly distinguishable from your own work. To ensure that you can do this consistently and thoroughly you need to know how to reference your uses of the work of others. It is part of the skill of an undergraduate and graduate student that they learn to do this and deploy referencing in a way that enhances their work and their writing. \nSeveral academic referencing systems exist and your university may even have set up \nits own preferred referencing system. The two main referencing systems used in UK law schools are OSCOLA (the Oxford System for the Citation of Legal Authorities), which is known as a footnote system, and Harvard, an in-text system (less used in law schools). This chapter will briefy introduce the referencing protocols for both and make reference to sources where you can fnd more detail. Both referencing systems dictate the way in which references should be signalled inside the body of your text and laid out in detail outside the body of your text (e.g. as footnotes, endnotes, and in a bibliography). \nAs important as proper referencing is for academic work, it is also important not to \noverthink it. Students can get stressed about compliance with the minute details of the referencing system, but nobody is going to fail you if you use square brackets instead of round ones or if you did not put a book’s title in italics. Ultimately, there are only two rules that matter: \n1. References need to guide the reader to the source of the text. \n2. References need to be consistent inside your work. \nA set referencing style helps you achieve all of that without having to think too much. A reader of your essay, who is familiar with your referencing style, will recognise immediately \n\n--- Page 340 ---\n    WRITING LAW ESSAYS 309 \nthat you got that quote from a journal article and will be able to fnd it if they want to. It is \ntherefore always advisable to use an established style, even if your law school leaves the choice up to you. \nA lot of the explanations in this chapter will seem complex and scary, but you can trust \nus: once you are used to referencing, it will become second nature, and you will not have to worry about it anymore! \nWhen should I make references? \nReferences fulfl two tasks: they help you avoid allegations of plagiarism (see below), and they give authority to your arguments. As impressive as your thoughts and opinions prob -\nably already are, it is even more impressive if you can show that other people’s research backs them up. \nWhenever you use the work of another or quote directly from them in your writing, you \nmust reference the source. If an idea has been set out at length in a chapter you will most likely just refer to the relevant chapter. If, however, the idea or argument you wish to use is set out in a few pages, you can just refer to those few pages when you reference. These particular references are referred to as pinpoint references and they enable a reader to fnd the exact location in that other work. If you are indebted to the orientation of an entire book or article then you can consider stating this and noting the full work. \nThe requirement to reference does not stop with verbatim quotations but includes \nideas, diagrams, tables, illustrations and the statistics, which have been respectively designed or collected and interpreted by others. Students often overlook the need to reference every time they refer to a legal rule. For example, if you state ‘it is a criminal offence to steal a book’ you must give the pinpoint reference to the relevant legal prohibi -\ntion (which is, of course, s 1 of the Theft Act 1968). \nIf you are referring to issues discussed by a judge(s) in a case such as the develop -\nment of a legal rule, or a matter of interpretation, you must give the full reference to that case and a pinpoint reference to the exact part of the judgment(s) developing the rule or interpretation. \nTherefore, when you discuss statements of law always ask yourself, ‘What is my \nauthority for stating this?’ then reference that authority. You can also ask yourself whether you wish to summarise the point or use a direct quotation, and more will be said about this later in this chapter. \nMany students speak of statistics in their work without referring to the source, but \nwhere did that statistic come from, and how do we know it is from a reputable academic or empirical source? Would you expect to take action based on unsubstantiated statis -\ntics? Hopefully not – you would want to know the source and then weigh up if it were a reputable source. You must give a reference to the report producing those statistics or to the author of the book or journal that cited such a statistic if they did not give the refer -\nence to the statistic. This latter situation would be a secondary source as you obtained the information from a source using the primary statistics. \n\n--- Page 341 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n    \n \n \n  310 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nWhen you are discussing legal defnitions clearly they have an origin in a source beyond \nyour own work. If they have been defned in case law or legislation, that source must be \ncited. You can cite other sources for defnitions, such as a law dictionary or an article. But this should not be done to the exclusion of referring to the case law and legislation that has defned the legal concept. \nIf you know you have taken existing information from another author, even though you \nhave used your own words to communicate that information, you must still reference your source for your summary. If you are not sure whether to reference or not, play safe and reference. Whilst you can be criticised for over referencing and it could lose you marks for presentation, if you have a genuine dilemma you cannot resolve it is better to err on the side of referencing caution. \nIt is generally considered appropriate not to reference factual information which everyone \nin a particular state or locality should know. This is because it is said to be common knowl -\nedge yet there are no general rules about what constitutes ‘common knowledge’. It is often diffcult to know what to do about referencing information that is said to be ‘common knowl -\nedge’ – that is, a fact everyone should know. For example, if you write who the current prime minister is, do you need to reference it? Do you refer to the results of the last general election from the offcial record? What about a broader non-factual comment? If the information can be found in many places and is indeed known by many people then you need not reference it. But what does ‘many’ mean? If in real doubt it is best to seek advice from your tutors. \nThe OSCOLA system was specifcally developed in the UK to make it easier to deal \nwith references required for primary legal source material. The system is based on foot -\nnotes – small numbers in the text that refer to text at the bottom of the page.\n5 \nHow do I make a footnote? \nThe Word Processor you are using – Microsoft Word, LibreOffce, Openoffce, Google Docs or one of the many others – will have an automatic function for inserting a footnote that takes care of the counting for you. \nThe footnote should usually be placed after the punctuation at the end of the sentence \nyou are referring to.\n6 However, if you are referring to an individual word7 rather than the \nwhole sentence, the footnote should be placed behind the word itself. \nIf you cite multiple sources, you can do this in two ways: \n(1) Twining and Miers,8 Holland and Webb9 and Hanson10 all agree that referencing \nis important. \n(2) Twining and Miers, Webb and Hanson all agree referencing is important.11 \n5 L ike this one. \n6 H ere. \n7 L ike the word ‘words’ in this sentence. \n8 W Twining and D Miers How to Do Things with Rules (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2010). \n9 J Holland and J Webb Learning Legal Rules  (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2019). \n10 S Hanson Learning Legal Skills and Reasoning  (Routledge, London, 2020). \n11 W Twining and D Miers How to Do Things with Rules (Cambridge University Press 2010); J Holland and J Webb Learning Legal Rules  (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2019); S Hanson Learning Legal Skills and \nReasoning  (Routledge, London, 2020). \n\n--- Page 342 ---\n    \n \n \n \n WRITING LAW ESSAYS 311 \nThe frst reference gives the full reference to the source used. If the full reference has \npreviously been given, it is only necessary to refer to your previous footnote. Nowadays, this is done by simply using the authors name and ‘n X’ to show the previous note: Twining and Miers think referencing is important.\n12 In older texts, you will fnd Latin abbreviations \nlike ‘Op. cit.’ ( opere citato  – in the work cited) or ‘Loc. cit.’ ( loco citato  – in the place cited), \nbut these should not be used any more. \nIt is advisable to use automated functions for this as well, like the cross-referencing \nfunction in Microsoft Word. This way the number given in the second footnote is still cor -\nrect, even if you decided to add several footnotes before the frst one later. \nIf you are referring to the footnote directly above, you can use ‘ibid.’, but only for \nthe one directly above. Be careful with this (or avoid it altogether) when writing: once you start editing and moving sentences around, you might not be sure what the ‘ibid.’ referred to. \nReferencing primary source material \nWhat is a legal citation? \n‘Citation’ is a general term for the referral to all primary legal sources – like statutes, case law or other legal statements. \nUK cases \nThere are two types of citation used for UK cases, the neutral citation and law report citation. They are completely independent of each other except for the fact that they both refer to a written record of the same law case. \nThe neutral citation \nThis is the referencing system of the courts and is given to all cases post-2001. This includes the year, territorial jurisdiction and a sequence number, which denotes which judgment it is in that year in the relevant area (e.g. civil or criminal law), e.g. [2004] EWCA Civ 727 denotes that this citation is to the 727th judgment in the England and Wales Court of Appeal for the year 2004. The Supreme Court has UK wide jurisdiction and is denoted by the UKSC, United Kingdom Supreme Court. \nThe private report citation \nThe second type of citation is used for privately reported cases. This private law report citation will set out the year of the case, title of the law report, volume details and the page number for the frst page of the report. Where there is no neutral citation in existence for the reported case because it is pre-2001, the court is given at the end of the citation in abbreviated form enclosed in brackets, R v Moloney [1985] 2 AC 905 (HL). \n12 Twining and Miers (n 8). \n\n--- Page 343 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 312 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nFor all references to private law reports you must give the neutral citation frst (if there \nis one) followed by the references to the private report(s) of the case in order of their hierarchy of authority, R v Bree [2007] EWCA Crim 804; [2008] QB 131; [2007] 3 WLR 600; [2007] 2 All ER 676; [2007] 2 Cr App R 13. \nCiting UK cases \nWhen dealing with cases the citation refers to the name of the parties, the year of the case and if it is not reported the neutral citation giving court and number of the case in the year. If it is reported, then it includes details of the private report (report title, volume number if any and page number). You may like to think of your law case citation as divided into two parts, the names of the parties, and the citation for its location. Each of these is inserted into the text in a different but connected way. \nOSCOLA specifes that only the name of the case in italics with the superscript numeral \nshould be put in the body of your text. It is the matching footnote that contains the cited location of the case. By way of example, one can point to the case of R v Bree .\n13 Note that \nthe superscript marker immediately after R v Bree directs you to footnote 13, which, as you can see, gives the citations for the reports where it can be located, beginning with the neutral citation, followed by other reports in accordance with the hierarchy of law reports. \nConventions for shortening names of parties in civil law \nIn the body of your text you may not wish to set out the full case name, and this is fne. But you need to use the conventional shortening not make one up. The rule is that you can only use the surname of the frst party in the action as an abbreviation. It is important to have such a rule as the shortening of case names is common, and matters will be unduly complicated if different methods prevail. What is less easy to get used to is that customarily some famous leading cases will always be referred to by resort to both party names, and others are conventionally shortened to the frst party. You will just have to get used to these. \nAn interesting example is the case of McAlister (or Donoghue) v Stevenson  [1932] AC \n562. This is a famous civil law case in the area of the law of tort (the law relating to acci -\ndents). In the text this case is always referred to as Donoghue v Stevenson  and rarely \nreferred to as Donoghue . Note too that the frst of the two named parties, McAlister, is again \nonly rarely referred to in the text. If you were writing about negligence as developed within the law of tort and you decided to shorten this case to Stevenson , no one would necessarily \nknow the case you were referring to. If you somewhat exceptionally referred to ‘Donoghue’s case’, most people would know the case but feel that the shortening used was incorrect. \nWhen the second name is rather long and the frst party has a shorter name there will \nbe a natural use of the frst name only which then becomes common usage. For example, the case of Black-Clawson International v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg  [1975] AC \n591 is unsurprisingly referred to orally and in the body of text as ‘ Black-Clawson ’, with \n13 [2007] EWCA Crim 804; [2008] QB 131; [2007] 3 WLR 600; [2007] 2 All ER 676; [2007] 2 Cr App R 13. \n\n--- Page 344 ---\n    \n  \n \n \n \n  WRITING LAW ESSAYS 313 \nParty names in Italic s \nTwo names indicate \nthis is acivil case Volume Number of report \nThere is no neutral cita\u0005on \nas case predates 2001 \nPage number for \nfrst page o f report \nAdler v George [1964] 2 QB 7 (QB) \nCourt name hearing the case: \nQueen’s Bench as \ncase predates neutral cita\u0005ons \nwhich gives the cour t \nDate of publica\u0005on of law repo rt \nName of public a\u0005on producing the reports. \nThis is from t he ICLR: Law R eport Series: \nQueen’ s Bench                                                            \nFigure 10.2 Example reference 1: Adler v George [1964] 2 QB 7 (QB) \n‘International ’ usually being dropped as well. When you are using cases in coursework \nyou will of course be familiar with the area and the standard abbreviations of the names \nof the parties in the cases that you are dealing with. \nConventions for shortening names of parties in criminal law \nWhen charged with an offence and subsequently indicted in court the offender is referred to as the defendant. It is the defendant who has committed a crime against the public and is therefore answering to the state for his or her actions. At one time the local police com -\nmissioner was the formal prosecuting authority, and the frst-named party; however, now that the monarch is the formal head of state, it is used to denote the prosecuting authority and is the frst-named party to the case. Monarch is used in its generic Latin formulation of Regina (for Queen) or Rex (for King). \nCan shortened names be used in your footnote citation? \nYou will think it tedious perhaps, but the standard rule is that the full reference should be used each time a footnote reference is required. This includes the full reference to the names of the parties. The only formal way around this, if you have already cited the full \n\n--- Page 345 ---\n   \n \n  314 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nAgain you will note that this reference has no punctua\fon, except for a semi-colon dividing \nthe neutral cita\fon, [2004] EWCA Civ 727, from the law report cita\fon, [2005] Fam 1 \nThe neutral cita\u0013on (case post 2001) \nDate Jurisdic\u0013on Court Type of ac\u0013on Sequence \nEngland & Wales Court of Appeal Civil number \nParty names \nIn Italics \nEvans v Amicus Healthcare Ltd [2004] EWCA civ 727; [2005] Fam 1 \nNames of par\fes \nYear date of publica\u0013on of law report \nPage number for commencement \nof report \nAbbreviated name of Law Report \nThis is from the ICLR: Law Report Series: Family \nThe private law report cita\u0011on No court name given in brackets because \nneutral cita\u0013on\ngives \ncourt.

If a case report has \na popularised name by which it is always known, and one that is not just a simple use of a frst-named party, then you can use the full citation of the parties’ names in the frst full reference, placing the popularised name in brackets immediately after. The next time you reference you may use the shortened more popular name. \nIf there are several reports of the case you are referencing, you could refer to all reports \nin your reference; however, there is no need to do this as it is suffcient to refer to the most authoritative report according to the hierarchy of reporting. \nPinpoint referencing using cases \nWhen using cases and referencing you may wish to directly quote what a judge has said in the body of your text. In this situation you will need to supply a pinpoint reference, as \n\n--- Page 346 ---\n    \n                                         \n     \n \n                             \n  WRITING LAW ESSAYS 315 \nwell as decide what you put in the body of the text, where you should place the super -\nscript marker and the format of the reference for your footnote. \nThe convention for referencing a verbatim quotation from a judgment remains rela -\ntively consistent. If the case is reported you should only quote from the most authoritative \nlaw report. Place the text marker for the footnote at the end of the quotation or after the introduction of the judge in the quotation. \nThe general rule for the verbatim quotation of text holds for quotes from law cases, \nreports, texts or any other form of text. A short quotation of two or three lines can be inte -\ngrated into the text with the use of quotation marks. A longer quotation of over three lines must be indicated by an indentation in the text, allowing the quoted text to stand proud of the rest of the body text. There is no need for quotation marks in that case as the position of the text makes clear it is a verbatim quotation. \nReferencing secondary sources \nUsing the OSCOLA guide \nOSCOLA has slightly different conventions on how to reference secondary sources. The way a footnote for a book is supposed to look is slightly different from the one for a journal article or for a chapter in an edited book. The best thing for this is to download (and pos -\nsibly print) the quick reference guide on the website of the University of Oxford: \nhttps://www.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/fles/oxlaw/oscola_4th_edn_hart_2012quickreferenc \neguide.pdf and to use it while you are making your references. The quick reference guide will cover most – if not all – sources you are using, but if you need to refer to less com-monly used sources (e.g. Hansard or Scottish Law Commission Reports, there is a full guide, also available free at www.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/fles/oxlaw/oscola_4th_edn_hart_ \n2012.pdf). \nAs mentioned before, all of this will become second nature once you have made the \nfrst few references. \nPinpointing references \nThere are different types of reference that you may wish to make; for example, you may wish to: \n  Give a direct reference from the text you are reading – a verbatim quotation – here a \npinpoint page reference is always required. \n  Give an indirect reference – mentioning the author by name when a pinpoint refer -\nence may be required but not always. \n  Give a specifc reference to a viewpoint or argument which does not name the author when the reference is given to the author. If several authors of different texts are to be named, they are separated by a semicolon. \n\n--- Page 347 ---\n   \n 316 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nWhen referencing, you may wish to refer to the entire book or just pinpoint one or more \npages. If you want to refer to a specifc page or pages, then the page number is incorpo -\nrated into the footnote after the bracket closing the main reference for a book: \nYou can never underestimate the power of the word and the role of the library in the \nstudy of law. \nThe key tools of the trade of the law student are found in the library, in the millions of words that constitute the body of the law and the millions of words that have been used to talk about the law.14 \nThe bibliography \nThe OSCOLA system of referencing does not require a bibliography. However, if your lecturer requires a bibliography at the end of your work, you need to prepare one, and it must include all references to source materials that you have consulted in preparing your written work, including those that you did not specifcally refer to by name in your work. This bibliography must be in alphabetical order using headings to separate academic texts, law cases and legislation. \nTo ensure proper alphabetical order in the bibliography, you will need to begin with \nthe last name rather than the frst: ‘Hanson, S’ instead of the ‘S Hanson’ you used in the footnote. \nHow do I use in-text citations? \nIn law schools, the usual way to make references is via footnotes as described above. In some rare cases, however, law schools might prefer in-text citation systems such as the Harvard or Chicago Style. This is the standard in social science departments, and students on combined degrees (e.g. law and politics) or students who take modules from another department (e.g. from criminology) will almost certainly come across this refer -\nencing style. \nThere are some differences as to the details, but the basic idea is to use the author’s \nname and the year of publication to identify the work and to give a detailed bibliography at the end. The year is usually followed by the page where the referred part is to be found, depending on the style denoted by either ‘:’ or ‘p.’, and the author’s name can be in or outside the brackets to make the text easier to read: \nYou need to be careful using material available online (Hanson 2016: 131).\n Hanson (2020: 131) holds that online materials need to be treated with caution. \nIf you are using two publications by the same author, you need to use small letters to pinpoint which one you mean: ‘Hanson (2020a: 131)’ and ‘(Hanson 2020b: 15)’. \n14 S Hanson Legal Method, Skills and Reasoning  (3rd edition, Routledge-Cavendish, London 2010), 42. \n\n--- Page 348 ---\n    \n          WRITING LAW ESSAYS 317 \nThere are no real conventions for citing cases and legislation in in-text styles, but it is \nusually acceptable to use the OSCOLA standard for this. \nAvoiding plagiarism \nFailure to meticulously reference your work can leave you open to an allegation of plagia -\nrism. Plagiarism is the act of passing off as your own the work of another (e.g. their ideas, \narguments, descriptions, critiques, statistics and illustrations). \nThe exact defnitions differ from university to university, but the basic defnition is \nalways ‘using someone else’s work without acknowledging that’. This means that you need to be careful with your referencing and indicating your quotations. If you have done these properly, you have nothing to fear! \nA fnding of plagiarism has serious consequences for students and can jeopardise \nyour degree programme. Accidental plagiarism, due to careless note taking leading to lack of appropriate referencing, as well as intentional plagiarism, will be pursued by the university, although penalties will usually differ. But for law students there are other seri -\nous consequences. The legal professional bodies require universities to inform them if there has been a fnding of plagiarism. This fnding can be taken as evidence of a lack of good character and can therefore potentially have a negative impact on your future employment prospects and even your entry into the legal profession. \nExperience shows that plagiarism often comes from desperation or lack of under -\nstanding rather than from bad intentions. However, the sanctions will be the same. If life makes studying hard (illness, family problems, work-related issues, etc.), make sure to talk to your tutor early on. Some of this could be grounds for an extension (depending on the policies of the University), but none of this is a valid excuse for plagiarism. Even if you cannot be granted an extension, it is much better to submit a bad piece of work and receive a bad mark than to submit a plagiarised piece of work and risk the end of the legal career before it even began. \nSubmitting your essay \nProofreading \nIt is essential that you read the essay before submitting it. Not only to spot errors the automatic spell checker will not pick up (the word ‘pubic’ appears in more public law essays than you might think!), but also to ensure that you communicate effectively with your reader. \nEven better than proofreading yourself is to give the essay to a friend or a family mem -\nber and ask them if your argument makes sense. Obviously, you know your own argu -\nments, and you know what the essay is supposed to say. A critical friend is able to point out that, for example, the second section comes out of nowhere or that you never really explain that crucial point your conclusion relies upon. \n\n--- Page 349 ---\n   318 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \nQuestions you or your friend should ask about the work include: \n  Can I follow the argument? \n  Is there a fow to the language and to the ordering of points? \n  Is there well-referenced evidence for the points made? \n  Are the arguments organised well and structured in the right order? \n  Are the transitions from argument to argument logical and explained? \n  Is there anything that confuses me? \n  Does every new idea get a new paragraph? \nPresentation \nStudents often neglect the presentation aspect of written work. In addition to fnding your \nvoice, understanding the correct use of grammar, punctuation and spelling and refning your writing style, you should always allow time to edit and format your work. Make sure you read carefully for spelling, punctuation, grammar and fow of your work through para -\ngraphs. In addition, follow your department’s conventions on referencing and formatting. Your law department may require a certain font or line spacing to be used, and if you have to submit a paper copy, it might dictate whether you should only use one side of your paper. \nIf you have a free choice of font, choose one that is easy to read (this will keep your \nmarker relaxed and happy). A font size of 12 is recommended as 14 tends to be too big and 10/11 too small. Keep your line spacing to 1.5 or 2 lines, as this again makes reading easier. Justifed alignment also helps the reader. \nCases and statutes should be formatted in order to make them stand out. Conventionally \nthe names of cases are italicised, for example: R v Briggs  [1977] 1 WLR 605. \nIt is important, however, that you fnd out what your department requires and follow \nthose specifcations. \nBe consistent in your use of headings and how they are displayed in your work and \nensure that you number all of your pages. Only use headings if your essay is quite long, they assist with clarity and your lecturer has no objection to their use. \nCONCLUSION \nThis chapter tried to summarise the complex world of academic legal writing into rela -\ntively few pages, but hopefully it helps to give you an understanding of the different pro -\ncesses involved in writing. \nIt is important that you spend some time thinking about your writing skills and your \nwriting style early on in your studies. As a law student and as a lawyer, language is the main tool you are going to use for the rest of your career, so improving it is always worth \n\n--- Page 350 ---\n    WRITING LAW ESSAYS 319 \nthe effort. Think about your style, and read up on grammar and punctuation to ensure you \ncan avoid any mistakes in this regard. \nWhen you start writing, make sure to choose your question carefully and to plan your \nessay before you start writing. You should always have a clear structure that is directed towards convincing the reader of your argument – even if you do not use headings in your essay (if it is too short), you should have headings in your head when you are putting the essay together. \nAnd make sure to understand the rules and regulations on referencing and plagiarism. \nTo support your argument with legal authority, you need to point your reader towards that authority, and you need to be clear about what part of the work is your own and what is taken from somewhere else. \nFinally, invest at least a little bit of time to polish your essay before submitting it. \nProofreading and formatting are essential to ensure the goodwill of your reader. \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  Whatever type of essay or problem question you are dealing with, the same type of information base is required for all questions. It is how this information, knowl -\nedge and understanding is drawn on to produce a particular written result that is important. \n  The order in which you make your points is part of the effective communication of your ideas in writing. \n  Following standard methods for the preparation and construction of essay or prob -\nlem question answers can help you effectively order the different tasks involved. \n  Find your written academic ‘voice’ and avoid hyper-correct language. \n  Formal academic writing is a measured method of communicating, with clear rules of engagement that cover style as well as content. \n  Eradicate repetition and make your writing more cohesive and interesting. \n  Adopt an objective style and avoid using the words ‘I’ or ‘my’ in your writing. \n  Ensure that you use the correctly referenced work (words, designs and ideas) of oth -\ners in your writing. \n  Make sure you proofread carefully for errors of spelling, punctuation and grammar, as well as for the fow of your work through paragraphs and follow your department’s conventions on referencing. \n  Most coursework will have word limits imposed and there may be penalties for exceeding them. Work out before  you even start writing how many pages of your \ntyping that amounts to. \n  Not only must verbatim (direct) quotations from work be referenced but so must all summaries indebted to a particular author or authors. \n\n--- Page 351 ---\n   320 WRITING LAW ESSAYS \n  Your university may stipulate a particular system of referencing and if this is the case \nyou must follow it. \n  Plagiarism is using the work of others without referencing it. \n  A fnding of plagiarism, even accidental plagiarism, can seriously affect your studies. \n  A law student is particularly affected as all incidents of plagiarism must be reported to the law professional bodies and can be looked upon as potential unftness of char -\nacter for the legal profession. \n  Good referencing means that you will not accidentally plagiarise. \n  Well written work requires an effective written voice, excellent grammar and appro -\npriate choices of words. \n  The referencing, formatting and presentation of your written work is as important as your grammar, spelling and punctuation and the vocabulary you use. \n\n--- Page 352 ---\n11 \n  \n ANSWERING LEGAL \nPROBLEM QUESTIONS \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Be aware of the approach to be adopted for writing solutions to legal problem \nquestions. \n  Develop greater confdence in your ability to tackle a problem question. \n  Be able to structure a solution to a problem question effectively. \n  Increase your understanding of the way in which the skills of general study, research, legal analysis, argument construction and writing skills work together to produce competent problem solutions. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-14  \n\n--- Page 353 ---\n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 322 ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS \nINTRODUCTION \nThis chapter considers strategies for writing answers to problem questions. Students tend to prefer essays to problem solution questions. However, the fact is that the same general information is required for essays and problem solutions. A problem solution tests whether you understand a particular area of law well and can apply it. So you need to understand the relevant area of law well frst. \nThe structure of essays and solutions to problem questions do differ. Additionally, \nwhile essays require academic texts as their foundational proofs for all arguments for -\nwarded, problem solutions primarily require the use of legal rules as the foundational texts. That is not to say that essays do not refer to legal rules but that these are not the fnal proofs in an academic legal argument for an essay. \nTo produce competent written answers to problem questions you need to have a good \nunderstanding of the way in which series of cases have developed areas of law, and how judgments by senior judges are of relevance in the development of legal argument. You also need to appreciate the relationship between legislation and cases and the role of statutory interpretation by the judiciary. If these matters are frmly understood, you will be able to tackle a problem question confdently clearly demonstrating that understanding in the structure and content of your answer. Additionally marks are awarded for use of a correct method for problem solution, as well as the correct outcome. \nA problem question at the academic stage of education is a fctitious legal dispute \ninvariably drafted in such a way as to raise situations where there are conditions of doubt about facts, legal issues, or the interpretation of the law. The student will be asked to discuss the legal liability of one particular party, or all potential parties to the dispute. Using only the information given in the problem question as their guide, the student is required to identify, discuss and apply relevant legal rules to the issues raised by the problem question. Students are required to not only identify specifc breaches of law but to be aware of any applicable defences and/or interpretational issues attached to the law. \nYou are expected to only refer to legal rules which invariably involve the discussion of \nlaw cases and refer to statements by judges in court. You are not expected to refer to aca -\ndemic articles and textbooks, unless the judges in specifc cases have referred to those articles or books in court (which is unlikely – but possible in certain defned situations). Books and articles can exceptionally be drawn upon if an aspect of the problem solution has been written about and never discussed by senior judiciary. \nThe problem question is raised in the context of one particular area of study and tests \nthe student’s awareness of current law, their ability to carefully analyse information they have been given and their competency in the construction of arguments, applying that law as they discuss the problem question and the issues it raises. Problem questions are often set in areas of doubt, so always be wary if you think the answer to the problem is simple and clear cut. \n\n--- Page 354 ---\n     \n \n \n ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS 323 \nProblem questions bring together all of the skills of research, argumentation, critical \nanalysis and application of law and demonstrate more than any other type of assessed \ntask your aptitude for the legal profession. A key skill is also to retain the ability to see the problem from all sides, engaging in analogic reasoning, to check that you are aware of the potential arguments that can be put forward by all parties. \nProblem questions bring the student very close to the work of a practising lawyer, as \ntheir job is to assist in resolving their clients’ legal problems. Trial Judges listen to lawyers’ arguments, and their job is to make a determination of liability to resolve the legal dispute. Developing problem-solving skills helps you to develop your overall legal reasoning skills. You examine facts given to you, locate relevant legal rules and apply them to the facts to suggest ways of determining issues of legal liability. \nTable 11 .1 sets out two typical problem questions for you to get an idea of the way in \nwhich they can be structured. \nAs you can see from reading these questions they can vary in length and the complex -\nity of facts presented. Question 1 presents relatively complex facts in terms of partici -\npant’s names, actions and the timing of occurring events over a very short time frame of a few hours initially and then occurring over a few weeks. It is also quite long and there is quite a lot of information to consider. Question 2 by contrast is short and divided into two parts, and the overall timescale of the facts given is seven days. \nOften fact scenarios may seem clearly unrealistic, and you may feel that these events \nsimply would not happen in the ‘real’ world. The person setting the problem is aware of this; it is merely a vehicle to get you to discuss legal issues and display your understand -\ning and ability to engage in the correct methodology for answering a problem question. \nWhat range of skills are tested and developed by problem questions? Problem questions are specifcally designed to test your developing abilities to \nresearch, handle and apply legal rules and construct legal arguments according to English legal reasoning protocols. Your ability to competently answer problem questions is affected by the development of your skills of general academic study, legal reasoning, as well as your developing skills specifc to problem solutions. We will briefy list the sub-skills involved. \nGENERAL ACADEMIC STUDY SKILLS \n  Independent study and time management. \n  Library research skills. \n  General reading skills. \n  General writing skills (includes language usage in terms of vocabulary, grammar, punctuation and referencing). \n  Referencing primary legal source material.  Citing law cases \n It is essential to note: \n\n--- Page 355 ---\n    \n  \n  \n  324 ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS \nTABLE 11.1 TWO SPECIMEN PROBLEM QUESTIONS \nQuestion 1 \nCliff and Norm spend the evening drinking in their usual bar. Cliff offers Norm a lift home in his \ncar, assuring Norm that he will be okay to drive as he is ‘probably only just over the drink-drive limit’. On the journey home Cliff takes a corner too fast and crashes the car. The paramedics who arrive at the scene fnd that Norm has broken his arm but otherwise only has minor cuts and bruises. Norm is taken to hospital to be checked by a doctor and have his arm placed in a cast. At the hospital Norm is seen by Diana, the doctor on duty. Diana disagrees with the paramedics’ opinion on Norm’s arm and, deciding it is not broken but only sprained, puts it in a sling, without setting it in a cast. As she was so busy that evening, she decided not to bother sending him for an X-ray frst. Norm returns to hospital the following month with pain in his arm. It transpires that his arm was in fact broken and, because it was not set in the proper cast, the bones have fused together wrongly, resulting in a permanent disability. An expert consultant orthopaedic surgeon says that there was a chance this might have happened anyway, even if Diana had not been negligent. Norm has to have an operation to try and reset the bones, but this will not improve his arm to the condition it was in before the accident. A week later Norm is knocked down by a speeding motorist who fails to stop and cannot be traced. His right arm is so badly injured that it has to be amputated. Advise Norm in relation to any claims in negligence he may bring. \nQuestion 2 Cedric, a dealer in marble, has a 2kg quantity of rare green Ionian marble for sale. He has \ndone business with Dorothy, a collector of fne green Ionian marble for fve years. She normally pays £250 a kilo. He emailed her last Tuesday, asking if she would be interested in buying the marble. Dorothy emailed back within 15 minutes saying, ‘Yes I will buy the 2kg of the green marble for the usual price of £500. If I hear nothing to the contrary I will consider it mine and bring the money (in cash), and collect it next Monday’. Cedric reads the email but does not reply to it. Advise Dorothy as to her legal position in the following two situations: \n(a) Cedric sells the 2kg of green marble to Timothy for £750.00 on Friday. \n(b) Cedric puts the 2kg of green marble in a box labelled ‘Marble for Dorothy £500 to pay, for \ncollection and payment Monday’. Dorothy decided she did not want the marble after all and so she did not go to Cedric’s on the next Monday. In the meantime Cedric lost out on a sale to Timothy who offered £750 for it on Friday. \n○ The court (Court of Appeal CA, Supreme Court). \n○ The names of judges giving important judgments in cases (which can be \nmajority or dissenting or minority). \n Citing legislation  ensuring you always refer to sections, sub-sections, para -\ngraphs or sub-paragraphs as relevant. \n\n--- Page 356 ---\n     \n \n ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS 325 \n Cases and legislation should be in italics or underlined so they are clearly visible \nin the text. \nFootnotes or endnotes (depending on your law school’s preferred referencing system) must be used to give the full citations of cases, and to give any quite relevant but not absolutely ‘on point’ comments. However, footnotes/endnotes are not expected in exami -\nnation conditions. You could, for example, use brackets in texts to indicate such matters. Nor are you expected to know page numbers, for example, in exams, just the name of the case, the court and the year of the case. \nLegal reasoning skills \n  Understanding legal argument construction and being able to construct a good argument backed by evidence. \n  Competent use of methods of legal reasoning according to the doctrine of precedent. \n  Understanding the relationship between cases and legislation. \nSkills relating to legal problem solution \n  Factual organisation of a problem scenario usually with complex sets of dates, tim -\nings, actions, and multiple participants. \n  Identifcation of the legal issue or issues raised by the given factual scenario. \n  Knowledge of the law in a given area (e.g. criminal law, law of contract, law of tort) so that you can identify legal issues relating to liability and any issues relating to defences. \n  Understanding of any interpretational doubts or gaps about the law revealed by decided cases in the area under consideration. \n  Ability to handle and apply case law and legislation to a problem. \n  The ability to manage and classify the given facts in a problem question and system -\natically apply the law to those facts. \nMETHODS FOR THE PREPARATION AND CONSTRUCTION \nOF ANSWERS TO PROBLEM QUESTIONS \nThe key to answering a problem question successfully lies in spotting the ‘clues’ to the \nlegal issues to be discussed. Primarily the clues are in the facts you have been given in the problem. It is for you to apply your legal understanding to the facts and extract the issues. But also many of these clues are purely linguistic and organisational. You need to carefully consider any signposting words such as prepositions, or the use of any dates and times that may need to be unravelled and understood within the context of the set problem. You also need to be able to make reference to actions that need to be carefully considered. \n\n--- Page 357 ---\n    \n \n 326 ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS \nAt root in a problem question you are dealing with: \n  A fctitious fact situation involving a dispute disclosing legal issues that may result in \nlegal liability being allocated to one or more of the participants in the factual scenario. \n  Legal rules that need to be found, interpreted and applied to those legal issues. \n  Prediction of whether a particular social actor is likely to be legally liable for actions disclosed in the problem scenario. \nIdeally what should be happening as you read your problem question is that certain facts, or groups of facts, should trigger reminders of cases with similar facts, which you can then seek out. \nMethods for writing solutions to problem questions \nThere are several methods recognised for outlining the issues that need to be dealt with in problem questions. The key skill is to adopt one technique and then methodically fol -\nlow it through. As you gain experience you will fnd the method easier to use and your understanding of the analysis of legal problems will become more sophisticated. Once you have perfected your preferred technique you can use it for all problem questions in all of your subjects throughout your legal studies and beyond into a legal career. Table 11 .2 \nsets out four suggested methods. In fact they are all similar and Column 1, the description column, notes a four-stage general approach. The last column gives an idea of how the four stages translate into a standardised structure for your written answer. \nTHE FOUR GENERAL STAGES OF PROBLEM SOLUTION METHODOLOGY \nWe will now go through each of the four generalised stages in Column 1 of Table 11 .2 to \ngive you an idea of the matters to be discussed and action you can take to help you clarify issues. Until each stage is completed you cannot begin to determine the content of each part of the structure to your answer. \nStage 1: identifcation of the legal issues arising \nfrom the facts in the problem question \nSeveral sub-stages are involved here as follows: \nIdentifcation of all relevant facts given in the problem question \nThe key here is your meticulous attention to detail as you read the problem question. If \nyou misunderstand the facts due to a careless reading, you will also fail to pick up rel -\nevant legal issues.

Before this can be completed you need to engage in a careful reading of the problem question, extract the facts and through your factual analysis determine the legal issues, and through careful research determine relevant rules. STAGE 2:identif cation of all relevant legal rules RULE PRINCIPLE LAW LEGAL RULE \nSTAGE 3:application ofrelevant legal rules to the legal issues identif ed (includingthose relating to any \ndefence or mitigation\nand discussion of any interpretational doubts concerningrelevant legal rules) APPLICATION APPLICATION EVALUATION APPLICATION 2. The main body of the answer:The methodical deployment of your argument by setting out each legal issue separately and applying legal rules to it. Discussing likelihood of the applicability of any defences or mitigation. If more than one party is being discussed each issue and any defence etc. should be dealt with separately for each party. A key issue is the order in which you decide to lay out your argument in terms of primary and secondary issues. This uses the material collected at Stages 1 and 2. Every point argued must be supported by available evidence. If no evidence is available the inferences must be clearly stated and your rationale for those inferences. Here you deploy your detailed legal analysis of the matters raised.\nSTAGE 4:your determination of liability based on your prediction of the likely application of the law CONCLUSION CONCLUSION OUTCOME NOTE\nOUTCOME 3. The conclusion:Drawing out the conclusions in the main body you give your f nal likely determination of liability in relation to those parties you have been asked to discuss. This should be consistent with the matters raised in your introduction, and the arguments pursued in the main body of your text. \n\n--- Page 359 ---\n    \n 328 ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS \npass the assessment. The facts will vary in terms of their relevance. Again you need to \nmake judgments about these matters based on your understanding of the law. For exam -\nple, in a shoplifting case, the fact it is heavily raining may well not be a relevant fact, but it would be highly relevant in a dangerous driving prosecution. \nYou may fnd a simple fow chart of the facts and their ordering helps you to grasp \nthe issues; you can then place cases, etc. beside facts. This can be extremely helpful in allowing you to identify all relevant issues. \nIdentifcation of the primary and secondary legal issues raised by the facts \nYou have to ascertain this from the information and facts of the problem. This is part of the skill of answering problem questions. You will locate the law by going over your lecture notes, revisiting any relevant seminar work, reading sections in your textbooks, and read -\ning the full text of relevant cases. \nIt is unwise to assume that all that you identify on a frst reading (before engagement \nwith Stage 2 location of legal rules and other wider reading) is the sum total of the issues to be discussed. As you develop your understanding of the law you may well fnd that more legal issues become apparent. \nChecking the capacity of the defendant or a litigant to be held liable \nIssues of age and mental awareness, for example, can lead to a situation in which the law holds that a given defendant does not have the required capacity to be held liable for a breach of law. \nStage 2: identifcation of all relevant legal rules \nDetermine the relevant legal rules relating to any breach of law \nThis will involve wider reading in textbooks as well as researching cases and legisla -\ntion; the more careful your research, the greater your understanding of the issues will become. \nStage 3: application of relevant legal rules \nto the legal issues identifed \nCarefully consider doubts/interpretational issues and ask yourself \nwhat you consider to be the appropriate response to them \nProblem questions usually involve issues relating to uncertainty or gaps in the law. You \nneed to locate these, research them, read secondary legal texts as well as the law itself, and read relevant primary case law carefully. Then form a view based on existing law and predicted application of law in relation to those doubts or gaps \n\n--- Page 360 ---\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS 329 \nDiscussion of applicable defences/mitigation \nThere are general defences to a range of breaches of civil and criminal law, as well \nas defences that are specifc to given circumstances and breaches. You need to be aware of these when you are considering the answer to a problem question and explain the breach, or provide an accepted legal recognition of the act leading to the breach. In addition there may be certain information that the court can be asked to consider, for example, specifc circumstances existing at the time of the breach that may lead the court to lower damages awarded against a litigant or a sentence imposed on a defendant. \nDecide the order in which you will discuss your identifed legal issues. \nStage 4: your determination of liability based on your \nprediction of the likely application of the law \nConsider the strength of arguments for and against each point raised for answer and \ncome to your view. \nTHE STRUCTURE OF YOUR FINAL WRITTEN ANSWER \nIt is important to develop a clear layout for your problem solution so that your arguments can be followed, and there is no danger of you forgetting to discuss an important issue. Obviously, all sources must be appropriately referenced according to the system required by your department or in the absence of a departmental preference according to the system you prefer. Additionally you must seek to continue to develop a good third party voice for your written work. These general matters have been discussed in detail in earlier chapters. \nWhen all of the matters in Stages 1–4 have been investigated and resolved to your \nsatisfaction your answer needs to be carefully formatted and structured. The standard structure for this is set out in the last column of Table 11.2 and will be familiar to you from \nessay structure: (1) the introduction, (2) the main body of the answer and (3) the conclu -\nsion. Each of these will be discussed in turn, as the detail of each part of the structure is different to that for an essay. \n(1)Introduction \nYour introduction needs to make clear what legal issues are raised by the problem and how you will approach them. If the problem discloses more than one potential issue of liability then these must be discussed separately. It is far too easy to make a mistake and forget something if you discuss everything together. It is also quite easy in these circum -\nstances to confuse the marker of your work too. \n\n--- Page 361 ---\n    330 ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS \nIf you are discussing separate potential issues of liability, it is also important to note any \ndefences separately. However, do not be tempted to engage in an essay-style debate. A \nproblem question requires a straightforward layout of legal issues and liability. Discussion of irrelevancies is therefore liable to be taken as a sign of confusion on the part of the student or lack of knowledge. \n(2) Main body: the worked out answer to the problem question \nThis is where your legal argument is laid out in detail, and each proposition backed with evidence if possible. Where the law is extremely uncertain it may be acceptable to refer to arguments in textbooks or articles, but your main proof must be the law and its inter -\npretation by the courts. This part of your answer may contain headings and sub-headings as appropriate for different heads of liability. It is certainly a good idea if the problem question involves several breaches of law and/or the discussion of the liability of several parties to an action, or several defendants are being prosecuted. This is a decision for you once you have determined the issues that need to be discussed. \nYou may not have considered that you were constructing legal arguments. However, \nyou were. By the very act of applying legal rules to fact situations to provide a rationale for liability or non-liability of a relevant party you were creating legal argument. \n(3)Conclusion \nIt is always best practice to give an overall conclusion which can just be a few lines. This ensures that you can sum up the important parts of your argument (which you have proved at length in your main body) to answer the problem question. \nFigure 11 .1 sets out the four-stage method for approaching problem questions and \nthe threefold structure for writing your answer to a problem question. Each stage of the process and each aspect of the fnal written solution must be constantly subjected to your critical refection. \nA GUIDED DEMONSTRATION OF THE BASICS OF THE FOUR-\nSTAGE PROBLEM-SOLVING METHOD, USING PROBLEM \nQUESTION 2 IN TABLE 11 .1 AS AN EXAMPLE \nStage 1: identifcation of the legal issues arising \nfrom the facts in the problem question \nThe frst task is to read the question and determine the topic. In our example, the prob -\nlem area of law chosen is that of contract. The narrower topics here relate to whether a \ncontract had been concluded and, if so, whether an attempt to cancel the contract had been validly completed by one of the parties. The ability to do this is based on a solid understanding of the area and problem solution methods. \n\n--- Page 362 ---\n331   ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS\nSTARTFour stage method\nfor inves/g415ga/g415ng problem Structure of wri/g425en answer to problem ques/g415on: to \nbe undertaken a/g332er four stage method applied. \nSTART\nSTAGE 1: \nIden/g415ﬁca/g415on of  the \nlegal issues arising \nfrom the facts in the \nproblem ques/g415on\nSTAGE 2: \nIden/g415ﬁca/g415on of all \nrelevant legal rules\nSTAGE 3: \nApplica/g415on of \nrelevant legal rules to \nthe legal issues \niden/g415ﬁed\nSTAGE 4: \nYour determina/g415on of \nliability based on your \npredic/g415on of the \nlikely a pplica/g415on of \nthe  law1.

CONCLUSION\nDetermina/g415on of the poten/g415al liability of party/par/g415es \nand any available defences. Make adjustments if your \nthoughts have changed from the introduc/g415on to \nensure both conclusion and introduc/g415on ‘match’ (that \nyou have done what you said you would do). \nFigure 11.1  Four-stage method of problem solution mapped against the standard structure of a written \nsolution\n\n--- Page 363 ---\n    \n \n \n 332 ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS \nYou should have a clear idea of the areas of doubt where currently the law is unclear, \nas often this is the area in which problem questions will be located. \nThis frst stage of analysis involves a combination of linguistic ability and legal knowl -\nedge. Look carefully at Question 2 and identify the facts given and list them in a fow chart \nas this gives a timeline as well as making it easier to pick out issues and people (you will fnd an example of this at the end of the chapter). \nThe problem question can be underlined and issues drawn out in a very simple frst \nreading. This combination is demonstrated in Figure 11 .2. The words that are the clues \nto the legal issues are boxed and arrows leading from these words begin to discuss the legal issues raised. \nThere are two things to note in a problem question like this one that comes with two \nlabelled parts: (a) and (b): \nYou must answer both parts unless instructed clearly that candidates are to answer \neither  (a) or (b). Many students can fail here and assume there is a choice. Do not exercise \na choice unless this is clearly given; otherwise, you could lose half of the marks available for the problem question. \nIt is important to break the question down into its constituent issues so that the con -\ntext of (a) and (b) can be appreciated. \nStage 2: identifcation of all relevant legal rules \nIdentify the primary and secondary legal issues raised by the facts, available defences and doubts in the law. \nYou may choose to place the legal issues on a tree diagram. List the facts relevant to \neach issue. \nConsider the law that might apply, for example, legislation or common law. An offer must be communicated and be certain: Gibson v Manchester County Council \n(1978). Cedric’s email uses the words ‘interested’ in buying. It mentions no price. It is hard to see how this could be an offer. If this is the case, then Dorothy’s email cannot be con -\nstrued as an acceptance. However, Dorothy is clearly interested. We could argue that her response to Cedric’s email is an offer in response to his invitation to deal (technically ‘to treat’), an offer that contains both a price and a method of acceptance. This offer is clear and communicated. But has that offer been accepted? \nAn acceptance of an offer must be communicated and will not normally be implied \nfrom silence: Felthouse v Brindley  (1862). \nThe standard rule relating to an acceptance of an offer is that it must be communi -\ncated; however, case law does allow communication to be construed from conduct. \nCan it be said that because in (b) Cedric puts the marble aside labelled for Dorothy \nwith the price to pay he can be said to communicate acceptance in the circumstances by his conduct? To whom has he communicated his acceptance? How would Dorothy know? You will need to ask many similar questions and then check out law texts and primary legal rules to work towards an answer. \n\n--- Page 364 ---\n333   ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS\nFor every proposition you make you must refer to a law case in support. You cannot \nassert without legal authority to support you. However, as you become proficient it may \nbe the case that there is a persuasive precedent you could use for a small point, including \nfrom a minority or even dissenting judgment.Cedric , a dealer in marble , has a 2k g quan/g415ty of rare g reen Ionian marble for  \nsale.

In an area of doubt, for \nexample, on some occasions it may be enough to make a decision and back it by the \nstate of uncertainty and any case support no matter how tenuous. What the reader, who \nis also your marker, is looking for is your skill in dealing with such legal issues with con -\nfidence, competently demonstrating your knowledge of the area and the relevant cases, \nand competently applying that knowledge. Each subject area will have its own areas of \ndoubt and uncertainty, and these are the areas to concentrate upon: the rules, the excep -\ntions to the rules and the doubts. However, as a final demonstration, Figure 11 .3 begins \nto link propositions and cases.\nStage 3: application of relevant legal rules \nto the legal issues identified\nConsider each legal issue that you have raised, treating each potential liability and each \npotential party separately, and:\n  Decide the order in which issues will be raised in your answer.\n  Consider your view of uncertainties and gaps in the law in the area.\n  Consider issues of interpretation and defence.\n\n--- Page 366 ---\n     \n  \n  \n  ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS 335 \nA doubt about the interpretation of the law is not a defence; it is a doubt about the law. \nMake sure you do not make this mistake, as dealing with these doubts requires different approaches. \nIn our example, it should be apparent that you need to have a view as to whether a \ncontract has been concluded between Cedric and Dorothy, and if so when, before you can actually tackle questions (a) and (b). The answer to this is dependent upon whether an offer and an acceptance can be located. The issues to be considered can also be set out as a narrative where you should consider the effect of each component: \n(1) Cedric emails Dorothy stating he has marble to sell and is she interested? Is it an offer or an invitation to treat? \nNo price is mentioned. Is that normal business practice between them? \n(2) Dorothy’s email states yes, she would buy and gives a price. Is that an acceptance or an offer? \nIs Dorothy’s email an acceptance? Is Dorothy’s email a statement of intention? Is \nDorothy’s email an offer? \nCan Dorothy waive the necessity for the communication of the acceptance if she \nso chooses? \n(3) The problem question asks you to evaluate two responses to these facts, the frst (a) where Cedric ignored Dorothy’s email letter and sold to someone else for a higher price; and the second (b) where he put the marble aside in response to the email put -\nting a sticker on it saying sold and the price, but Dorothy did not collect it when she said she would and he missed out on selling it to someone else. \nYou are expected to consider the facts, legal issues and the uncertainties carefully, con -\nsulting case law and you would no doubt consult textbooks as well as case law concern -\ning these matters. \nWith regard to part (a), if a contract has been formed, then Cedric is in breach of this \ncontract when he sells the marble to Timothy. With regard to case law and commentators it does seem highly likely that, in these circumstances, no contract has been formed with Dorothy and Cedric is free to sell the marble. \nWith regard to part (b), if Dorothy has made an offer, not an acceptance, then Cedric \nhas possibly accepted the offer when he takes the step of setting aside the marble, as it is possible to show acceptance by conduct. If this is the case, a contract has been formed and Dorothy is obliged to buy the marble. It needs to be noted that there are faws and weaknesses in this particular question. There are, however, signifcant weaknesses in reaching this conclusion. \nIt should also be noticed that at present we have suggested issues but as yet we have no: \n  Argument by way of linked propositions. \n  Proofs (law cases) supporting or denying our propositions (or texts discussing areas where the law is unknown or uncertain). \n\n--- Page 367 ---\n    \n  \n  \n \n 336 ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS \nWithout a sustained argument backed by law cases there is no competent answer to the problem question. \nHaving used the word identifcation to sort out the legal issues they come down to the \nfollowing: \n(a) Is Cedric’s email an offer or an invitation to treat? \n(b) The answer to (a) determines the status of Dorothy’s email – it is either a counter offer or an acceptance. \nHow do we approach answering (a) and (b)? Much revolves around the issue of communication. \nStage 4: your determination of liability based on your \nprediction of the likely application of the law \nThe facts in a problem question can give rise to many issues but all of these may not be \nnecessary to resolve the specifc question(s) set in your problem. Problem questions tend to ask you to do one of two main things: \n  discuss the issues raised in the problem scenario; \n  advise one or all of the parties. \nBoth types of problem question require the same knowledge to answer them success -\nfully. However, your approach to the answers will differ. In response to a question about \ndiscussing issues in general you must raise all the issues without privileging one party. Where you have been asked to advise one or all of the parties, you must raise all the issues but orientate your argument to the effect of those issues on the party, or parties, you are specifcally asked to advise, discussing, with reasons, the likely allocation of legal liability and the possibility of any available defences. \nOnce you have come to a decision and know that you have carefully followed each of \nthe four stages you have all of the information required to produce a well-written response to the problem question. This needs to be structured according to the standardised for -\nmat of introduction, main body, and conclusion. \nCONCLUSION \nA problem solution does not require the discussing of academic articles and books \n(unless the book or article has been ‘judicially recognised’ in court). However, you will no doubt need to consult secondary academic texts to develop your understanding of the legal issues involved in your problem question. When you write your answer, however, all you are required to do is to engage in a discussion of relevant legal authority (cases) and statutory rules. \n\n--- Page 368 ---\n     \n \n ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS 337 \nWhatever type of problem question you are dealing with, the same type of information \nbase is required. It is how this information, knowledge and understanding are drawn on \nto produce a particular written result that is important. \nFollowing standard methods for the preparation and construction of problem question \nanswers can help you effectively order the different tasks involved. You can move on to your own preferred methods. \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  A problem question at the academic stage of education is a fctitious legal dispute invariably drafted in such a way as to raise situations where there are conditions of doubt about facts, legal issues or the interpretation of the law. \n  A problem solution tests whether you understand a particular area of law well and can apply it. \n  Problem questions are often set in areas of doubt, so always be wary if you think the answer to the problem is simple and clear cut. \n  You have to have a good understanding of the way in which series of cases have developed areas of law, how different judgments by leading senior judges can be of relevance in the development of legal argument, and you need to appreciate the relationship between legislation and case law, and the role of statutory interpretation by the judiciary. \n  The student is expected to only refer to legal (unless the judges in specifc cases have referred to academic articles or books in court, which is unlikely – but possible in certain defned situations). \n  Problem questions bring together all of the skills of research, argumentation, critical analysis and application of law. \n  Problem questions are specifcally designed to test your developing abilities to research, handle and apply legal rules, construct an argument and engage in competent writing. \n  The key to answering a problem question successfully lies in spotting the ‘clues’ to the issues to be discussed. Many of these are purely linguistic and organisational, using prepositions, signposting words, and use of dates and times that may need to be unravelled. \n  There are several methods recognised for outlining the issues that need to be dealt with in problem questions (IRAC, IPAC, CLEO, PLAN). \n  All methods tend to involve the same four general stages. Stage 1: identifcation of the legal issues arising from the facts in the problem \nquestion. \nStage 2: identifcation of all relevant legal rules. Stage 3: application of relevant legal rules to the legal issues identifed (including \nthose relating to any defence or mitigation and discussion of any interpretational doubts concerning relevant legal rules). \n\n--- Page 369 ---\n    338 ANSWERING LEGAL PROBLEM QUESTIONS \nStage 4: your determination of liability based on your prediction of the likely applica -\ntion of the law. \n  In many respects the threefold structure used for essays (introduction, main body \nand conclusion) can equally be used to structure a problem question solution:  Introduction to problem solution. \n The main body of answer which relates to all of the issues raised in the introduction. \n Conclusion. \n  Following standard methods for the preparation and construction of problem ques -\ntion answers can help you effectively order the different tasks involved. \n\n--- Page 370 ---\n12 \n  \n ORAL PRESENTATIONS \nAND MOOTING \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Understand the specifc personal skills of oral delivery, such as volume and tone of \nvoice, body position, eye contact and speed of delivery, and how they equate with written skills. \n  Appreciate the importance of understanding the skills sets required for differing types of oral skills exercise. \n  Understand the issues involved in managing an oral skills exercise. \n  Develop personal confdence in public speaking in front of your peer group and teachers. \n  Appreciate the need to have competent visual aids if required by the assessor. \n  Engage with the factual and legal analysis of a moot problem. \n  Understand the general rules of engagement governing mooting (for example, issues of timing, submissions and exchange of documentation). \n  Write a speech for oral delivery. \n  Start delivering mooting speeches. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-15  \n\n--- Page 371 ---\n    \n 340 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \nINTRODUCTION \nAny form of rounded academic education should ensure that graduates leave university \nwith excellent communication skills. Legal education at the academic stage provides you with several different opportunities to develop your oral skills. In addition, should you intend to pursue a career in law, the vocational stage of legal training majors on assess -\ning students as they engage in a large number of oral exercises that test competency in a range of differing types of oral communication skills, as well as the ability to apply legal rules or deliver legal information. \nIn any case, however, it is enormously important to be able to make your arguments \nconvincingly – whether you become a lawyer or not. It is highly likely that you will need to present your work or your opinion orally sooner rather than later. This could be in an assessed presentation in your modules, as part of the professional training of becoming a lawyer, as part of a moot exercise, as a way of presenting your report to your line man -\nager, as a way to convince your clients or customers or in many other forms. \nMooting is an excellent way to work on these skills, and it is strongly recommended \nthat you take part in mooting activities at your law school as early as possible – even if you already decided that you do not want to become a barrister. Part of this chapter will explain some of the peculiarities of a mooting presentation. \nMANAGING STRESS \nEveryone fnds speaking in public challenging, and everyone gets stressed and nervous about it – including your lecturers, and including seasoned barristers with years of court experience. The only way to reduce the stress and anxiety is, unfortunately, to confront it. This is one of the reasons why doing presentations during your studies is a great exercise. Keep in mind that your audience – especially at university – wants you to succeed and do well. Your lecturers and your fellow students understand your challenges and are there to support you. If you get stuck, make a mistake, forget something you wanted to say or start sweating or trembling, it is not the end of the world – everyone will understand! Make sure to expose yourself to as many presentation exercises as possible, in modules, socie -\nties (mooting, debating, acting) or outside of university (e.g. in a local Toastmasters club). \nWith time, things will get easier. You can fnd ways to reduce the stress, and you can \nfnd ways of ensuring that people do not notice that you are nervous. Remind yourself constantly to slow down – most people speed up under stress. And one of the most important things is to control your breathing. Remind yourself to breathe calmly through -\nout the presentation, and plan for having breaks in your delivery. There are plenty of exercises that can help you establish calm, natural breathing. Also make sure you have a glass of water with you during the presentation. Stress makes the mouth dry out, which makes speaking more diffcult. \n\n--- Page 372 ---\n     \n \n \n  341 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \nAnd probably the best way of controlling your nervousness is to be in charge of the mate -\nrial. If you prepare well, know the topic and your arguments, you will be more relaxed than if \nyou have just started reading the night before and are not quite sure what some of the things you say mean. If you rehearse the presentation multiple times, you will also feel more relaxed. \nTHE COMPONENTS OF COMPLETING A PRESENTATION \nThe main types of oral skills exercises that you are liable to encounter on your law degree course are set out in Figure 12 .1. \nSome of these will be individual tasks only; others will require group work. Whatever \nthe nature of the oral skills tasks, their successful completion involves working on six key components (usually several at the same time): \n  understanding the nature of the task; \n  managing the task; \nTYPES OF \nORAL \nEXERCISE Debating \nNegotiation \nMooting \nPresentations Client \ncounselling \nand \ninterviewing Mediation \nFigure 12.1 Types of oral skills exercises \n\n--- Page 373 ---\n    \n \n  342 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \n  research; \n  content; \n  delivery; \n  teamwork. \nEach of these six components is interconnected, as demonstrated in Figure 12 .3, and a \ndefciency in one area can affect results for assessed exercises. \nKey components of oral skills exercises \n(1) Understanding \n• The nature of the task. \n• The type of task. • The requirements of the task. \n(2) Managing • Micro management of your personal time. \n• Macro management of a team and the team’s  time. \n• Managing your stress. \n(3) Research • Understanding the legal question posed by the task. \n• Dividing the task into sub-tasks as appropriate for research. • Researching the main issue and sub-issues. \n(4) Content of oral skills exercise • Ensuring content relevant to the question. \n• Ensuring competent argument(s) put forward . \n• Incorporating a rich range of sources to support argument(s) constructed. • Using appropriate referencing – even oral skills work will require some referencing protocols. \n(5) Delivery • Use appropriate voice tone, speed of voice, and vocabulary. \n• Support oral skills work with appropriate, high quality audio-visual aids for the audience (the \nmarker). \n• Deploy useful prompt cards. • Produce an accurate copy of the full text of oral delivery for the marker. \n(6) Team work • Utilising different types of management and planning in the previous points. \n• Working to ensure there is a good interpersonal re lationship for the task. \n• Managing team member performance. • Managing the expectations of group members. \nFigure 12.2 Summarises the nature of these six components \n\n--- Page 374 ---\n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING 343 \n3  RESEARCH \n2 MA NAGING THE Sound research and \nTASK selection of sources \nis essential. \n4 CONTEN T \nThe construction of 1 UNDERSTANDING sound arguments to \nTHE NATURE OF the questions \nTHE TA SK supported by the \nresearched sources. \n5 DELIVERY \nConfident use of oral \n6 TE AMWORK skills, audio-visual \naids, speaker This impacts on all prompts.

The \nmain differences occur at the level of delivery in terms of style and language, and whether teamwork is involved. \nThe following sections work through each of the components in detail. \nUnderstanding \nThere are several types of oral skills tasks and each has different requirements. You and your team (if there is one) must commit proper time to make sure you know exactly what the task is, what it is testing and drawing out all its issues. If you do not properly under -\nstand the task itself, you will not obtain a good result. \n\n--- Page 375 ---\n    344 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \nMake sure you do not only understand the questions but also the surrounding factors: \n  What is the time limit? \n  Are you allowed to or do you have to use slides? \n  Is this presentation supposed to cover the whole topic or is it supposed to be a \npart of a discussion? \nManaging the task \nThere are two levels at which it is important to manage the task: the macro organisation of the order and timing of each sub-task that leads to the fnal product, and the micro organisation of ensuring the time limit for actual delivery is met. \nOverall task management \nThe degree of detail required by the oral skills exercise will be determined by the time -\nscale you have been given. A fve-minute presentation cannot deliver the same level of detail as a 25-minute one. The longer you have, the more detailed your presentation would have to be. \nAlso, an assessed oral exercise will be treated somewhat differently to a non-assessed \nexercise as it will be supplied with assessment criteria. These give details of what the marker is looking for in the fnished exercise, and the skills levels required to obtain marks in each grade. You should be given a copy of the mark sheet and assessment criteria that the assessor will use, or be directed to a general mark sheet and general oral skills assessment criteria that are used for oral assessment. \nThe assessment criteria and the mark sheet are important documents to consider \nbecause they tell you what you have to do and how this should be demonstrated. You should also check the marks allocations as you will fnd out how many marks are avail -\nable for content and argument construction, how many for teamwork if relevant and how many for the purely oral skills of tone of voice, speed of voice, use of appropriate formal language and so on. \nIf you need to prepare a group presentation, this is the time to set out the different \ntasks within the dissertation. \nTime limits \nThe ‘time limit’ given for any oral skills work can be viewed as having the same function as a ‘word limit’ in written work. But whilst departmental regulations can often allow leeway on word counts, time limits in oral assessments are rigorously applied, and the student will be asked to stop speaking when the time is up. If crucial matters have not been dealt with, this can have a detrimental effect on the overall mark awarded for the assessment. \n\n--- Page 376 ---\n     \n ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING 345 \nMake sure to practice your presentation several times and to see how you are doing \nfor time: all of your brilliant points you researched are lost if the lecturer cuts you off half -\nway through a presentation. If you are over the time, do not try to make up for it by speak -\ning more quickly or by cutting pauses, as it is essential that you are understandable. \nResearch (understanding the question) \nYou must ensure that you have properly and thoroughly understood the question. \nResearching the right area requires that you ascertain what the question is asking for. The issues here are no different to the type of investigations you were directed to engage in for law reports and secondary sources. Ask yourself what issues you think fow out of the question posed. \nWhatever the exact nature of your oral skills exercise you will be called upon to deploy \nargument. You can only hold a plausible given position (for or against a proposal) if you know what the question is asking. \nPreparing the presentation \nOnce you are sure you know what the question requires of you, start reading and laying out your arguments in the same way as described in previous chapters. The depth you need to get into depends on the question and on the time limit given. A two-minute pres -\nentation on the legal challenges of euthanasia requires a very different presentation than a 15-minute presentation on the defence of insanity. A presentation on Parliamentary Sovereignty and the Human Rights Act will require a different structure than a presenta -\ntion in which you are supposed to represent a fctional client in a tort case. \nBut even in a short presentation, you need to get a good overview of the topic, and \nyou need to make sure you understand the different opinions held. If you are making an argument for one side (e.g. in a moot), make sure you research the arguments for the other side as well as your own – you will need to answer to these, and it is important that you are prepared for that. Use your research and drafting skills that you have gathered in the previous chapters and make sure no counter argument or question can surprise you. \nNotes \nYou should compile good notes, making sure that they are effciently referenced so the original sources can be quickly located if needed. Of course, if it is an assessed presenta -\ntion, your marker will also expect to hear your sources during the presentation. \nIf you are working in a group, make sure you share your notes with each other. This \nway each group member will have a good understanding of the entire presentation, not only of their part, and this can also help avoid any duplication of efforts. A good idea for sharing notes is to use collaborative editing tools such as Offce365 or Google Docs. \n\n--- Page 377 ---\n    \n 346 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \nContent \nWith very few exceptions, a university-level presentation will require you to create a con -\nsidered argument. There are several things that you can do to ensure the content of your \npresentation is academically acceptable and the argument is well constructed. \nEnsure that your presentation is relevant to the question \nRead your notes and refect on the question in light of the information that you have col -\nlected. Understanding can sometimes occur instantly, like a light being switched on. It is, however, more likely for understanding to dawn more slowly, as you think about issues, read your notes, ask yourself questions and refect on the points that you do or do not understand. If you are team working, these tasks of refection should occur individually and then as part of group discussions. \nEnsure that you build competent arguments \nBegin the process of building arguments based on your notes and your growing under -\nstanding. This text uses the following defnition of argument: \nAn argument is a series of statements, some backed by evidence, some not, that are purposely presented in order to prove, or disprove, a given position. \nThe use of good time management is essential. There is no point in having an excel -\nlent argument if you do not appropriately manage the time limit of the presentation and therefore cannot deliver your argument. Diffcult decisions will need to be taken concern -\ning what can be said and what cannot be said within the time allowed. You will also be expected to refer to your evidence (academic texts, law, judges); how you decide to do this in view of existing time limits is important. \nOften you will be asked to submit a written version of your presentation unless it is \nrecorded on flm. This must contain all sources properly referenced. You need to know the differences between full referencing in a written format and referencing orally in a presentation. \nStructure \nA coherent and well thought through structure is even more important for a presentation than for an essay. The reader of an essay can fick back through the pages if she is not sure why exactly you are writing something; the listener to your presentation, however, will just be lost. \nThe structure for a good presentation has been the same ever since the ancient Greeks \nstarted thinking about Rhetoric – the art of persuasion: \n\n--- Page 378 ---\n     \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n           ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING 347 \n1. Beginning \nBegin with the captatio benevolentiae , the greeting to ensure a friendly audience. \nOne of the most famous captatios is the beginning of the speech by Marc Anthony in \nShakespeare’s ‘Julius Caesar’: ‘Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears’. This way, he made sure that the audience could see they are on the same side as him by pointing out their commonalities and by politely asking for their time. \nYour presentation does not have to reach the lofty heights of William Shakespeare’s \nMarc Anthony, but it is a good idea to welcome the audience in a friendly and respect -\nful way. This is also a good time for using a bit of humour to break the ice, but do not forget that you are in a formal setting. \n2. Introduction \nSimilar to an essay, you need to tell the audience what you are going to argue, and \nyou need to prepare them at least a little bit for the coming part. Say clearly what your argument is, and explain briefy how you are going to justify this. \n3. The facts \nIn a very short part, you explain the facts that your presentation is based upon. \nThese should be neutral, non-contested facts, but of course you can use this to intro -\nduce some spin by picking facts that will convince the audience. \nIf you want to argue that there should be stricter laws on knife crime, tell the audi -\nence how many victims of knife crime there were in the last year. If your presentation is in a slightly more political setting (e.g. a debate entry), tell the audience a very short story of a young boy who was killed by a knife attack to ensure sympathy and to frame the debate. \nThis part needs to be very brief and clear. \n4. Division \nHere, you show in a neutral way where the issue lies and what the different argu -\nments on the topic are. This is essentially where you set the focus for what is about to come. \n5. Proof \nThis part should be the main emphasis of your argument. What are the different \nsub-arguments that support the point you made in the introduction. \nIdeally, you begin with a strong argument, then use the weaker ones, and fnish \nthis part with the strongest point you have to make. \n6. Refutation \nHere, you show what arguments there are on the other side. In a debate setting, \nyou could address the presentation your opponent already made, or you could pre -\nempt their arguments (‘My opponent will argue that …’); in a stand-alone presenta -\ntion you can use this to counter writers or judges that have argued differently, or to pre-empt questions the listener might have in their head (‘The most common argu -\nments put forward against my proposition are …’). \nYou need to be calm and rational at this point. Show clearly and logically why a \n(real or fctional) opponent will not be able to weaken your argument. \n\n--- Page 379 ---\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n 348 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \n7. Conclusion \nSummarise your main argument and the supportive points very briefy. If you were \na politician holding a speech, you would need to fnd a memorable and tweetable \nsentence that your audience remembers (e.g. ‘Ich bin ein Berliner’) – whether this is appropriate in your setting depends on the task given. \nDelivery \nSpeech \nYour oral skills exercise is a performance and your voice can be considered as an instru -\nment. It matters therefore how loud or soft it is, how quickly or slowly you speak. Your voice is your expression of yourself to the outside world. You use it to express pain, joy, fear, nervousness, excitement and more. You can slow it down, speed it up, make it loud, make it almost inaudible or utter many different levels of sound in between. Your voice comes with its own particular resonance and accent, giving you a unique vocal stamp. \nIt is not easy to fnd the right tone, volume and pace for a presentation, but the more \nyou practice, the better you will get. It also depends strongly on the setting: you will need to speak differently when you are in a seminar room with ten other students and a lecturer than when you are in a lecture theatre with 300 seats. For the latter you will need to pro -\nject your voice: not shouting, but talking to the last row in the theatre. Breathing deeply and calmly is the key, and it is even more important to take breaks so you can focus on your breathing. There are plenty of exercises you can do to practice projection and breathing – the online video platform of your choice will have a lot of material for public speakers and aspiring actors. \nPace is also very important to a good presentation. Most people have the tendency \nto speak too fast, either because they have to cover a lot of material or because they are nervous. Remind yourself regularly to slow down throughout the presentation, especially when you notice your audience is losing track. \nTry recording yourself when you are talking and listen to your recording, even if that \ncan be a painful experience at frst. Pay attention to unnecessary fller words (‘like’, ‘I mean’, ‘well’, ‘actually’) and to sounds like ‘err’ or ‘uhmm’. These can be quite irritat -\ning for listeners after a while, even if they are probably guilty of the same when they are speaking. Often, the cure against this is to speak more slowly and to make pauses in your speech. These are necessary, not only for you to catch a breath and to gather your thoughts, but also for the listener to refect on what you are saying. \nUsing your notes \nPoliticians will often read their entire speech from a teleprompter, and they sometimes do a very good job at that. However, you should never read a presentation from your notes. Not only do you not have the teleprompter that allows you to look at your audience whilst \n\n--- Page 380 ---\n     \n \n \n \n ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING 349 \ntalking, but you also do not have the speech writers that work exactly for that scenario, \nand, with all due respect, you probably are not as experienced a speaker as these politi -\ncians are. \nUnless you are Barack Obama (in which case: thank you for buying our book, Mr \nPresident), you will almost certainly not have the skills to make a read out presentation interesting and engaging. Reading out a presentation almost always makes it sound arti -\nfcial and dull, and your attention will be focused entirely on the piece of paper in front of you, not with your audience. You will be scared to lose the line you are reading, and you will only be able to look at your audience very briefy before hastily looking back to where you were on the page. \nWhat is far more likely to lead to a successful and relaxed presentation is speaking \nfreely. Only have some key words on index cards to ensure that you are reminded of all necessary points, and try not to be too fxated on those either. This, again, is where prepa -\nration and rehearsal really helps. Once you are in control of the material, not much can go wrong, and even if you make a mistake and have to correct yourself, it is not the end of the world. Your audience is on your side and knows that this is a stressful experience for you. \nWhen you speak freely, your presentation can become much more engaging. You see \nhow your audience reacts, and you can react accordingly. Slow down or even repeat points if people look confused, make things a bit shorter when you realise that a point was quite obvious after all. \nEye contact \nThis is one of the easiest and most important ways to engage your audience. Establish eye contact with your listeners (your classmates as well, do not just focus on your lec -\nturer). This gives them the feeling you are talking directly to them (people talking admira -\nbly of great orators will often say ‘it felt like she was talking just with me’) and establishes a connection and sympathy. It will also help you – focus on people you know to be nice in the audience and you will feel a bit less nervous. \nBody language and gestures \nSlouching, leaning against furniture and putting your hands in your pockets can all be distracting. Do not let yourself down by using inappropriate body language for the cir -\ncumstances. You will usually be asked to stand for your presentation, and it is a good idea to do so in any case. This will help you focus and it will assist your breathing. \nYou can make use of gestures to support your arguments, but make sure not to overdo \nit. Your gestures should never be the focus of attention for your listener. \nIf you have the chance to walk around during your presentation, you can use this to \nensure you still have the attention of your audience. You can change your place in the room 2–3 times during your presentation, but you should not appear like a caged tiger pacing up and down the enclosure. \n\n--- Page 381 ---\n    350 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \nPractice in front of a mirror or recording your presentation as a video can help you \nobserve yourself and to ensure that all of these points are observed. Also pay attention \nto habits you might have when you are stressed – playing with your hair, clicking the pen you might be holding, tapping your fngers on the desk or arranging your index cards on a constant basis can all be quite distracting for your audience whilst you are not even aware you are doing it. \nVisual aid \nIt has become an almost universal standard to use PowerPoint (or similar software) for a presentation. For a lot of people (including the author), this is a sad development, but it is also a development that is almost inevitable. Most audiences expect to see visual slides for a longer presentation. Before you start preparing slides, however, make sure to check the task you are given for the presentation. Especially on law courses, lecturers sometimes will ask you to prepare a presentation without slides – after all, you cannot rely on this in a courtroom either. \nIf you are using slides, you need to ensure you are using them properly. The phrase \n‘death by PowerPoint’ is often used and shows a major problem that a lot of people have when they prepare presentations: they try to include each and every detail on the slides, and they feel that it is necessary to include long direct quotations. In a presentation like this, the audience is usually distracted and cannot follow the speaker because they are trying to read the material on the slides – not the effect you want to have! \nSlides should be short and concise, and you should not have many. They should help \nthe listener, but they should not be the focus of attention. You can use them to show visual material (e.g. a map when explaining an international law dispute) or to provide the structure of your points. Your slides do not need to (and should not) show the entire content of the presentation. \nHow you design the slides is a matter of taste, but again, keep in mind that the slides \nshould not distract from the content. Flashy artwork, bright colours and exciting transi -\ntions might have their place, but that place is not in the background of your presentation. \nClothing \nSometimes, your lecturer issues a dress code for the presentation, and it is important to follow that. Otherwise, it is always a good idea to dress a bit more formally then you usu -\nally do. Your clothes have an infuence on you and will help you get into the right mindset for your presentation. Make sure you are still comfortable, though. \nTeamwork \nOral skills exercises, whether assessed or non-assessed, will often involve team or group work. This brings into play another range of interpersonal skills and can be quite stressful, \n\n--- Page 382 ---\n     \n \n \n ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING 351 \nparticularly if the exercise is assessed. Sometimes you will be allowed to choose your \ngroup, and sometimes (perhaps most often) your group will be neutrally allocated to you by your lecturer. Many of you will have experienced some degree of team working prior to university, and it may have been a good or a bad experience. \nThis can seem very unfair. You might feel you are the only person doing the work, \nand you might fnd some of your teammates irritating to work with, be it because of their personality, their habits or their views on the topic. Unfortunately, chances are high that you will make this experience many, many times in your life, not just in university, but also later in the workplace. The fact is that success in life is very much down to your ability to engage at the appropriate time in competent interpersonal skills and to work as part of a team. The development of interpersonal skills through team working is one of the essen -\ntial skills of a competent graduate. \nMany students working in teams or groups do not stop to consider the challenges of \nworking with other people. It is important to note that everyone in the group may have different understandings of how to: \n  work with others as part of a team; \n  manage their own time; \n  make sense of the material collected; \n  make useful notes; \n  make sense of the question; \n  deliver an oral presentation. \nNothing can be more destructive to teamwork than self-appointed leaders ineffciently \nbullying others to do the work. The importance of commencing each team task as a group and considering what the task requires, how it will be managed and timed and who will do what, by when, cannot be overemphasised. \nYou will need to take everyone as they are, and try to support them as much as pos -\nsible so that your team delivers a satisfactory outcome. But there is a limit to what you should tolerate. If any of your team members are impossible to work with, either because they are completely unreliable or because they resort to bullying and aggression, speak to your lecturer, who will have strategies to deal with a situation like this. \nMOOTING \nMooting is a specifc form of presentation and is very popular and very important in law school, mostly outside the curriculum, but sometimes as part of a module. Whilst all the previous points (with the exception of the use of PowerPoint) are applicable in a moot as well, there are some peculiarities connected to mooting that shall be dis -\ncussed below. \n\n--- Page 383 ---\n    \n \n \n 352 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \nWhat is mooting? \nA moot is a competitive simulation of an appellate court hearing designed to test students’ \nability to orally present a well-structured legal argument in relation to narrow grounds of appeal based on a question of law. The setting can either be the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. \nIn addition to the grounds of appeal, mooters are given the facts of the original fcti -\ntious dispute and a fctitious procedural history. The appeal points argued could go either way and so everything depends upon the skill of the mooter. \nIt is conducted according to highly structured rules of engagement. A legal academic \nor professional lawyer role-plays the judge. Two teams of students role-play senior and junior counsel for the appellants and respondents. The presiding judge can stop counsel at any time in their submission and ask questions. \nImportance of mooting \nIt cannot be overemphasised how good an opportunity mooting is. Even if you already decided that you do not want to become a barrister, it is a good idea to join the mooting society in your law school, and to take part in their activities and training. Having com -\npeted on a national or international level will not only look good in your CV, but it will also give you a unique opportunity for development that will be useful in future assessments and ultimately your career. \nStudents often think that they need experience to compete in moots and are therefore \nreluctant to join in their frst year. Do not make that mistake: often, year 1 students are already on a high level, and you can gather a lot of valuable experience in the mooting chambers that will help you improve in year 2 and 3. \nIt will almost certainly be stressful to make the frst step and to make your frst argument \nin front of a judge. But as outlined above: everyone else shares that feeling, and your audi -\nence is generally sympathetic to you. Chances are that even a professional judge presiding over the moot will remember how diffcult her frst step into the career was all those years ago. This is the perfect place to practice and the perfect place to overcome the worst fears. \nAs well as developing valuable communication skills, particularly oral skills, mooting \nalso develops your ability to discriminate between legal arguments, determining which you consider to support your argument and which do not. It also refnes your skills of fact management, legal research and argument construction. Mooting requires that you analyse legal rules and apply them effciently and correctly to the grounds of appeal. As moots always involve working with others, mooting also develops the important graduate skill of team working. \nThe participants in a moot \nThere are many roles in a moot, and like other activities mooting requires quite a lot of behind the scenes administration to make it work smoothly. Student law societies can \n\n--- Page 384 ---\n     \n \n \n \n ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING 353 \nhave a sub-committee dealing with mooting, or there can be a freestanding mooting society. \nThe moot master/mistress \nThe moot master or mistress ensures judges are available to judge, usually setting up rotas of judges in competition times. It is their job to make sure that the documentation the parties should give each other is indeed exchanged and copies given to the judge. Additionally they should ensure that any other documentation, required under the rules of engagement governing the moot, is duly produced and exchanged as necessary. \nThey also make sure that the room is properly laid out for mooting with the judge able \nto clearly see all counsel. The standard arrangement is for appellants and respondents to have their desks at an angle to the judge’s desk. The appellants are to the left of the judge and the respondents to the right. \nThe judge \nThis is a key role as the judge not only decides which party ‘wins’ the legal point on appeal; they decide overall which team wins the moot. It is not necessarily the case that the team winning the legal point will win the moot. The judge will consider a range of issues from competent oral skills delivery (such as pace, tone, clarity, appropriate vocabulary and terms of address to the court and other counsel) to the construction of legal argument, depth of understanding of the material and response to questioning. \nThe clerk \nNot all moots have a clerk, whose role is to assist the judge. This role is again taken by a student and their duties will involve passing authorities to the judge with page references already located and timekeeping which can be particularly important in moots where judicial questioning periods are not part of the overall time count. \nCounsel \nMooting teams consist of two students who are role playing either senior or junior coun -\nsel. It is customary for the more experienced mooter to be senior counsel and the less experienced mooter to be the junior. One of the main reasons for this is that senior coun -\nsel speaks frst and for the less experienced mooter to speak frst can be stressful. Also it is senior counsel for the appellant who deals with the right to reply. Dividing the different legal arguments between the counsels is a key part of the moot. \nThe appellants determine the agenda for the moot, as they have brought the appeal \nhaving lost the previous case. They go frst, setting out the reasons why the previous decision in the lower court was wrong. \n\n--- Page 385 ---\n    \n \n 354 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \nAs it is known that the respondents will counter argue, it is good practice to incor -\nporate into the submissions made potential rebuttals of positions that it is predicted the \nrespondents will take (‘My learned friend will argue that … That is wrong, because …’). So when the respondents come to bring their case they need to deal with these rebuttals if indeed they have taken the positions assumed by the appellant. \nSenior counsel for the appellants begins the moot by delivering the frst speech. \nBecause of this it is their responsibility to introduce their party and the respondents to the judge and set out the frst point on appeal. Where a right of reply is allowed this will be done by senior council. \nThe winning side from the previous case responds to the points raised by the appellants \nand responds to each point. Failure to respond to any point means in effect they concede or are accepting the validity of that particular point. It is essential for the respondents to dispose of the appellant’s points before proceeding to their own legal submissions. This can be particularly diffcult if the appellants have correctly predicted their argument and rebutted it in their submission. \nSenior counsel speaks frst, opening the respondent’s argument, and deals with the frst \npoint on appeal, ensuring that all points raised by senior counsel for the appellants are rebut -\nted. Again, junior counsel deals with the second point on appeal, rebutting points made by junior counsel for the appellants. The junior closes the argument on behalf of the respondents. \nThe rules \nTime limits \nMooting is a time-limited exercise. If counsel runs out of time before the end of the sub -\nmissions to be made to the court it is going to affect the fnal outcome of the moot. In a competition this could mean losing the moot. It is normal for 15 minutes to be allocated to each side, but you will be informed of the time limit. The judge will ask counsel questions during their speech and usually time stops for the duration of the question and answer. However, in some moots a decision is made that time will not stop. This means that it is essential for the mooter to succinctly respond to questioning and move back as swiftly as possible to their actual speech. \nTurn-taking in a moot, the ‘order of submissions’ \nThere are two main models used for the ordering of counsel submissions in a moot. It is important that you ensure you know which model is being used for your moot as it could affect the manner in which you wish to present your submissions with your teammate. These are set out in Figures  12.4 and 12.5 below. \nThe ‘right to reply’ \nFrom the two fgures above you will have seen that the last stage in both models is the ‘right to reply’ to the respondent’s case. Only the appellants have a ‘right to reply’. This is \n\n--- Page 386 ---\n     \n  \n \n    \n  ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING 355 \nThe appellants’ case is \ngiven in its en\u0010rety by \nsenior and junior counsel. The respondents’ case is \nput in its en\u0010rety by \nsenior and junior counsel.

They can therefore incorporate a response (if they deem it necessary) into their submissions to the court. The appellants have a right of reply because as they presented frst they did not have the option to incorporate a response into their speech. \nSome moots, particularly at the level of competitions, operate without the ‘right of \nreply’. The reason put for this is that only senior counsel for the appellant has the right, and this can put an undue burden on senior counsel. \nThe skeleton argument \nThis is, as the word skeleton suggests, a basic outline of the legal submissions that are to be put by counsel. It will also contain a list of authorities to be relied upon. Usually, a copy is given to the judge and to the other party 24 hours in advance so that they have a preview of the way in which the argument is to be advanced. \nMake sure to familiarise yourself with the other side’s skeleton argument, and to work \nthis into your own arguments. It is often said that you should know the other side’s argu -\nment as well as your own! \nBundles \nA bundle refers to a specifc set of documents that mooters will be relying on in the legal submissions that they will be making. It will include a copy of the moot problem, the skel -\neton argument and copies of every case that you are relying upon. This is not required in every moot, and you should only prepare one if it helps your arguments. \nThe cases must be put together in the same order as they appear in the skeleton argu -\nment. It is not acceptable to just copy the part that you will rely on; the entire case must \n\n--- Page 387 ---\n    356 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \nbe copied. Make sure that you use either the print version of the case or a pdf version, so \nthat the original page numbering is preserved. \nWhen your bundle is completed in the correct order make sure you number each page \nto aid the judge in fnding their way around your bundle. You may wish to consider using fle dividers to separate the moot problem, skeleton argument and cases. Ensure you clearly guide the judge to the correct place in the bundle and then to the correct place in the case, for example: \nMay I refer your Ladyship to the words of Lord Atkin in the case of McAlister (or Donoghue) and Stevenson reported in the Appeal Cases for 1932 at page 562, which can be located in the cases section of the bundle, at bundle page 25. \nAnalysis of the moot problem \nThe procedural history is of importance as it will tell you what the decisions were of the initial trial court, and if applicable the Court of Appeal if you are mooting in the Supreme Court. It is essential to know how issues were treated at earlier stages. Also the focus of the appeal is highly likely to be much narrower than the issues in the original trial. It is not enough to know that a particular party won/lost in an earlier hearing; it is essential to know on what point or points they won/lost and why the court determined that they should win/lose, as well as to understand in detail the exact grounds for appeal. And, it might be obvious, but be very sure that you know which side you are representing. As you are in an appeals case, this can be confusing, and it is not unknown for a mooting team to turn up ready to represent the wrong party! \nDo not just consider the procedural history from your client’s perspective, but addition -\nally put yourself into the shoes of the other party and consider it from their perspective. \nIf you are acting for the party that won at trial, you can argue that the trial judge was \nsurely best placed to decide as they did, being in command of the facts and being able to view witnesses, witness statements and other evidence. It is good practice to start your moot by referring to the trial judge in these circumstances. The reasoning of a judge at frst instance, or even at a prior appeal, is of importance to both parties as it sheds light on the rationale behind the decision. However, this is not to say that you should only deal with the judge’s reasoning; you must move to the wider reasoning appropriate for the appeal as soon as you have dealt with the trial judge. \nIt is of the utmost importance that you know and understand the facts of the moot \nproblem. These are presented in detail in the moot problem and they are key for your understanding of the appeal points and the construction of your fnal legal argument forming the basis of your submissions to the court. \nIt is not unknown for mooters to make up facts to fll gaps or extend their argument. \nThis is not acceptable. The facts in the moot problem are hypothetical, but they are also the facts agreed or found in the trial and cannot be added to, changed, or be made the object of interpretation for any reason. \n\n--- Page 388 ---\n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING 357 \nHowever, it is essential that you weave the facts as given to you by the moot problem into \nyour argument on the point of law. Part of the skill of a mooter is the way in which they seek to apply generalised or abstract legal rules to a particular set of facts. Your legal argument therefore must be grounded in the facts and you should refer to them in your submissions. There can be a tendency amongst mooters to engage in a purely objectifed discussion of the law relevant to the grounds of appeal without connecting it to the facts of the moot problem. It is this skill that allows you to argue persuasively, which is important because as already noted a moot is constructed out of issues that could be decided either way. If your argument is too abstract, you are missing out on the ability to tie them to the facts and invite the judge to decide in your favour because of the relevance of your legal argument to the facts and the point on appeal. To argue in an abstract manner divorced from the facts of the moot problem is a common error. Make sure that it is not an error you make. \nMany professional lawyers, as well as academics and students, will begin their analy -\nsis by drawing up a chronology of events (a timeline) in relation to the facts. You might be tempted to think that your moot does not require this as events occurred over a day or two. But you would be wrong: a timeline even of events taking place in a limited timescale can assist you to clarify matters. When you stand back and look at your timeline, issues that you have not so far thought of may spring to mind. As you read it over again as you retrieve relevant sources then you may well fnd issues that you had overlooked. \nRead every sentence and phrase in a sentence attentively, looking for issues that \nyou may have overlooked. A moot has been specifcally written to test you; therefore, one implication is that no sentence is without merit or relevance. No aspect of the moot problem, and especially the facts, should be left without thorough analysis. This analysis should be repeated once you have engaged in your research as that will undoubtedly have improved your understanding and will allow you to make connections you could not make on a frst reading. \nThe appeal will be on a narrow question of law; this means it relates to the construc -\ntion and application of the law to the issue(s) raised on the grounds of appeal. Matters of fact cannot be entertained. This can be important if in your argument you seek to prove a point by reference to statistics etc. These are matters of fact and you may not add to matters of fact. \nHaving thoroughly understood the facts and the procedural history you need to turn \nyour attention to the grounds of appeal. Different moots will in fact differ in the way in which the grounds of appeal are referred to. The grounds can be clearly set out or can be left for the mooters to infer them. \nLegal research \nYour fnal moot speech giving your legal submissions on the ground of appeal is only as good as the quality of your research. Many students see mooting as a display of advo -\ncacy skills and the ability to answer questions under pressure. However, that display relies on a good legal argument based upon competent and extensive research. \n\n--- Page 389 ---\n    \n \n \n \n  358 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \nWhilst a moot problem involves an argument on a narrow ground of appeal based \nexclusively on a point of law it is also necessary for you to understand the wider legal \ncontext of the appeal. This will lead to focused legal research retrieving relevant material. Keep the facts and the grounds of appeal in your mind when researching and engaging in argument construction based on your research. \nYou need to consider in detail all judgments in relevant cases. Do not just read majority \njudgments but carefully consider any minority and dissenting judgments. As a moot prob -\nlem is chosen specifcally because it can be argued ‘either way’, it may be that you will obtain valuable points for your argument in dissenting or majority judgments. Although of course if there is a strong precedent and a clear majority view you will need to consider how best to introduce an argument from minority or dissenting judgments. \nQuestions to inform your legal research \nPrior to commencing your legal research you should write yourself a list of questions based on your analysis of the facts and the grounds of appeal. This is a preliminary list that will inevitably be quite wide and generalised, identifying the main issues. However, you will fnd that as you engage in research some of these questions will be resolved, some will be clearly seen as irrelevant, and a range of more detailed questions will emerge. \nThe statement of current law \nBefore you can begin to work out your argument on the grounds of appeal you need to be certain about what the current law on the matter is. This involves ascertaining and citing relevant legislation and case law. From here you need to go on and identify current controversies or issues in the area. \nHalsbury’s Laws of England \nYou may well recall that the best frst port of call to get a clear view of the current law is Halsbury’s Laws  due to its encyclopaedic nature, which allows you to look up sub -\nject areas of relevance to the moot and obtain the list of up to date relevant legislation and case law. You should additionally note that most judges will actually expect you to cite Halsbury’s Laws  for defnitions of key terms and concepts in the absence of \nlegislation. \nHaving ascertained current law from Halsbury’s  it is essential to ensure you have a \nthorough overview of the area and for this you need to consult a textbook covering the overall subject of the moot. Do make sure that you use the best up to date textbook you can get your hands on. Members of staff teaching the area will be most willing to assist you. \nAs the moot is on a narrow point of law you will not have to research for too long. But \nit must be detailed. The textbook will also contain references and discussion on cases, \n\n--- Page 390 ---\n     ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING 359 \nlegislation and other material of relevance. These should be read and incorporated into \nthe argument. \nCase law \nHalsbury’s  will have identifed the leading cases, but this does not mean that you should \nnot look elsewhere. As noted, read the case law carefully (following the guidance in Chapter 8 ) and if you notice points of relevance for your argument make a note. You \nmust engage with every comment that does not support your case. You need to practise, giving the other side a robust and diffcult time. Many lawyers and students use a two-column table setting out points in a case supporting the appellant and points in a case supporting the respondent. \nThe best way of ensuring that you have a frm grasp of the case is to make a detailed \ncase note. But do not forget to check the current status of the case as it would be grounds for losing the moot if you attempt to rely on an overruled case. \nThe judge will not be impressed if you just cite all possible cases in your legal argu -\nment; you should refer to only those of most relevance. Nor will the judge be impressed if you fail to cite the most correct published version of the case. Errors of citation could be enough to lose you the moot. \nWhen you have the other side’s list of authorities it is a very good idea to make similar \nthorough case notes of those. Although of course your time to do that is limited. \nConstruction of legal argument \nYour legal argument \nHaving completed your research you will have several sets of notes from the various sources you have consulted. Your next task is to use them to address the points on appeal. \nAt the outset of your research you and your fellow teammate will have decided who \nis senior and who is junior counsel and who is dealing with which point. It is important, however, that you both fully understand the entire argument. Two heads are always better than one and your teammate may have comments to make that enable you to improve your submissions, and vice versa. It also will help you deal with judicial interventions and questions that might arise. \nInitially, however, you will each draft your response to the point on appeal that you are \ndealing with taking time to predict what you think your opponent’s response will be. This will enable you to dismiss that response in your speech. \nYou will fnd that there are several legal points you wish to make; these are formally \nreferred to as ‘submissions to the court’, and more commonly as ‘submissions’. Each submission must be supported by primary law as well as necessary secondary texts that support your interpretation. Each submission should add weight to the one before \n\n--- Page 391 ---\n    360 ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING \nand their arrangement is important. You are hoping that the judge will accept each sub -\nmission. When both you and your teammate have completed your written submission \nyou should come together to discuss them, redraft as necessary and ensure you have a streamlined argument. \nBe clear about who speaks when and who says what! \nA moot is a stylised form of argument and we noted turn-taking issues already. When it comes to delivery, senior and junior counsel not only speak in strict rotation, but there are also specifc tasks they must perform. Senior counsel introduces all counsel as well as themselves at the outset of the moot. Junior counsel must not only put their submissions to the second appeal point, but they must also conclude the entire argument presented in the moot. Table 12 .1 sets out the ordering of the legal argument and submissions and \nunder ‘comment’ notes extra detail each counsel must give in addition to setting out the submissions for their specifc ground of appeal. It assumes a situation when each side gives their argument in its entirety. You will, however, recall there can be situations in which the judge prefers to hear senior counsel for both sides, followed by junior counsel for both sides. \nDuring the moot \nCourtroom etiquette \nThroughout the moot, it is important that you behave as if you were in a courtroom – you can lose points if you do not! You will need to stand up when the judge enters, and you will need to stand when speaking to the judge. And, unless you actively want to see by how many points you can lose a moot, do not copy things you watched in (usually American) courtroom dramas: no walking around, no wild gestures, no overly dramatic or emotional speech, and no shouting of the word ‘objection’! \nYou will need to use the proper address for everyone involved. Even if the judge is a \nlecturer you normally call ‘John’, for the duration of the moot, he will need to be either ‘my Lord’ or ‘your Lordship’ for you. Female judges need to be addressed as ‘my Lady’ or ‘your Ladyship’. If you refer to the other participants, you will need to call them ‘my learned friend’ or ‘counsel for the appellant’. \nAnd do not forget how you cite cases: in civil cases, ‘Burns v Simpson’ is read as \n‘Burns and Simpson’; in criminal cases, ‘ R v Terwilliger ’ becomes ‘The Crown against \nTerwilliger’. \nDelivery \nThe points made above on delivery of a presentation apply to a moot speech as well. Try to breathe as calmly as possible, remind yourself to slow down, vary your voice and do \n\n--- Page 392 ---\n     \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING 361 \nTABLE 12.1 ORDERING OF LEGAL ARGUMENT \nSections of Senior counsel Junior counsel Comment \nlegal argument for appellants \nor respondents Appellant goes frst for the appellants and respondents Appellant goes frst \nArgument √ Additionally senior counsel for \non the frst the appellant will frst introduce \ngrounds themselves and all counsel to the \nof appeal judge. \nintroduced. \nLegal \nsubmissions on the frst point outlined and then discussed in detail. √ After listing submissions senior counsel for the appellants will ask the judge if she wishes to hear a brief summary of the facts.

Make notes, but speak \nfreely and establish eye contact with the judges. A moot speech needs to be relatively formal, but you should not fall into the trap of using unnatural language either. \nAgain, it is very important to signpost your arguments, to point out your conclusions, \nand to explain why you are talking about each topic. Central points can be repeated, and nothing underlines an important argument better than a short pause. \nMake sure to practice your speech, and ideally record it and watch it again. As above, \nthis will help you notice habits, fller words or other things that could appear unprofes -\nsional to the judge. \nDealing with judicial interventions \nThe judge can ask the participants questions during the moot. Some judges will listen for a while and ask one or two questions of understanding; others interrupt the mooters on a constant basis. The manner in which you respond to questions establishes your command and comprehension of the legal area and also tests how you withstand pres -\nsure. Listen carefully (do not, under any circumstance, interrupt the judge), think before answering and take your time when you do answer. \nIt is quite likely that the judge may deliberately put forward an interpretation of a point \nof law that you do not agree with. Whilst you must continue to treat the judge with respect, if you do not agree you are allowed to disagree, in the correct format. For example, you could say, ‘Whilst I am of course much obliged to your Lordship for drawing this to my attention, with great respect, I submit that the present case is distinguishable …’ or ‘If I may respectfully say …’. Even if you agree, you should be most polite in your agreement. Firmness and politeness is what is called for. \nDuring questioning, the judge may ask why you chose a particular case or article or \nwhether you knew of another case or article so always when choosing your material be clear about why you choose it. \nCONCLUSION \nPresentations and presentation skills are essential for success at university, but espe -\ncially later in the professional world. This is not only true if you have already decided to become a barrister – in almost every profession, you will be required to present the results of your work in some form. University is the perfect place to build these skills – you are amongst friendly people who are in the same position as you! Make sure to prepare well and to structure a clear, convincing argument, and practice your presentation skills as often as you can, and you will learn a lot from this activity. One of the best ways to practice and to learn is to join your law school’s mooting society and to take part in their internal and external competition. This is also an excellent addition to your CV. \n\n--- Page 394 ---\n     ORAL PRESENTATIONS AND MOOTING 363 \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  A presentation is a time-limited oral argument put forward by a student or a group on \na topic of relevance to your module. It is usually required to be accompanied by the student’s use of audio-visual aids. \n  Presentations can be split into six key stages: understanding the nature of the task, managing the task, research, content, delivery and teamwork (if applicable). \n  If you are working in a team, it is important that everyone understands the timescale and that measures are put in place to deal with those who do not prepare what they have been asked to do. \n  It is absolutely essential to practise the performance of the fnal presentation to ensure that it comes within the time limit. \n  Presentation questions need to be split into discrete issues and sub-questions so that you do not overlook issues. \n  You must engage in focused and careful research. The depth of this research will be determined by the nature of the presentation. \n  You should compile good notes, making sure that they are effciently referenced so the original sources can be quickly located if needed. These should be shared among team members. \n  Ensure you have the time to deliver the argument by appropriately managing time limits. \n  Any required written version of your presentation must contain all sources properly referenced. \n  Practice your delivery in terms of your vocabulary, tone of voice and pacing. \n  Never be tempted to read out your presentation. \n  Speak at a speed appropriate for the audience. Establish eye contact, make pauses and repeat points. \n  Do not overload slides. \n  A moot is a competitive simulation of an appellate court hearing designed to test students’ ability to orally present a well-structured legal argument. \n  Two teams of students role-play senior and junior counsel for the appellants and respondents. \n  The judge determines who wins the legal point and who wins the moot. The judge can also intervene and ask the mooters questions. \n  Counsel give their speeches in a strict order. \n  Mooting is an activity that comes with a range of rules of engagement determining how the moot should be conducted (e.g. issues such as how many cases each side may rely on and the time limits for speeches). These can change between competi -\ntions so do be on guard. \n  Judges will need to be addressed as ‘my Lord’ or ‘my Lady’; other participants are addressed as ‘my learned friend’. \n\n--- Page 396 ---\n13 \n  \n EXAMINATION \nSTRATEGIES \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Competently construct and follow a personal, and achievable, revision timetable. \n  Use your lecturers’ and tutors’ revision sessions to best effect. \n  Competently construct useful revision notes and diagrams. \n  Work towards the best state of mind for the day of the exam. \n  Effciently plan which questions to answer in the exam. \n  Effciently draw planning diagrams for each question to be answered. \n  Understand the best ways of quickly stating information of relevance if you do con -\nsider you are running out of time in the exam. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-16  \n\n--- Page 397 ---\n \n 366 EXAMINATION STRATEGIES  \nINTRODUCTION \nThis chapter aims to demonstrate that it is possible to predict to a certain extent what \nmay or may not appear on the exam paper and to employ the same learnt information economically in different ways for problem and essay questions. It will also give ideas for ensuring that your revision management and in-exam timing does not let you down. It looks at planning revision timetables and tells you what examiners are really looking for. This chapter assists you to reach examinations in a good condition: ft for the task. \nFew students like examinations. While there is a big debate within education concern -\ning whether examinations are a good or a bad method of assessing students, the fact is that this is the main method of assessment that you will encounter on a law degree. Exams require stamina, good knowledge of your own psychology and careful pre-plan -\nning of your revision and in-exam strategies. \nWhether you love, hate or do not mind exams, you may not realise that it is possible to \nprepare strategically for an exam and increase your likelihood of passing and obtaining a good grade. \nFIND OUT ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF YOUR EXAMS \nThere will normally be past examination papers available for the module or course that you are undertaking. If you are studying a new module, running on the degree for the frst time, then it is highly likely that your lecturer will show you a specimen examination paper so that you know what the structure of your exam is likely to be. \nIt is worth noting any patterns coming up in previous exam papers – are certain topics \nalways coming up? Are questions usually essay questions or problem questions? How many questions are there and how many need to be chosen? However, do not make the mistake to rely on the prediction game too much. Lecturers might change the approach to the exam, even if they have been doing more or less the same for the last three years in a row. Looking at previous exam papers can be a helpful indication of what to expect, but it is not necessarily going to be the same. \nYou must be absolutely clear in your mind concerning how much time you are given to \nanswer the exam paper. A misunderstanding about timing can be fatal because you can -\nnot answer all questions required. This is often a reason for failure: even a near-perfect answer to the frst question will not even out a mark of zero for the second. \nTraditional paper-based law exams tend to have essays and legal problem questions \nthat need to be resolved. Some modules, however, do not lend themselves to any other form of question than essays. You must carefully note the rules (called the rubric) at the top of the exam paper to see if you are free to answer any type of question, or whether you need to answer a particular number of each type. For example, you may be required to answer two problem questions and two essays. Or it may be the case that one question \n\n--- Page 398 ---\n   EXAMINATION STRATEGIES 367 \non the exam paper is compulsory and then you have a free choice. Or your exam paper \nmay be divided into sections, in which case you need to be clear about what you are required to do in each section. You must fnd out all of this information weeks before the exam so that you can effciently revise. \nAdditionally you must fnd out if you are allowed to take any books into the exam (this is \ncalled an open book exam). It is rare for level 4 exams (year 1) to be open book, but it can occur. You may fnd that there are optional modules in levels 5 and 6 that are open book. For other exams, you might be allowed to take statute books with you. \nFinally exam papers can be ‘unseen’ and viewed for the frst time in the exam hall, or \n‘pre-seen’, which means they are released days or weeks in advance of the exam. This is less rare in level 4 exams, but you can fnd some departments using this at levels 5 and 6. \nFind out and make a note of the time, type and number of questions to be answered for \neach of your exams and note it down. Ultimately you must be guided by your lecturer, the module leader who will be setting the exam. At university your lecturers set all examina -\ntions for their subjects. \nDRAWING UP A LIST OF POTENTIALLY EXAMINABLE TOPICS \nIt is your job to be sure that you are aware of all potentially examinable topics. Not all topics you study in your module will necessarily be examinable and appear on the paper. Usually, topics that have been the object of continuous assessment will also not be on the exam paper, but this does not have to be the case. Studying past papers can give you an indication of previously featured topics. But do not assume that such topics will necessarily come up again. There is no substitute for surveying carefully the topics that are on your course syllabus for your year of study. It is always advisable to check with your lecturer if you are unclear about examinable topics. Lecturers are unlikely to answer leading questions such as ‘Is the topic of theft coming up on the exam paper?’ A better approach would be to ask, ‘Am I right to assume that theft is an examinable subject that could potentially be on the paper?’ \nWhen you are familiar with the topics on your module you need to look carefully at the \nways in which each topic can appear on the exam papers (essays, problem questions, hybrid questions). Essays and problem questions can be quite wide-ranging so become aware of what is normal on your course. It is also important to realise which topics tend to come up in conjunction with each other. Otherwise, even though you have revised a specifc topic, you may not be able to answer the relevant question because you did not revise the topic that often accompanies it. \nDrawing together information on your examinable topics \nThe best starting points for revision are your lecture and seminar notes. But of course the existence and condition of your notes over the term or year of the course will vary \n\n--- Page 399 ---\n 368 EXAMINATION STRATEGIES  \nenormously. You may have missed some lectures or you may have lost relevant handouts. \nMuch of this basic information should be on your department’s virtual learning environ -\nment (VLE). \nSome of you will have done the reading requested for tutorials and seminars and made \nnotes in the seminar at the time. Some of you will not. You need to sort out what you have, what is missing and see if you can take copies from other students. If you know you have lecture material missing, it makes good sense to plan to do this in the last two weeks of Term 2, before everyone leaves for the vacation. You can then check with friends about missing materials. Many law schools use a VLE and so you can easily download lecture PowerPoints. But do remember that lecturers say much more than is recorded on the PowerPoint (ppt) so it is a good idea to have a copy of the notes from a fellow student. Please choose someone with a reputation for comprehensive lecture notes. \nMaking an inventory of examinable topics so \nthat you can choose your revision topics \nYou should prepare an inventory of examinable topics for each module or course, as \nshown in Table 13 .1, for a hypothetical criminal law course. Your module outlines and syl -\nlabus will outline topics and sub-topics but be sure to consider all the information given to you by lecturers as well. Place the inventory at the beginning of your revision fle for the module so you always know what will be required in the exam. \nFor each module or course you should consider how complete your existing knowl -\nedge is. Go through your inventory of examinable topics and consider each in turn. \nSTRESS AND EXAM PERFORMANCE \nFew students like exams, but you do need to train yourself to be in the best frame of mind to sit them. Examiners do realise that examinations place pressure on students and the ability to deal with this pressure is one of the frst skills you need to work on. Exams require you to display your knowledge: \n  in a specifc area; \n  on a specifc day; \n  at a specifc time. \nThis is why students and lecturers often discuss exam ‘performance’, for exams require \nyou to perform. It does not matter, for the purposes of the exam grade, how good you are before and after the exams. All that counts is what happens during  the exam. That fact \nnaturally causes pressure. Everything rests on your performance on the day. \nWhile students worry ceaselessly about the idea of the exam and what questions \nwill be on the paper, they tend to spend less time concerned about their emotional and \n\n--- Page 400 ---\n   \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n \n     \n \n \n EXAMINATION STRATEGIES 369 \nTABLE 13.1 A SAMPLE HYPOTHETICAL EXAMINABLE TOPICS INVEN -\nTORY CHART FOR CRIMINAL LAW \nCriminal law Type of question Is this an examinable topic? \nTopics covered in the course Problem question Essays Hybrid questions YES – Lecturer has told me NO – Lecturer has told me \nThe contexts of criminal law, \n• history \n• media \n• classifcations \nof criminal acts \n• offcial \nstatistics X √ X √ \nPrinciples and Policies \n• Criminalisation \n• Media \n• Women \n• Actus reus \n• Mens rea X √ X √ \nDefences It will be \ninvolved in all problem questions √ √ possible √ \nMurder √ √ √ √ \nManslaughter √ √ √ √ \nPartial defences; loss of control Diminished responsibility √ √ √ √ \nReform of the law of homicide √ √ √ √ \nGBH – Grievous bodily harm √ √ √ √ \nSexual offences √ √ √ √ \nTheft √ √ √ √ \nBurglary √ √ √ √ \nHandling √ √ √ √ \nRobbery X X X √ \nCriminal damage √ √ √ √ \nGuest lecture: Honour killings X X X See next column NB: We have been \ntold that it may be used to inform any essay questions on contexts, reform etc. in the area of murder/ manslaughter \n\n--- Page 401 ---\n \n \n  \n  370 EXAMINATION STRATEGIES  \nphysical state on the day of the exam. You need therefore to get in training and practise \nways of defusing excessive stress, remaining in good health, studying consistently and developing a good examination strategy that works for you. It is a good idea to face your fears about failing the exam head-on. \nSo – what happens if you fail? Well, life goes on, and you will plan to take the resit. \nAdditionally you probably will not fail because if you are reading this you are doing all in your power to plan to succeed. \nASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT EXAMS ARE TESTING \nThere are some right and wrong assumptions concerning what the exam is testing. Some assumptions are true for some disciplines and not for others. You should take time to consider what your assumptions are. Read through the list of assumptions in Table 13 .2 \nand tick the ‘yes’ or ‘no’ box to indicate whether you share each assumption or not. \nNow go through the discussion below of each assumption and see where you were \nright and where you may have been wrong. Unconsciously your assumptions can deter -\nmine your attitude to revision, and if you only have a range of partially correct assump -\ntions you may cause yourself diffculties in the exam. In reading through the explanations below you should begin to understand far more about what it is that the examiner is looking for. \nAssumption 1: exams are a test of how \nmuch information I can remember \nTo a limited extent examinations are a test of what you can remember. As you can only \nmake links between the question and what you know, your memorised knowledge base is an important aspect of your examination performance. But your rote learning, or \nTABLE 13.2 TESTING YOUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EXAMS \nASSUMPTION YES NO \nAssumption 1: Exams are a test of how much information I can remember \nAssumption 2:  Exams are a test of the quality of my reasoning powers \nAssumption 3: Exams are a test of my techniques for answering \nexamination questions \nAssumption 4:  Exams are a test of how well I can take apart an \nexamination question Assumption 5:  Exams test how quickly I can write in the time allowed \nAssumption 6:  Exams test how well I can argue \nAssumption 7:  Exams test how clever I am \n\n--- Page 402 ---\n   \n EXAMINATION STRATEGIES 371 \nmemorised work is only the beginning of your answer. The examiner wants to see the \nproper use of your memorised information to form arguments in answer to the question. \nLaw exams require, in addition to knowledge of topics in set texts and articles, that \nyou remember the detail of cases and legislation. As you need to know the case name, the court it was decided in, the names of the judges, the year of the case, the facts of the case and the reasoning in the case, memory is important. But the examiner wishes to see you demonstrate that you can use this knowledge of cases to form arguments. You do not get credit for laboriously setting out the details of irrelevant cases. Nor can you get full credit for relevant case details that you do not properly apply to a problem question. This merely demonstrates a lack of understanding. Quality  in the application of \nyour knowledge will achieve higher marks than a quantity  of memorised learning being \nrandomly listed without application to the question in hand. The careful deployment of a few leading cases and/or academic texts (depending on whether you are dealing with an essay or problem question) appropriately argued and discussed demonstrates confdent understanding and application of knowledge to the issue at hand. \nAssumption 2: exams are a test of the \nquality of my reasoning powers \nThis is an absolutely correct assumption. The examiner is testing your reasoning powers \nand is interested in observing, through your answer, how you think. The examiner is look -\ning to see you effciently and confdently demonstrate the application of your knowledge in the construction of arguments. You need to choose relevant cases, legal rules and academic texts from your memory and use them to back up your arguments. \nAssumption 3: exams are a test of my techniques \nfor answering examination questions \nAgain this is absolutely correct. The examiner is looking to see if you can sort the relevant \nfrom the irrelevant and identify a good range of the correct issues. The examiner wishes to see you demonstrate that you can understand the topic and can think critically, write appropriately in terms of grammar, structure and spelling, and write confdent and appro -\npriate arguments in the time limit set by the exam. \nAssumption 4: exams are a test of how well I \ncan take apart an examination question \nYes, they are, and this ability is an essential skill. Without it you may well miss important \naspects of the question and will not be able to properly answer it. You could then end up discussing irrelevant matters and simply writing down everything you learnt, without customising it to suit the question asked. Examiners dislike this very much and it can lose you marks. \n\n--- Page 403 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n 372 EXAMINATION STRATEGIES  \nAssumption 5: exams test how quickly I \ncan write in the time allowed \nThe answer is both yes and no. You are only given a limited time to answer questions in an \nexam and part of a successful exam strategy is being able to provide a competent answer and keep to that time limit. This is dependent on your knowledge and skills, but also your ability to write quickly and legibly. You need to know how much you can write in the time allotted for each question. The key here is to practise writing answers to past or mock exams using the time allocation that is given in the exam. \nTime management in the examination is an important aspect of examination perfor -\nmance. You may know everything necessary but fail the exam because you just run out of time. Practise timed essay and problem questions, just as you would practise for sing -\ning, dancing or sport. In this way you increase your stamina, your speed of thought, your recall, and your handwriting speed. Legibility of handwriting is essential so that the marker can read your answer. All of your revision is useless if your handwriting cannot be read by the examiner. So practise fast legible writing. Quantity does not  necessarily mean quality. \nAssumption 6: exams test how well I can argue \nAbsolutely, the quality of your argument construction can increase your grades at the top end of performance or make the difference between a pass or fail at the bottom. All exam essays and problem questions require a well-constructed argument. The competency of your relevant  argument backed by proofs measured together with the breadth of your \nreading and legibility of your writing determines your grade. \nAssumption 7: exams test how clever I am \nIt would be better to state that exams test your learning so far on the course. As such it can be said they test the acquisition of skills, knowledge and intelligence. However, they do much more than just measure intelligence. Exams assess a range of skills from memory and the ability to deconstruct questions correctly, through to rule handling and rule application to fnal construction of argument using sources to answer the question. Figure 13 .1 summarises the full range of skills that examiners are looking for. \nWHAT DOES YOUR UNIVERSITY LECTURER EXPECT \nYOU TO DEMONSTRATE IN YOUR EXAM? \nMarkers of exams expect your answers to demonstrate that you have read: \n  relevant chapters in your set textbook; \n  relevant law cases and statutes, as referred to in your set texts, lectures and semi -\nnars or located as a result of your independent study; \n\n--- Page 404 ---\n   \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n   EXAMINATION STRATEGIES 373 \nFigure 13.1 The range of skills that examiners look for \n  a modest selection of academic journal articles: two or three articles for each topic if \npossible (these are to be used for essay questions only); \n  relevant chapters in academic books. \nAny essay with only primary law sources (cases and statutes) or just textbooks is lacking in competency. You are expected to use these together  with academic materials such as \nacademic journal articles or scholarly monographs. These academic sources are essen -\ntial in an essay to back up your ideas and arguments. In the absence of any sources at all it will be diffcult to reach a pass mark, but the addition of academic and legal sources immediately begins to give access to higher results. Nobody expects you to remember full references in an exam. However, remembering an author’s name and a few key arguments from an article or book will be very helpful for your arguments in the essay question. \nLegal problem solutions do not require reference to academic articles/books. Indeed \nto do so is unacceptable unless the relevant text has been the object of ‘judicial notice’ in a case. Judicial notice describes a situation in which a judge openly refers to a writer in his or her judgment endorsing it as a source consulted in answering a diffcult point. \nIt is unlikely that you will obtain a pass mark in a legal problem question if you do not \nrefer to cases and to statutes. \nWith regard to statutes you must know: \n  the correct name of the statute; \n  year of enactment; \n  the sections, sub-sections, paragraphs, and sub-paragraphs of the areas you have studied; \n  the content of relevant sections, etc. \n\n--- Page 405 ---\n \n     374 EXAMINATION STRATEGIES  \nFor cases you need to be aware of: \n  the names of judges; \n  the facts; \n  arguments presented by judges; \n  the grounds of the action or the appeal and the outcome; \n  the court; \n  the year. \nFor each revision topic ensure that you draw up a list of relevant references to journals \nand cases/legislation from your lecture and seminar material. Pay particular attention to any handouts given out in-exam/revision sessions. When you have decided what topics you will concentrate on you can then read selectively. Ideally, however, you will have ear -\nlier notes from your reading of these for seminars and assessments. \nTHE ART OF CAREFUL EXAM PREPARATION – REVISION \nNote that the word revision means re -vision, i.e. re-seeing, looking again at work done. If \nyou neglected to do the work in the frst place, you will not be engaging in revision; you will be learning for the frst time. This generally takes longer than standard revision, so if you have missed material earlier in your course you will need to build extra time into your revision schedule. \nIt is not possible to overestimate the importance of planned, strategic topic picking \nand then careful, effcient revision of those topics. Once you know what examiners are looking for, you can use that information to strategically revise your work. \nPreparing for examinations requires time, peer support from other students in the \nsame position and access to your lecturers, seminar leaders or subject tutors (at their allotted revision times) in order to ask any worrying questions you may have. Lecturers are busy people: be sure to respect their revision programme for the relevant module and their offce hours. Do not expect their time and attention at other times due to your own disorganisation. \nYou need to plan revision time carefully, using it effciently and effectively. It can be \neasy to do too little at the start and then too much too late. Or you can spend too much time on one area and miss the rest. Or even do too much revision for too long, effectively cancelling out that work by becoming exhausted, stressed and over-stretched. However, if you address revision properly and pace yourself, you will be able to organise yourself appropriately. \nTo achieve optimum output and pacing it is important to engage in revision time man -\nagement. Otherwise you may reach the examination with large amounts of material that has not been revised. Or large amounts of rote learning insuffciently understood and ‘digested’ so that you cannot properly and effectively deploy it. \n\n--- Page 406 ---\n   \n  EXAMINATION STRATEGIES 375 \nPreparing a revision timetable \nThe following discussion assumes an end of academic year programme of examinations. \nAdjust timings if your exams are scheduled at other times of the year. \nRevision time management is an important aspect of ensuring peak examination per -\nformance. It is essential to draw up a revision timetable to monitor your progress and include in it every topic and subtopic you intend to revise. You should then annotate it with what you actually did revise. So, by the time of the exams, you know what you have not revised as well as what you have. It must also include times of your actual exams. You \nshould also drop into that timetable paid employment and relaxation time. \nPlanned revision falls into two sections: \n  your main revision programme; \n  your ‘recapping revision programme’ in the day or days before the exam according to your preference. \nIn order to plot the basics on your revision timetable you frst of all need to know your exam timetable and the spacing between your exams as this information predetermines your main, and your recapping, revision programmes. \nYou need to decide how many hours a standard revision session will be, and during \nwhat hours you will timetable revision. You can always make changes but you should start with a defnite plan. The division of the day into morning, afternoon and evening sessions is a good place to begin. To assist you, in Figure 13 .2 a chart has been set up that mirrors \nthese frst three natural dividers of the day (morning, afternoon and evening) to determine your revision sessions. \nYou will note that there is a one-hour break between each session, and each of the \nmorning and afternoon sessions has two 15-minute breaks in the middle. Breaks are essential; otherwise, you will grind to a halt and lose motivation. \nTable 13 .3 sets out a hypothetical revision timetable that also includes paid employ -\nment, relaxation and exams. This revision table is for a hypothetical period 1 May to 15 June and covers nearly seven weeks. You may need longer and may need to use dif -\nferent dates. It allows for 236.5 revision hours spread over 76 revision sessions. \nFigure 13.2 Revision session timing \n\n--- Page 407 ---\n   \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n 376 EXAMINATION STRATEGIES  \nTABLE 13.3 SAMPLE REVISION TIMETABLE\nSESSIONS TIME MON TUES WEDS THURS FRI SAT SUN TOTALS \nWeek\n1 MAY 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \n1 Morning 9–1 3.5 hours 3.5 hours REU\\X 3.5 hours 3.5 hours PAIDWORK REU\\X Revision Hours39 RevisionSessions 12 Paid Work hours Relaxhours 122Afternoon 2–6 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours \n3 Evening 7–9 PAIDWORK PAIDWORK 2 hours REU\\X PAIDWORK RELAX 2 hours \nWeek2 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 \n1 Morning 9–1 PAIDWORK 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours PAIDWORK REU\\X Revision Hours35.5 Revision Sessions 11 Paid Work hours Relax hours 10 2Afternoon 2–6 PAIDWORK 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours \n3 Evening 7–9 RELAX PAIDWORK 2 hours REU\\X PAIDWORK RELAX 2 hours \nWeek3 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 \n1 Morning 9–1 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours PAIDWORK REU\\X Revision Hours41 Revision Sessions 13 Paid Work hours Relax hours 8 2Afternoon 2–6 3.5 hours PAIDWORK 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours \n3 Evening 7–9 RELAX PAIDWORK 2 hours 2 hours PAIDWORK REU\\X 2 hours \nWeek4 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 \n\n--- Page 408 ---\n      \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  EXAMINATION STRATEGIES 377 1 Morning 9–1 PAID\nWORK 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours PAIDWORK REU\\X Revision Hours36 RevisionSessions 12 Paid Work hours Relaxhours 10 \n2Afternoon 2–6 PAIDWORK 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours RELAX PAIDWORK 3.5 hours \n3 Evening 7–9 2 hours PAIDWORK 2 hours 2 hours PAIDWORK REU\\X 2 hours \nSESSIONS TIME MON TUES WEDS THURS FRI SAT SUN TOTALS \nWeek5 29 30 31 JUNE 1 2 3 4 \n1 Morning 9–1 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours PAIDWORK RELAX Revision Hours44 Revision Sessions 14 Paid Work hours1 Relax hours 6 2Afternoon 2–6 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours PAID WORK 3.5 hours \n3 Evening 7–9 PAIDWORK PAIDWORK 2 hours 2 hours PAIDWORK RELAX 2 hours \nWeek6 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \n1 Morning 9–1 RELAX 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours EXAM PAIDWORK RELAX Revision Hours31.5 Revision Sessions 9 Paid Work hours £ Relax hours22 Exam session 1 2Afternoon 2–6 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours PAID WORK 3.5 hours \n3 Evening 7–9 RELAX RELAX RELAX RELAX RELAX RELAX RELAX \nWeek7 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \n1 Morning 9–1 EXAM EXAM EXAM 3.5 hours 3.5 hours FINISHED Revision Hours19.5 Revision Sessions 6 Paid Work hours0 Relax hours6 EXAMS 5 sessions 2Afternoon 2–6 EXAM \n3.5 hours 3.5 hours 3.5 hours EXAM \n3 Evening 7–9 2 hours RELAX RELAX RELAX FINISHED \n\n--- Page 409 ---\n \n \n \n \n 378 EXAMINATION STRATEGIES  \nIf the mere sight of it is liable to depress you, move on to the next section and come \nback to it another time. \nThe givens are put in frst, the dates of your exams and the timings of any paid work, \nor any other occasions when you cannot study, for example, family birthdays and spe -\ncial occasions. Relaxation time is also allocated on most days. The third session (see Figure 13 .2) ends at 9 pm so relaxation time is always available after that time. You can \ncustomise the sessions and times to suit you. You need to work with your best times, but be aware that there will be times when you have to revise when you are tired. When you are designing your revision plan do not leave too much to the last minute. You need to know yourself, act wisely and plan effectively so that you can draw up a realistic plan and stick to it. It may be a good idea to try and cut back on paid employment during revision and exams, if your pocket and your employer can cope. \nIt is sensible to allocate a specifed revision session to each module. You may allocate \nless time to those with lower exam weightings. Whether you put a large number of same-subject revision together or split it up throughout your timetable is up to you. If you get easily bored by revision you will relate better to change. \nA comments column allows for working out the weekly revision hours and study ses -\nsions and for any other notes, for instance, if you have missed a session. \nCompiling the list of topics that you will revise \nVery few students can learn everything well, and attempting to learn everything can result in mediocre and patchy knowledge that reduces all of your revision to a superfcial level. It is, however, possible to learn a few topics very well indeed. Since some exams are designed so that a limited series of topics come up, many students will select the topics that they are going to revise, leaving some topics to one side. This process is part of the exam game plan or strategy. Topic picking is a diffcult issue. Attitudes to it among both students and academics vary. \nAbove all else topic picking involves knowing all the examinable topics in your module \nand understanding your own strengths and weaknesses. It may also involve predict -\ning what may, or may not, come up in the exam. You need to listen to the information given to you by your lecturer and read what is said about the exam in your departmental and module subject guides and any module revision guides issued by your lecturer or department. \nThe next step is to make strategic choices about the number of topics that you can \nrevise in each of the subjects that you are studying. Only you can decide the number of topics to pick. You need to know how the topics splinter into a range of sub-topics (for example, theft splits into issues of dishonesty that can be the object of an essay, as well as general problem questions). You also need to know the range of topics that could come up together. Here learning just one topic could mean that you cannot answer the question. For example, if you revise murder and not the partial defences, or indeed do not revise manslaughter, you might have diffculty in a problem question designed to test \n\n--- Page 410 ---\n   \n       EXAMINATION STRATEGIES 379 \nyour knowledge of whether the defendant may be liable for murder or manslaughter, or \nwhether a partial defence applies to murder. \nYou need to make sensible decisions. If you are convinced a topic will come up, but it \nis a topic that you struggle with and have never understood, think carefully before choos -\ning to revise it. Even if the topic is guaranteed to be in the exam, is there any guarantee that you will be able to understand it before the exam? \nFrom the inventory of topics that you draw up for each module you will need to con -\nsider your state of understanding of topics and then choose those that you feel most con -\nfdent about in terms of understanding. Obviously if some topics will form the foundation of a compulsory question you have no choice. Table 13 .4 sets out a potential ‘personal \nknowledge checklist’ and again uses criminal law as our specimen module. \nIn our example in Table 13 .4 there are several areas that have not yet been covered by \nthe student. There are also topics the student fnds ‘confusing’. They will need to decide whether it is worth spending the time getting up to speed on these topics or whether they should leave them. When making decisions about which topics to cover if you have a free choice and know what tends to come up and what does not you should make fnal choices based on your strengths and weaknesses. Also too many topics may be chosen: it looks like possibly nine areas could be chosen. Yet the paper contains eleven questions and students only need to answer two. \nThe value of this exercise lets you know if you are trying to cover too much, diluting the \nability to learn more information about fewer topics in more depth. \nFor every topic that you do cover, it is best to prepare for both an essay and a problem \nquestion scenario, as you cannot always predict how a question will arise on the exam paper. Problem questions require quite extensive primary sources of law. Essay ques -\ntions require academic sources and it is often necessary to discuss primary sources of law. It is important to realise that the same basic information is needed to do a problem question and an essay question and it is best to revise a topic in order to answer whatever type of question comes up. \nAssisting your memory \nOnce you have collated a full set of revision material from: \n  lecture notes; \n  seminar notes; \n  private study notes; \n  case notes; \n  articles/books. \nyou should condense all the information into key point form. You then need to ensure you \nunderstand these key points and can remember them. \nMemorising these key points can be diffcult. However, although law exams cannot be \nsimply passed by rote memory, you have to engage in memory tasks to commit to your \n\n--- Page 411 ---\n \n  \n \n \n   \n  \n     \n \n \n 380 EXAMINATION STRATEGIES  \nTABLE 13.4 SAMPLE KNOWLE\nTOPICS DGE SUMMARY FOR EXAMINABLE \nCriminal law Coverage Type of question I can do Comment \nExaminable Topics Problem question Essay \nThe contexts of criminal law, \n• history \n• media \n• classifcations of \ncriminal acts \n• offcial statistics x – – But I only want to do an essay on classifcations of criminal acts. \nPrinciples and Policies \n• Criminalisation \n• Media \n• Women \n• Actus reus \n• Mens rea √ – √ I only want to do \ncriminalisation.

You can \nengage in several different approaches for revision; some may not suit you, but ideally you should engage in all of them. They assist in committing information to memory and putting you in a good position to pass the exam. Table 13 .5 shows a range of different \nactivities that relate to the learning styles discussed in Chapter 5 . You will have your own \npreference for what works best. \nHow long before the exam should I start revising? \nThis is your decision and is infuenced by a range of factors, including how fast you work, how consistently you have studied all year, how much new understanding you need to acquire and how many topics you struggle with. It is quite possible that when you have done your revision programme you will fnd that you have differing amounts of revision to do for each exam. \n  Do not underestimate  how much you need to do. \n  Do not overestimate what you can do in the time you have. \n  Pace your revision . If you push yourself too much and become too tired your brain will \n‘switch off’ and you will fnd it extremely diffcult to keep going with your revision. If \nyou feel this happening, stop and take time to develop a more effcient plan. \n  Sleep . The temptation to revise late into the night is strong for some at exam time, but \nit is important to ensure you have enough sleep. Your brain is your major asset to be used in passing the exams. It needs sleep to be replenished. \n  From your inventory of topics for the course you will need to know which ones you can potentially tackle. \nRevision activities and how to keep motivated \n(boredom sabotages revision!) \nFor many students, revision is not only stressful (because it reminds you that exams are \nlooming); it is also boring. This means that however hard you try you may not remember what you revise as your brain has switched itself off. \nTo avoid getting bored, fnd the revision activity that best suits you. There are many \ndifferent revision activities to choose from, as shown in Figure 13 .3. All of these make \nrevision active. Consider whether any of these would work for you. \nTHE DAY OF THE EXAMINATION \nYou have done all the revising you can and now it is the day of the exam. It is worth think -\ning about what you need to know on the day and what habits you should try to acquire beforehand. Figure 13 .4 lists some ways of staying unfustered and relaxed so you are \nable to perform at your best on the day. \n\n--- Page 413 ---\n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n   382 EXAMINATION STRATEGIES  \nTABLE 13.5 LEARNING STYLES AND MEMORY TACTICS FOR ENHANC -\nING YOUR REVISION \nLEARNING \nSTYLES EXAMPLE ACTIVITIES \nKINESTHETIC \nLEARNING STRATEGIES • Link the information you are learning to doing different things. For \ninstance, you could try learning different topics in different places to help recall. \nVISUAL LEARNING STRATEGIES • Construct diagrams of interconnections. \n• Construct a mind map. \n• Draw symbols or even pictures to help you remember cases.

Check your answers in your textbook. \n• Remember that all of the conventions for good writing apply in an exam. • Check your answer for legible handwriting. Ask a friend if they can read it. • Check that you have provided evidence for each point in your argument. • Lecturers will often have specifc timescales within which they will look at \nspecimen answers so it is worth asking in good time if they will consider your draft answer. \nIf you fnally realise that you have chosen to not properly prepare, then there is no point \nover-stressing; you can only follow through with the exam and hope for some luck. \nStrategies during the examination \nIt is important that you have a pre-plan of how you will divide up your time during the \nexamination. Before the exam you need to have practised effciently, producing draft answers in the actual time you will have in the exam. \n\n--- Page 414 ---\n   \n          \n  EXAMINATION STRATEGIES 383 \nFigure 13.3 Revision activities \nFigure 13.4 Good habits on exam day \nIf you have a two-hour exam and only need to answer two questions you should allow \nreading time of ten minutes at the start, and ten minutes for edits, proofng review at \nthe end. This means you have around 1 hour 40 minutes to write your two answers (50 minutes each). Some universities allow 15 minutes reading time under exam conditions immediately prior to the commencement of the exam. \nBelow are some suggestions for dividing up your time in a two-hour exam without \nreading time prior to its commencement. \n(1) The frst ten minutes: read the whole paper through carefully and decide which ques -\ntions you will answer. Check the length of the exam and the number of questions you are told to answer; check for compulsory questions. Make sure you know which questions are ‘either/or’ questions and which are asking you to do both parts of a question. Think about what the examiner is looking for in each question and whether you can deliver it. Check that you have properly explored the language of the question \n\n--- Page 415 ---\n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  384 EXAMINATION STRATEGIES  \nso that you do not miss questions you are able to answer, or miss points in the ques -\ntions you have decided to answer. \n(2) The next ten minutes could be used to plan answers to all of your chosen questions, \nor you could start your frst question, planning each question as you go. Whichever \nprocess you use, planning time has to be incorporated into the time you have allot -\nted for writing your answer to each question. Do not be tempted into writing without considered pre-planning of the question on a separate piece of paper. You can plan by making notes or drawing a diagram, and before the exam you need to think about how you will do this, and practise it when you do specimen papers under exam conditions. Invariably there will be a hierarchy in the questions you have picked to answer, with some topics you know well and some less well. Be rigorous, however, about moving on to the next question at the end of your allotted time for each ques -\ntion. This will open up the next set of marks for you. One brilliant answer rarely makes up for missed questions. Even a mediocre answer joined to a great one can push you into the next grade band. But if you continue to make your great question greater, you are not really opening up the marks available to you. Each question has a set number of marks. \n(3) During the planning and writing process constantly refer back to the question to make absolutely certain you are addressing it. You are being tested on your struc -\ntured and methodical approach to the questions you answer, as well as on your knowledge and its application to the questions. \n(4) When structuring your essay make sure that each of your answers has a brief intro -\nduction, a main body and a conclusion. Also that you refer to academic journals in your answer, plus refer to any appropriate cases or legislation. \n(5) Structuring problem answers  Give a brief introduction stating the ambit of the problem. \n Do a fow chart of facts in your rough work to guide you. \n Answer each head of liability for each party separately. \n Ensure you make clear the rules that are relevant. \n State legal areas involved. \n Clearly set out issues. \n Apply statutes and cases methodically to each element. \n Do not forget defences unless told not to deal with them. \n Conclude for each  party in relation to each  head of liability. \nOnly refer to cases and legislation; do not refer to any academic text unless  it has \nreceived judicial notice in a case. \n(6) Rigidly stick to your pre-planned timing for each question. \n(7) Present your work so that it is easy for the examiner to follow, using the rules pre -\nferred in your department for drawing attention to law cases and statutes (for exam -\nple, underlining them). \n(8) Do leave time in the last ten minutes of the exam to recheck your whole paper for spelling and grammar.

This simple error can turn a great point into an incomprehensible point. \nCheck that all your sentences make sense. Neatly  correct any problems. Make sure \nall rough work has a line drawn through it and you have correctly labelled your ques -\ntions. This includes labelling parts of questions. If you think of extra materials or points, annotate your question: examiners will follow clear instructions from the exam candidate. You might also fnd that you remember a point of argument, or a case, or an article that you had originally forgotten when answering the question. You can always add this at the end (ensuring you signpost the examiner to the additional material with an asterisk or some other device). \n(9) At the end of the exam it may be a good idea to avoid those who are dissecting the paper to see what everyone else did, discussing whether they are wrong or right. This could needlessly upset you and even unnerve you before your next exam. \nCONCLUSION \nTo perform successfully in the exam requires sustained organisation on your part. You need to understand the structure of the exam and its relationship to the structure of your course. You need to understand what topics in your course are examinable topics that may come up in the exam. You also need to know your own capability with regard to the course, what you do understand and what you do not understand. This will enable you to properly devise a revision timetable, uniting understanding of the topics with any neces -\nsary rote learning required to apply the law and your academic sources to exam ques -\ntions. Having properly revised you can then plan your in-exam strategy. \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  Remember that exams are not unexpected events for which you cannot plan. It is essential to plan for them well in advance. \n  Be sure that you know what exams are designed to test. \n  Revision skills and tactics in the exam are an integral part of your skills. Indeed they \nare the summation of your year’s work. \n  Ensure you know the examinable syllabus and have an idea of your competency in each topic. \n  Be quite clear about how fast you write and what you can write in the time of the exam. \n  Ensure your handwriting remains legible when writing to time limits under exam con -\nditions by practising in advance answering questions in the required time. \n  Revise strategically, engaging in topic picking if the exam is not composed of all compulsory questions. \n  Keep a careful and disciplined watch on the time during the exam. \n\n--- Page 417 ---\n 386 EXAMINATION STRATEGIES  \n  Read the exam paper carefully and choose questions wisely. \n  Read and follow all instructions. \n  Answer the required number of questions. \n  Plan each answer. \n  Re-read each of your answers for sense, spelling and errors towards the end of the \nexam. \n  Stay calm – otherwise your ability to think will be impaired. \n  After the exam draw a line under it and move on to the next one. \n\n--- Page 418 ---\n PART 4 \nSKILLS FOR \nRESOLVING DISPUTES \nThe expected learning outcomes of any law degree include an expectation that as a law \nstudent you have competently learned how to analyse and synthesise material to con -\nstruct and sustain, for example, a coherent argument (as covered previously in Part 3) and also learned how to problem-solve effectively. As a law undergraduate, the need to g\nrasp a broad range of skills to prepare yourself for graduate employment is emphasised \nin Part 4. This also refects the willingness of law schools to embrace the introduction of more progressive curriculum strategies, for example the teaching of dispute resolution, which enables your law school to produce effective learning, teaching and assessment practices and curriculum design for transformation. \nTh\ne topics which are covered in this part also refect the fact that some law schools \nhave placed an emphasis on ‘learning law in context’; this has been done through the inclusion of elements of socio-legal education and by utilising practical skills-based learning. \nThe study of dispute resolution as part of the socio-legal education agenda refects \nthe prevailing attitudes to dispute resolution and the prominent place it occupies within the feld of legal practice and is therefore considered to be an important focus for law students’ studies. Learning how to resolve disputes also provides a perfect environment for graduate skills acquisition. \nChapter 14 ‘Negotiation’ not only enables you to gain a sound theoretical understand -\ning of what is now considered to be a recognised academic discipline subject studied by students of both law and business alike, but also gives you the opportunity to acquire some valuable transferable skills. Oral skills competence and confdence in public speak -\ning as well as an appreciation of the interpersonal skills, complement other academic skills which you will be developing such as issues analysis and argument construction. \nIn Chapter 15 ‘Mediation’, you will be introduced to a process of alternative dispute \nresolution which now forms an important part of the dispute resolution continuum and one that has become accepted by lawyers as a viable process for resolving civil dis -\nputes. Communication skills and their importance for effective mediation is emphasised and again the study of mediation presents the opportunity for the acquisition of valuable transferable skills through engagement in role-play simulation exercises. \nThe consolidation of graduate legal skills can also be found in Chapter 16 ‘Drafting’, \nwhich enables students to put their writing skills into practice through the assimilation of \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-17  \n\n--- Page 419 ---\n    388 SKILLS FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES \nfacts and the construction of a piece of writing, whether that be a letter or a more formal \nlegal document, with clarity, accuracy and with the intention of the purpose of that draft -\ning exercise always in mind. \nBy the end of \nPart 4 you should feel confdent in being able to understand the basic \ntheoretical concepts and some key practical skills elements of both negotiation and mediation. You should also be able to approach and successfully complete a rudimentary drafting exercise with more confdence. \n\n--- Page 420 ---\n14 \n  \n NEGOTIATION \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Develop personal confdence in speaking in public. \n  Put into practice general oral skills such as volume of voice, tone of voice, body posi -\ntion, eye contact, pacing. \n  Appreciate the skills requirements of negotiation (analysis of issues, client instruc -\ntions, negotiation positions, team strategies, interpersonal skills, legal research, note \ntaking, referencing, argument construction, in-negotiation strategies). \n  Understand some of the theory associated with the process of negotiation. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-18  \n\n--- Page 421 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n 390 NEGOTIATION  \nINTRODUCTION \nNegotiation is one of several oral skills exercises that you may be required to engage with, \nnot only for non-assessed skills development but also in relation to formal assessment. It depends on a fne balance of personal research, personal oral skills competency and good interpersonal teamwork skills. While mooting represents the litigation paradigm and the concept of court-based dispute resolution, negotiation introduces the ideology of alterna -\ntive dispute resolution (ADR). This is the alternative  to going to court or moving through the \ncourt trial process.\n1 While the aim of a moot is to win (as is the aim of a court case), the aim \nof a negotiation is to reach a settlement or a compromise with the other party. \nAs with mooting the discussion is conducted according to a range of agreed rules of \nengagement concerning who speaks frst and appropriate turn-taking. However, the set -\nting is less formal. \nWhat is negotiation? \nThe process of negotiation may involve two or more parties or representatives. Any nego -\ntiation will require some form of communication between the parties; this may take writ -\nten form or spoken form, either through some form of telecommunication process or as a face to face meeting. In any negotiation there may be mixed motives, interests, require -\nments and goals, both conficting and common. For a negotiation to be successful, there has to be mutual movement from initial positions as well as joint or reciprocal action. The goal of any negotiation is to reach an agreement, but this is by no means guaranteed and there are more than one set of terms or outcomes which are usually possible. \nNegotiation involves identifcation of the following: \n  Issues (in common/which differ); \n  Needs and interests; \n  Options for agreement. \nThe reasons why people negotiate are to accomplish goals. It may be to create or gain something new, for example, a relationship, a partnership, an entity or achieve a transac -\ntion. It may be that the parties to the negotiation hope to resolve a dispute or confict. Essentially, people enter into negotiations because they think that they can use some form of infuence to be better off with the intention of reaching an agreement instead of engaging in a public fght. \nAt the academic stage of legal education, negotiation, like mooting, can be conducted \nas a role play between two teams, who act as legal advisors for the respective clients in a fctitious legal dispute. Unlike mooting, however, the subject matter of a negotiation can be far broader and conceptually different. \n1 A DR encompasses not only negotiation but also other processes such as mediation (when a trained facili -\ntator allows the parties to interact with each other and reach a resolution) and arbitration. You may learn \nmore about it on your English legal system course. Mediation will be considered in Chapter 15 . \n\n--- Page 422 ---\n  \n \n \n NEGOTIATION 391 \nStudents are seated, usually around a table, and while the language is formal and \nrespectful, primary legal sources are not quoted and speeches are not given. There is a conversational dialogue between the two sides as each seeks to implement their pre-planned strategies for obtaining the best deal for their client in light of their client’s instructions. \nRange of skills required for negotiation \nAs you may by now expect, negotiation requires you to integrate a large number of skills, including: \n  personal management of the task; \n  team management of the task and interpersonal skills; \n  research; \n  handling primary legal rules; \n  managing facts and instructions from clients, and other documentation; \n  competent note taking; \n  writing pre-negotiation strategies; \n  competent reporting back to the team; \n  argument construction; \n  oral skills; \n  handling the unforeseen within the negotiation; \n  competent critical review post-negotiation. \nThe skills you bring with you to negotiation \nIt is highly likely that you come to the exercise of negotiation with some naturally \nacquired skills relevant to the task. These will have been deployed and developed just by being in the world, as part of a group of friends or family, in school, university or in the workplace. \nNegotiation is part of everyday life, and you will undoubtedly have engaged in the \nprocess of negotiation at some time or another, so consider the last time that you made a bargain with someone to get something that only they could give you. You probably gave something or offered to do something as an incentive to get what you wanted from the other person. Maybe you wanted time off from your part-time job but thought your boss might refuse. You will have carefully chosen your time to ask for leave and prob -\nably thought of what you could offer in return. Maybe there is a time in the week when you knew that your boss had trouble getting his staff to work. You might have suggested that if he gave you the time off that you wanted, then you would do one or two of those problem shifts straight away, or on your return to work. This situation would be a clas -\nsic example of principled bargaining or negotiation because you need to continue your relationship with your boss. \n\n--- Page 423 ---\n \n \n  \n 392 NEGOTIATION  \nAll of this natural everyday activity involves fexibility. You need to think in advance \nabout what barriers you might have to overcome before you get the ‘yes’, the object that \nyou want. Often you may need to give something in order to get what you want; in nego -\ntiation theory this is often termed as making a concession. Usually you need to have an understanding of how the other person may be thinking, how they will view your request, what it is that you think they may object to, and how you can deal with this. All of this natu -\nral experience can be used to help you gain an understanding of formal legal negotiation. \nNegotiation theory is now the subject of academic discourse, and Fisher and Ury, in \ntheir seminal negotiation text Getting to Yes , suggest that your approach to any negotia -\ntion should include four principles; as best as you can, you should separate the people from the problem; focus on interests, not positions; invent options for mutual gain and insist on using objective criteria.\n2 \nTHE TWO MAIN FORMS OF NEGOTIATION \nNegotiation can take one of two major forms, positional and principled negotiation. Each form requires negotiators to adopt different stances or approaches. You can often deter -\nmine which type of negotiation is called for from the information you are given regarding your client’s instructions to you. However, do not be caught unawares. While your cli -\nent may think the negotiation is of one type, the other party may have different ideas. Negotiation approach or style can often shape the negotiation and determine the kind of agreement reached. \nPositional negotiation \nPositional negotiation is often adversarial or competitive in style approach. Positional negotiators focus on the distribution of outcomes, i.e. a zero/sum or win/lose outcome is likely. Such negotiators are not interested in meeting the needs of others; their gain is at the expense of the other negotiator. In other words the outcome should include the best possible gain for them and is more about who gets the biggest share of the pie (based on the assumption of fnite resources or the fxed pie theory). Positional negotiators style approach is competitive, assertive even aggressive. \nPositional negotiation can refer to a situation where both parties to the negotiation \npropose to reach a settlement on purely fnancial grounds and do not wish to continue any relationship with each other. Because of these factors it can tend to be a more con -\nfrontational form of negotiation. \nPrincipled negotiation \nPrincipled negotiation is often described as collaborative, integrative, problem-solving or interest-based bargaining. Principled negotiators focus on the interests of each party and a distribution of the fxed resources. The principled or collaborative approach will take \n2 F isher R and Ury W, Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In (Penguin, London, 1983), \n16–94. \n\n--- Page 424 ---\n  \n   \n   \n  \n   NEGOTIATION 393 \n1.

Post-nego\u0015a\u0015on cri\u0015cal\n review \nFigure 14.1 The three stages of negotiation \ninto account the other bargainer’s interests. The assumption here is that there is no fxed \npie, and it is a win/win approach or a non-zero/sum game.3 \nPrincipled negotiation can refer to a situation where both parties not only wish a set -\ntlement of the current dispute (which may be seen in fnancial terms), but they also wish, or need, to continue their relationship. This form of negotiation requires a particular approach since the most amicable solution preserving the relationship may not consti -\ntute the best fnancial solution (if money is involved) for one of the parties or even both. However, often in these cases the continuance of the relationship is more important than fnancial issues. By the nature of its aims, principled negotiation tends to be more interac -\ntive and fexible in terms of outcome. \nTHE PROCESS OF A NEGOTIATION \nYou will not be surprised to learn that negotiation is a process. It begins before you and your team enter the room to negotiate and continues afterwards. To help you understand this, it might be helpful to view the negotiation process as a three-stage activity involving: \n(1) pre-negotiation planning; \n(2) in-negotiation strategy; \n(3) post-negotiation critical/refective review. \nThis is demonstrated in Figure 14 .1. \nAs you can see, the greater part of the work takes place before the negotiation. Pre -\nplanning and effective preparation are key to any successful negotiation. \nThere are several ways in which a negotiation can be set up for you by your lectur -\ners, and a variety of ‘paper trails’ may be constructed for you. You may be given the time and opportunity to interview a fellow student role playing a live ‘client’, and here your job will be to extract the details of the dispute and your client’s desired outcome for the negotiation. Or you may be given a written set of client instructions to work from. These written instructions should be relatively comprehensive, giving you all the information you require in order to look into the dispute. They may or may not be supplemented by other \n3 T his approach includes the four theoretical principles expounded by Fisher and Ury mentioned earlier. \n\n--- Page 425 ---\n \n  394 NEGOTIATION  \nconstructed documentation such as letters sent to your client or written by them, copies \nof any relevant contracts or copies of emails and fle notes to and from your client. \nGUIDED NARRATIVE ON THE STAGES IN A NEGOTIATION \nThe next pages will take you briefy through the steps in a typical team negotiation. As with other skills there is no shortage of good guidance available. If you are  to engage in \nnegotiation you will be guided through your exercise by your tutor. Seen from a macro-level, the key steps for a team negotiation are shown in Figure 14 .2. \n2. Individual team \n1.

However, \nthat does not mean you should not take responsibility for acquiring a general understand -\ning of the area. The negotiation as an exercise, whether assessed or non-assessed, will succeed or fail on the basis of: \n  each individual team member’s independent management of the task; \n  the overall team management of the task. \nFirst meeting with your team and becoming familiar with the client instructions \nThere are usually just two or three students to a team, and you may not know each other \nbefore the task. It is a good idea to meet briefy right at the start, so that introductions can be made. You should then arrange a time to meet to discuss the negotiation, once each of you has had the time to consider: \n  your client’s written instructions, determining the area(s) of law involved and the \npotential issues raised; \n  your client’s instructions concerning the settlement they would fnd acceptable, and their willingness to compromise and if so their leeway for compromise. \nGiving each team member proper time to consider the client instructions will avoid jump -\ning to conclusions. It is important that each team member comes to their own view without being initially led by anyone else. This ensures that several minds have reviewed the instruc -\ntions. If there are uncertainties in the team, a debate can begin about relevant issues. \nThere is no reason why you cannot in your frst brief meeting agree that you will meet one \nor two hours later. The important issue is not to rush these important preliminary stages. \nSecond meeting with the team and allocation of tasks \nA good discussion should take place concerning the areas of law thought to be involved, the nature of the dispute and the client’s desired settlement. Ideally your team should reach a preliminary view as to the areas of law involved and then you can all decide how you will split the initial research between you. You all need to agree on a timescale within which this initial research will be concluded. This will be determined by the date of the actual negotiation or times given to you by your lecturer. You can then work on: \n  researching the area of law that is relevant to your part of your client’s legal dispute. \nThe best place to start is a textbook to get an overview of the area. You can then look at primary legal sources as relevant. Follow any advice from your lecturer on this matter; \n\n--- Page 427 ---\n \n 396 NEGOTIATION  \n  re-considering the facts of the dispute as set out by your client in light of your \nresearch and understanding of the general area of law; \n  considering, if you can at this point, the likely success of your client if the matter were to go to court, given your understanding of the law and the dispute. \nThird team meeting and decisions concerning application of law, \nnegotiating strategies and division of tasks in-negotiation \nAt the third team meeting you should: \n  Pool your research and discuss the likely success of your client, given your under -\nstanding of the law and the dispute, if the matter were to go to court. This information \nlets you know how advantageous it is for your client to settle. It also lets you know the likely response of the other side to your attempts to settle. \n  Consider your client’s directions concerning their desires in relation to settlement. Is it solely a fnancial issue or are there other matters relating to relationships? Effectively, is this a positional or a principled negotiation? \n  Consider any incentives you can offer, such as continuing business relationships. \n  Draw up a plan or agenda for introducing issues during the negotiation. Decide which questions to ask, in which order and determine your best and worst acceptable out -\ncome. Make a plan as to what to do if one of the team ‘freezes’ or begins to discuss a matter out of turn. Is there a leader who will interject? \n  Decide who is responsible for ensuring that at the end of the negotiation there is a clear note of the settlement (if there is one) or the next action to take (if there is no set -\ntlement). If there is a settlement, your note of it should be compared to the other side’s version. Make clear that any settlement has to be fnally agreed upon by your client. \n  Ensure you have a proper strategy for good post-negotiation critical refection. \nAs you discuss all of the matters above, you will agree as a team what further meetings may be required and what written notes have to be made and circulated. \nIn-negotiation strategy \nThe negotiation itself is a dynamic event. You cannot control everything and you do not know if the other team is going to be competent, effcient or professional and what nego -\ntiation style they will adopt. You do not necessarily know what it is that they are going to say or what their plan is, but your team should have thought about their likely strategies and plan. It is a good idea therefore to bring an agenda to the negotiating table and com -\npare the agenda points with those proposed by the other negotiating team (if they have an agenda). Agreeing on an agenda can then help to structure the negotiation. What you do know is your team strategy, where you ft within it and what your job is. Keep to this strategy and your job. Do not jettison it in a panic: you could place your team in jeopardy in the middle of the negotiation. \n\n--- Page 428 ---\n  \n \n  \n \n \n    \n  NEGOTIATION 397 \nAs a team you need to respond to the other team as required. This could mean tak -\ning control of the negotiation at appropriate points to ensure your strategy is worked out \nwhen it is needed. You may also need to change your strategy in response to the other team’s behaviour and strategy. \nAt the micro-level you also need to consider the language that each of you uses. It \nmust be appropriate, formal, professional and not peppered with legal terms. \nWhen you turn to the actual negotiation itself, no matter how much time you have given \nto planning you will be surprised by the speed with which your allotted time passes. You need to have a clear view of the micro-dynamics of the negotiation and the processes it moves through to ensure you reach your goals. These are set out in Figure 14 .3. \n2. Agree basic1.

In other words, at \nthe outset of the negotiation, see if you can agree to use one document that both parties \ncan contribute to a set of agreed points that emerge from the ongoing negotiation pro -\ncess. This will ensure that both negotiating teams have the same set of notes/points and this will undoubtedly help to frame the agreement. \nAt the conclusion of the negotiation, the agreed points from the one text document \ncan be written up in a coherent format in order to refect the agreement which has been reached. The chapter on drafting (see Chapter 16 ) should give you some useful guidance \non how to draft a document so as to clearly evidence the terms and details of the agree -\nment reached following your team negotiation. \nPost-negotiation critical review \nReviewing the negotiation after it has taken place is an important learning tool. Indeed, critical refection on any learning task is important as it allows you to achieve your full learning potential. Even if you felt the task went well, discussing the negotiation together as a team can help to tease out real problems and mistakes. You should take time to note which issues were the fault of the other team and which were down to you. However, mistakes by the other team might have caused you or your team to lose confdence. So it is important to discuss all of the issues. Many assessed negotiations will require you to refect on your performance and for the team to submit a post-negotiation review. \nAgenda for post-negotiation refective review \nWhen refecting upon the negotiation you have been involved in, it can be useful to have an agenda to discuss the different aspects of the negotiation. The agenda could include: \nTeam-working issues \n  Was a sensible timescale set up and implemented at the team level? \n  Did anyone fail to meet their obligations and cause a problem for the team? Could this have been avoided? \n  Was there a good set of in-team interpersonal relationships for the task? \n  Is there anything that could be done differently next time? \n  Was there any team mismanagement of the task in terms of timing, preparation or in the negotiation itself? If so, was this inevitable? \n  Is there anything that could be done differently next time? \nIndividual issues \n  Did you effciently manage your own time? \n  Do you consider that you put in adequate time and energy to the team? \n  How did you respond in the team? \n\n--- Page 430 ---\n  \n \n \n   NEGOTIATION 399 \nThe appropriateness of the negotiation strategy – pre-planning \n  Did the team follow the pre-planned strategy? If not, why not? \n  Was the pre-planned strategy extensive enough? \n  Did the team allow themselves enough pre-agreed fexibility? \n  Did the team set suffcient ‘best’ and ‘worst’ case agreed settlements? \n  Did the team set boundaries where they would not settle? \n  Did anything unexpected occur? If so, how successfully did the team deal with it? \n  What would you and/or the team do differently next time regarding a strategy? \nThe negotiation outcome \n  How successful was the outcome – was it the one you had planned for? \n  If you did not want that outcome as a team, is there anything that you or the team \ncould have done differently to avoid it? \n  Was the outcome you achieved the best that you could have got in the circumstances? \nProper attention to the completion of the post-negotiation review enables you to achieve a greater level of critical awareness of the process of negotiation. This will assist the con -\ntinual development of your skills of negotiation. \nCONCLUSION \nNegotiation is a creative activity that provides you with the opportunity to work with a range of skills to refne your understanding of law. It refnes your communication skills and team-working skills and continues to develop your argument construction skills. Not unlike many practical activities which you will encounter as part of your legal education, preparation is key. So, your success in negotiation also depends on your research and analysis skills and the ability to read the instructions in a focused manner, enabling you to work towards the best settlement achievable. Negotiation encourages a sophisticated understanding of the relationship between facts of a dispute, applicable law, and client expectations. \nNegotiation exercises are increasingly being used within the context of the academic \nstage of training because of their great value in allowing students to work within such broad skill sets. If you are able to engage in such exercises, you will fnd that your under -\nstanding of these skills, your ability to handle legal rules and your ability to manage facts will be considerably enhanced. Since these skills are transferable, you will also be enhancing your understanding of other law subjects. You could even consider entering the national negotiation competition open to law students and organised by the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR).\n4 \n4 T his centre also trains practitioners in the areas of mediation and negotiation and it hosts an excellent \nwebsite: https://www.cedr.com/. \n\n--- Page 431 ---\n 400 NEGOTIATION  \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  Along with mediation, negotiation is a major form of alternative dispute resolution. \n  Legal advisors, or other qualifed negotiators, negotiate on behalf of their clients in \naccordance with their client’s instructions, to reach a settlement of a legal dispute without the use of litigation strategies. \n  At the academic stage of legal education an assessed or formative negotiation is conducted as a role play between two teams, who act as legal advisors for the respective clients in a fctitious legal dispute. \n  Negotiation exercises test a number of skills sets from research, legal argument, independent study, management of documents through to oral skills, communica -\ntion skills and teamwork. \n  Engagement with the process of negotiation encourages a sophisticated under -\nstanding of the relationship between facts of a dispute, applicable law, and client expectations. \n  Negotiation exercises are increasingly being used within the context of the academic stage of training because of their great value in allowing students to work within such broad skill sets. \n  Negotiation involves identifcation of issues (in common/which differ), needs and interests and options for agreement. \n  There are two main forms of negotiation: positional and principled. \n  Positional negotiation refers to a situation where both parties often wish for a settle -\nment on purely fnancial grounds and probably do not wish to continue any relation -\nship with each other. \n  Principled negotiation refers to a situation where both parties not only wish a settle -\nment of the current dispute but they often wish, or need, to continue their relationship. \n  Negotiation is a process requiring careful pre-negotiation planning, in-negotiation strategies and post-negotiation review. \n\n--- Page 432 ---\n15 \n  \n MEDIATION \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Appreciate the role of mediation in helping to resolve a wide range of disputes. \n  Understand the structural process of mediation and its common phases as applica -\nble to civil/commercial disputes. \n  Gain an understanding of some of the specifc core skills commonly used in mediation. \n  Further consolidate some of the skills you have already acquired and apply them to \na different context. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-19  \n\n--- Page 433 ---\n 402 MEDIATION  \nINTRODUCTION \nContinuing the theme of communication skills acquisition, the study of mediation is argu -\nably an important way of introducing students to a dispute resolution process that has \nbecome more popular in the UK. Mediation is a process that will enable you to appreciate the importance of communication and in some cases perhaps give you an opportunity to acquire core mediator skills to enable you to engage in peer mediation or even go on to further your practical skills competency through training with, for example, a community mediation service. In order to embed your skills there are also national and international student mediation competitions which are available for you to participate in. \nTaking a broad approach to the teaching of dispute resolution provides a more accu -\nrate representation of the approaches taken in many common law jurisdictions. Through reading this chapter you will gain a sound understanding of the role of mediation within the dispute resolution continuum, develop an awareness of mediation principles and learn how to acquire some of the skills involved in both acting as a mediator and advising as a lawyer. \nFor parties who choose mediation as their dispute resolution process for the frst time, \nit is helpful for them to understand that negotiation forms the basis of the mediation process. In the previous chapter you were introduced to the concept of negotiation and will therefore have a sound platform upon which to build an understanding of mediation. The added dimension which affects the dynamic of a negotiation and transforms it into mediation is the introduction of a third party neutral called a mediator. \nAs well as bringing natural attributes to mediation, a good mediator will need to learn \ncertain skills in order to facilitate the mediation process effectively. There are differing views on how interventionist a mediator should be, and theorists tend to agree that there are two broad mediator style approaches: facilitative and evaluative. Whatever approach is favoured by the mediator, effective communication skills are required. \nWHAT IS MEDIATION? \nSimply put, mediation is facilitated negotiation. It is a voluntary process conducted con -\nfdentially whereby the parties to a dispute are empowered to resolve their differences in a structured yet informal environment with the assistance of an impartial facilitator: the mediator. \nThe foundational principles of mediation \nIt is important to remember that mediation is a wholly voluntary process; the parties must want to try mediation as an appropriate means to resolving their dispute rather than com -\nmencing or continuing litigation. \n\n--- Page 434 ---\n  \n  MEDIATION 403 \nNego˙a˙on----Media˙on-----Arbitra˙on------Li˙ga˙on \nCONSENSUAL ADJUDICATIV E \nFigure 15.1 The dispute resolution continuum \nThe mediation process is also confdential. The parties sign an agreement at the com -\nmencement of the mediation to be bound by confdentiality. Essentially, this means that \nthe parties agree not to repeat anything discussed during the course of the mediation. Similarly, the process is accepted by the parties as being without prejudice, implying that if the dispute does not settle following the mediation and litigation commences or resumes, neither party can use any confdential information disclosed during the course of the mediation in subsequent court proceedings. \nThe mediation process is facilitated by an impartial third party mediator, which brings \na completely different dynamic to the negotiations which may have been conducted hith -\nerto and which are more often than not bilateral. The mediator’s task is not to take sides or pass judgment. In one sense mediation can be described as facilitated negotiation; the mediator assists the parties in fnding a mutually acceptable solution to the dispute, which may well have reached a position of stalemate. \nThe parties have full control over the process and the outcome; they can bring the \nmediation to a close at any time, and with the assistance of the mediator can explore a whole range of settlement options that are unavailable to a judge. All decision-making rests with the parties and as such the process is both fexible and empowering. \nDispute resolution strategies can be viewed as being on a continuum ranging from \n‘consensual’ (the most fexible forms of dispute resolution giving most power to the par -\nties) to the adjudicative (the least fexible forms of dispute resolution with the least power in the hands of the parties). This continuum is set out in Figure 15 .1. \nThe further one moves towards the right hand side of the dispute resolution continuum \nthe parties begin to lose control of their dispute. As a process, negotiation offers the most fexibility in terms of timing, forum and decision-making, whereas litigation offers the least fexible process for decision-making; it is formalised, governed by rules and the decision-making lies with a judge and is therefore out of the control of the parties. Mediation offers a similar level of process fexibility as negotiation; whilst facilitated by a third party, the parties have full control over the decision-making and it hence has a strongly consensual element associated with it. \nTHE MEDIATION PROCESS \nThe mediation process structure can vary depending on the type or subject matter of the dispute. Whether it be a commercial, community, workplace or family dispute the under -\nlying mediation principles are generally the same and whatever the mediation forum, the mediator will use the same set of core skills. For the purposes of this book the civil and commercial mediation procedure is used. \n\n--- Page 435 ---\n \n \n \n       \n \n     404 MEDIATION  \nPHASE 1 PHASE 2 Opening Explora\u0012on \nThe four \nphases of the \nmedia\u0012on \nprocess PHASE 3Prepara\u0014on \nBargaining \nPHASE 4 Se˛lement Concluding \nFigure 15.2 Common civil/commercial mediation phases \nThe mediator will be chosen during the preparatory stage of the process. The type \nof mediator and their style can be important to the parties and their lawyers. Two broad \nmediator styles have been identifed: evaluative and facilitative.1 The evaluative media -\ntor will be inclined to adopt a far more searching and probing style, often bringing their knowledge of the dispute area to the mediation; these mediators may be former judges, practising lawyers or come from a professional background with expertise relevant to the subject matter of the dispute. The facilitative mediator will be rather more inclined to let the parties work things out for themselves and assist, coach or guide them rather than evaluate the parties’ theories, strengths or weaknesses. \nAlthough the mediator will have overall control of the process structure, fexibility is \na key factor and it is this principle of fexibility that very much sets mediation apart from many other dispute resolution processes. For the purpose of this chapter the model’s application to civil/commercial disputes will be examined. \nThe phases of mediation \nOnce the necessary preparation for the mediation has been undertaken, which includes choice of mediator, the mediation process usually follows the same model progressing through four phases in sequence: from opening, exploration, bargaining through to the concluding phase. This is far from prescriptive, however, but for the purpose of simplifca -\ntion the four-phase structure, demonstrated in Figure 15 .2, will be adopted and explained.\n2 \n1 L Riskin ‘Mediator Orientations, Strategies and Techniques’ (1997) 1 Harvard Negotiation Law Review 7. \n2 T he Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) works to the four phase model; see www.cedr.com/. \n\n--- Page 436 ---\n  MEDIATION 405 \nThe four phases of a typical mediation \nThe next pages will take you briefy through the phases in a typical civil and commercial \nmediation, as shown in Figure 15 .2. \nPhase 1: opening \nOnce the mediator choice has been made, and the parties are happy to proceed with mediation, it will be necessary for the mediator to contact the parties to clarify fnal arrangements such as position statements, an agreed bundle of paginated mediation documents, participant clarifcation, dietary requirements, directions to the venue, etc. Fees (if any) should be dealt with in the pre-mediation agreement, which will also cover important aspects of the mediation process, such as session length and confdentiality. All parties will have received a copy of the ‘agreement to mediate’ in advance. It is also important to ensure that those intending to be present at the mediation include a person from each side who has the authority to make decisions about possible settlement. \nOn the day of the mediation, environment is important and the mediator should have \nan awareness of simple things such as the layout of the building, location of toilet facilities and hospitality provision. Familiarity with all these things helps to set the tone and creates a more relaxed atmosphere. It is vital that the mediator develops empathy from the out -\nset, and your communication skills start here as a mediator. This includes attentive listen -\ning and allowing the parties to be heard without interruption. Those attending mediation for the frst time will often be nervous; they do not know what to expect, and it may be the frst time they have ever (or for some time) been face to face with their opponent. A safe and comfortable environment is therefore essential. \nEach person present will usually at this stage be asked to sign the ‘agreement to medi -\nate’. The mediator (and co-mediator) should then go through introductions and clarify the terms of address. Everyone should be thanked for making the effort to attend. The mediator should then describe what the parties might expect to experience during the course of the mediation and this includes an explanation of the principal aspects of the mediation process, that it is: \n  voluntary; \n  non-binding to the point of agreement; \n  without prejudice; \n  confdential; \n  empowering in the sense that the parties come up with the solution. \nThe mediator should then explain their role and make clear to the parties that they are \nthere to guide the discussion, to clarify the issues, not to judge (there are no rules of evidence), form a view or impose a decision. The mediator may point out to the parties that they may, on occasion, feel it necessary to act as ‘devil’s advocate’ and in so doing \n\n--- Page 437 ---\n \n  406 MEDIATION  \nmay be required to ask some diffcult questions. The mediator must remember to remain \nimpartial throughout. Any ground rules for the mediation can also be agreed upon with the parties at this stage. \nThe parties will then be invited to make a short opening statement. They should be \nreminded by the mediator that these oral statements should be uninterrupted. The parties may then present their understanding of the case. This will be a good opportunity to hear some of the facts and issues which each side believes are important. It can provide an effective summary of the respective parties’ positions and the parties should be encour -\naged to address each other rather than the mediator(s). \nIt should be understood, however, that what are displayed by way of the positions held \nby the parties at the opening session will often only really be the ‘tip of the iceberg’ as far as the real interests behind those positions are concerned. \nThe opening phase should give the parties an opportunity to: \n  learn about the mediation process and understand what is expected of them through engagement with it; \n  set out their positions; \n  listen to the other party’s position. \nPhase 2: exploration \nDuring what is described as the exploration phase of mediation, the mediator should have an opportunity to establish the interests behind the positions held by the respective par -\nties through a series of meetings.\n3 These meetings can be held either jointly or in private. \nIt is well advised to make use of private meetings, sometimes called caucuses, when there is a requirement to tackle sensitive or challenging issues, examine the strengths and weaknesses of a party’s case and establish the parties’ true interests and needs. \nJoint meetings allow all parties to see and hear the information exchange. They can \nalso save time. The mediator has control of the process so will decide what form the meeting should take. \nPrivate meetings with the mediator can generate forward momentum in a mediation. \nThe structure and components of such meetings can vary, however. Most commonly they will take place between the mediator and individually with a party. However, if the parties have lawyers present, there may be merit in meeting with the lawyers for both parties individually without their clients present. Caucuses can take place with the experts who may be present either alone or with the parties and their lawyers in attendance. \nThe extra confdentiality layer attributed to these caucus sessions ensures that the par -\nties can speak freely and openly to the mediator and parties will be generally more pre -\npared to share sensitive information in a confdential caucus setting than in a joint meeting. \nCarefully managed joint meetings can allow all parties to see and hear what is happen -\ning. In these meetings there is often the opportunity for useful information to be traded. \n3 R Fisher and W Ury, Getting to Yes (2nd edition, Penguin, London, 1992), 40, provides a useful expla -\nnation of the relationship between positions and interests illustrated by the library dispute. See also C \nMoore, The Mediation Process: Practical Strategies for Resolving Confict  (4th edition, Jossey-Bass, San \nFrancisco, CA, 2014), ch 12. \n\n--- Page 438 ---\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MEDIATION 407 \nThere is, however, the potential for deadlock through positional behaviour and mediators \nshould think carefully about the timing and reason for calling joint meetings. There is also the danger that the mediator might lose control of the process through, for example, an unexpected event occurring triggered by the parties being in the same space. \nOverall the exploration phase of mediation should provide a really good opportunity for \nthe mediator to build trust with the parties. This trust-building process may then enable the parties to experience emotional release and can encourage them to express them -\nselves openly. If approached skilfully, this phase will yield clarifcation of the real issues, reveal parties’ needs rather than rights, expose hidden agendas and give the mediator the opportunity to ‘reality test’ some of the theories held by the parties. \nThis phase should enable development of potential strategies for settlement and facili -\ntate continued forward momentum towards the next phase of the mediation process. \nThroughout the exploration phase of the mediation, the mediator must remain impar -\ntial and is not seen as being an ally or perceived as being aligned with one party at the expense of another. \nDuring the exploration phase the mediator should be able to encourage the parties to: \n  gain the trust of the parties; \n  focus on interests not positions; \n  examine the issues in detail; \n  determine the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s arguments; \n  share information; \n  shift their positions. \nPhase 3: bargaining \nOnce the parties have shared suffcient information with each other and the mediator and they have accepted that the solution to their problem is not the other party’s prob -\nlem, they may be in a position to move towards the bargaining phase of mediation. In order for effective bargaining to take place the parties should have moved from their original positions. Arriving at this point in the mediation will usually be indicated by the parties’ readiness and willingness to start making and trading offers. At this stage in the mediation the parties will start to negotiate possible terms of settlement. At the heart of any bargaining or negotiation process is a desire to achieve some kind of gain. You will have learnt that we negotiate in order to obtain something we cannot get for ourselves. Allied to this, however, may also be a desire to preserve a relationship. As we have seen in the previous chapter on negotiation, interests are the fundamental drivers of any negotiation, and these are often distinct from the positions displayed by parties to mediation during the opening joint meeting. The interests underpinning them will have been explored and revealed in the exploration phase; it is then perhaps a measure of success in mediation as to how well a party’s interests are met through effective bargaining. \n\n--- Page 439 ---\n          \n \n \n \n 408 MEDIATION  \nThere are no hard and fast rules as to how to move the bargaining forward from the \nexploration phase. It is at this stage that mediation can truly be described as facilitated negotiation. The mediator should, through intuition and by observing the unfolding dynamics of the mediation, be able to assess the situation and then respond appropri -\nately to help the parties engage in effective bargaining. Fundamentally, however, the par -\nties must have gained suffcient information up to that point in the mediation to enable the process to move through the next phase. \nAs well as helping the parties to select the alternative that seems best, the mediator’s \nrole during the bargaining phase may also involve providing encouragement on how bar -\ngaining might best be progressed. A good mediator can do this by: \n  being creative; \n  signifcantly infuencing the negotiations; \n  acting as a facilitator; \n  taking offers and counter offers between the parties’ rooms. \nThroughout this phase the mediator should be carefully observing the effectiveness of the \ninter-party negotiations and at the same time be reminded of the importance of mediator impartiality. In turn the mediator should remind the parties that they must be responsible for owning the problem and the solution throughout. \nWith the mediator’s help, the bargaining phase should give the parties an opportunity to: \n  start trading offers; \n  create rather than claim value; \n  explore options for settlement; \n  choose the more favourable options; \n  think about tailoring an agreement to suit all parties’ needs. \nPhase 4: concluding \nWith any dispute which arrives at mediation the overall goal is to meet the parties’ inter -\nests. Perhaps therefore the measure of a satisfactory to good mediation outcome is how well these interests are met. A better outcome than one found elsewhere, i.e. than per -\nhaps the best alternative to a negotiated agreement (or BATNA)\n4 should include a creative \nsolution that captures as much available value for each party as possible. It should be a legitimate solution so that none of the parties feels that they have been taken advantage of. \nThere must be a frm implementable and sustainable commitment, and perhaps an agree -\nment that helps build the kind of relationship the parties want with each other in the future. \nAny mediation settlement agreement must: \n  be clear and not open to misinterpretation; \n  be reached to the satisfaction of the parties and in that sense it will be self-determinate; \n4 T he idea of the BATNA was introduced by R Fisher and Ury (n 3), 97. \n\n--- Page 440 ---\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            MEDIATION 409 \n  as much as possible, deal with all aspects of the dispute; \n  be capable of being implemented and therefore must be workable and sustainable. \nIf these considerations are taken into account the mediation outcome should produce an agreement that avoids the need for further dispute. \nThe mediator’s role during the concluding phase of the mediation is to ensure that the \naspects mentioned above are brought about. Mediation is not concerned with achieving a settlement at all costs and the mediator should not be driven by the need for a successful outcome; remember this is the parties’ dispute. Whilst every effort should be made to reach an agreement that covers all aspects of the dispute, sometimes not all issues can be dealt with, and it may be that any outstanding issues can be the subject of ongoing negotiation. Research suggests that parties who take ownership of the problem and feel responsible for coming to their own resolution are more likely to honour the commitments they make. \nThroughout the mediation and particularly during the concluding phase, the media -\ntor should remain positive and encourage settlement opportunities wherever possible. This will inevitably involve the mediator liaising with the parties and helping them to draft the terms of the settlement agreement once they have reached terms. If the parties are represented, then their lawyers can usually take responsibility for drafting the settlement agreement, which can then be checked by the mediator once written up. \nOf importance for the mediator is to ensure that there are no unforeseen obstacles \nregarding implementation of the settlement agreement; for instance, are there deadlines, should there be a timetable and what happens in the event of default? When encouraging the parties towards settlement the mediator should be able to make use of some well-chosen active intervention techniques, which will include the use of careful questioning about realistic options, on occasion playing ‘devil’s advocate’ and providing helpful infor -\nmation so as to facilitate forward momentum. \nAs already mentioned, mediators should be in control of the process and it is this \n‘process-control’ that can be a useful source of power when encouraging parties to move towards settlement. If properly in control of the mediation, the mediator can affect the perceptions, attitudes and behaviour of others present at the mediation. \nThe source of this mediator power may include associational status; some parties \nmay be drawn to a mediator who is a lawyer or a former judge, for instance. Mediators who have particular expertise in the feld or area of the subject matter of the dispute may gain the trust and confdence of the parties and command respect. Intuitive or personal attributes should not be underestimated, and included in these natural skills is an ability to transmit messages in the right way or to use moral pressure without of course using duress or undue infuence. \nWhen a settlement has been reached the agreement should usually be evidenced in \nwriting and signed by the parties. It should include: \n  clarity of language, specifcity, heads of agreement; \n  reference to confdentiality; \n\n--- Page 441 ---\n \n \n \n 410 MEDIATION  \n  confrmation of the future dispute resolution process to be used in the event of the \nagreement breaking down; \n  overall the agreement should be workable and one that the parties can live with. \nGuidance on how to draft a standard mediation settlement agreement is provided in Chapter 16. \nMEDIATION SKILLS \nAn understanding of the mediation process and its place within the dispute resolution pano -\nrama is necessary before the skills a mediator requires can be acquired. Parties who decide to choose mediation as a process to attempt to fnd a resolution to their dispute may do so because they might have failed in their attempts to reach an agreement through negotiation. \nFailed negotiations sometimes occur because communication has broken down; this \nmay perhaps be due to the fact that the parties have become too entrenched or posi -\ntional. Among other things, barriers to effective negotiation can be explained as being psychological, cognitive or even cultural. \nBecause much of mediation is about effective communication, without active par -\nticipation in a process of communication, parties in dispute who choose to engage in mediation must be prepared to disclose information to the mediator and exchange infor -\nmation with their opponent. Without this facilitated communication information exchange, progress will not be made towards the possibility of a consensual voluntary agreement. \nThe skills you bring to mediation \nMany of the skills that a mediator requires are centred around aspects of communication. We all have the ability to communicate; mediators have to be effective communicators and it is essential that they have a good command of language. Mediators should be prepared to encourage mediation participants to communicate in a positive way so as to develop forward momentum. The range of skills that a mediator is required to develop are set out in Figure 15 .3. \nWe will consider the skills of Positivity, Questioning and Listening located in the com -\nmunication skills set [B] in Figure 15 .3. In relation to the skills of questioning and listening \nwe will also consider their respective associated sub-skills of reality testing, brainstorm -\ning and reframing. They will be set out with their numbered headings enabling you to link them back to  Figure 15 .3. \nPositivity: [B] 2 \nMediators should whenever possible use positive language. They should encourage the parties to maintain a positive focus throughout the process, and their role in using such positive language can be compared to coaching. \n\n--- Page 442 ---\n   \n  \n  MEDIATION 411 The Range\nMediator Skills \n[A]\nOrganisa˜onal\n1.\nProcess\nManagement [B]\nCommunica˜on \n1.\nTone 2.\nPosi˜vity \n(a)\nNon-verbal\n(Body Language) (b)\nVerbal 3.\nQues˜oning \n(a)\nReality Tes˜ng (b)\nBrainstorming 4.\nListening\n(a)\nReframing [C]\nPersonal Skill s \n1.\nPa˜ence 2.\nEmpathy \nFigure 15.3 Mediator skills \n\n--- Page 443 ---\n412 MEDIATION  \nThis positivity includes having the parties focus on interests and the underlying needs \nor requirements rather than positions. If relationships are important to the parties, then \nthey should be reminded that mediation is a future-focused process and any mediation settlement agreement should take account of how the parties would like the future to look as far as their relationship with each other is concerned. During the bargaining phase, for instance, the positive focus can be employed by turning demands into options. \nNon-verbal gestures: [B] 2 (a) \nNon-verbal gestures can communicate information and when used can convey both pos -\nitive and negative intent. Mediators should beware of cultural implications, however, and should be wise to have some familiarity with the cultural norms of those attending media -\ntion. Mediators can manage the use of gestures by using verbal requests, by separating the parties and caucusing or through transmitting indirect signals. The use of silence can on occasion be helpful and through its judicious use the mediator can dictate the pace of the mediation discourse and give non-verbal signals. Silence can provide time for either the mediator or a party to think before speaking. It can also demonstrate interest and/or respect. \nQuestioning: [B] 3 \nEffective communication skills are required during the exploration phase and particularly during the caucus sessions. The choice of questions is important in order to maintain dialogue and draw out information during these sessions. Often the use of open-ended questioning will enable a party to share information with the mediator, for example: ‘what did you think of the other party’s opening statement?’ That kind of question will prompt an open response from the party and may provide the mediator with some useful informa -\ntion which can then lead to a deeper exploration of some of the issues. An open ques -\ntioning strategy can then be followed by closed questions when specifc information is required, for example, ‘so you feel hurt by X’s behaviour ’. \nUnlike a court room there are no strict rules of evidence associated with mediation. \nAs such, leading questions are permitted, for example: ‘ so after going to the supermarket \nand buying the goods, you then took the tin of beans without paying for them didn’t you? ’ \nAt the end of a caucus session it might be sensible, or indeed necessary, for the medi -\nator to provide the party with a task. This might be as simple as asking the party to look at the claim more carefully and provide more accurate fgures. It might even involve request -\ning a party to think more carefully about what areas of the claim, after more detailed scrutiny, might be dropped or discontinued. It could even involve a request for a party to make a telephone call to obtain information from a third party. \nIt is also helpful at the conclusion of a caucus session with a party for the mediator to \nsummarise the main points revealed. This also helps to build trust and confdence in the mediator. \n\n--- Page 444 ---\n  MEDIATION 413 \nReality testing: [B] 3 (a) \nOne useful skill which mediators can use to positive effect is the idea of reality testing. \nMany parties who arrive at mediation have often not really examined the strengths of their case. This may be due to the lack of information or because they have not taken an objec -\ntive view of the dispute. In testing the theories held by parties in relation to the strengths of their case, the mediator can use certain techniques to encourage this, such as playing ‘devil’s advocate’. \nOne of the most diffcult things to achieve for a mediator is to encourage parties to try \nto see the dispute from their opponent’s perspective. If that can be achieved, then this can sometimes help to move the parties from entrenched positions. This does take skill and a certain amount of ‘persuasion’ on the part of the mediator. In no way must these kind of techniques be used to place pressure on a party or even hold them to ransom; such approaches would be in breach of the mediator’s ethical code. \nBrainstorming/option seeking: [B] 3 (b) \nDuring the bargaining stage a number of different tactics can be used by the mediator to encourage the parties to search for settlement options. These may be utilised either in caucus or in joint session. With a view to making settlement easier to reach, brainstorm -\ning is a technique that can be of great assistance. The idea of brainstorming is to encour -\nage the parties to look at the problem from different angles and reinforce those common interests already identifed during exploration. \nThe parties will be required to think of alternative settlement options of differing \nstrengths and appeal; the mediator may ask them for their preferences, perhaps invent a list of options to take if no agreement can be reached and then improve some of the more promising ideas and thus convert them into practical alternatives. \nListening skills: [B] 4 \nAs a mediator it is essential to have good listening skills. Through attentive listening, a mediator will be able to: \n  decode a verbal message; \n  identify the emotion being expressed; \n  be selective about words or phrases heard; \n  be prepared to restate the ‘feeling’ content of the message accurately for affrmation, \nconfrmation and clarifcation. \nMediators should also be prepared to use active or refective listening techniques, such as nodding or smiling, when a party requires affrmation and throughout the exchange the mediator should maintain good eye contact with the party to whom they are listening. \n\n--- Page 445 ---\n \n   \n \n 414 MEDIATION  \nNon-verbal gestures can communicate information. They can be both positive and \nnegative. Mediators can manage the use of gestures by verbal requests, separation (cau -\ncuses) and indirect signals transmitted by the mediator. Beware of cultural implications, \nhowever, and in this regard mediators should be sensitive to cultural norms. \nGood listening skills are essential as a mediator must be sure that they have heard \nexactly what the party who is talking has said. They must then be prepared to accurately verify what they have heard; in so doing the mediator must be able to additionally display personal skills of empathy and be able to demonstrate acceptance and acknowledge -\nment of any emotions displayed by the speaker. This will then in turn allow the competent mediator to explore the reason for those emotions and uncover the underlying issues. Showing empathy can enable the parties to release tension through expression of emo -\ntion; it also gives the mediator an opportunity to manage the process through recognition of emotions by making appropriate responses. \nReframing: [B] 4 (a) \nMediators also use other techniques borrowed from therapeutic approaches, such as active or productive reframing.\n5 Reframing can be used to change the verbal presentation \nof an idea, concern, proposal or question;6 for example, if a party says that ‘Ever since my \nboss caused this problem I have been unable to concentrate at work’ the mediator could actively refect the content of that narrative by saying; ‘so the problem you mention has really been affecting your work performance’. \nNot only does this show to the party who has disclosed this information that they \nhave been listened to by the mediator, but it can neutralise the language used by the party. In other words ‘drawing the sting’, so as to make the meaning of words appear less harsh or confrontational. The mediator intervening in such a way to modify language can help change a party’s perceptions and behaviour and positive reframing techniques can sometimes achieve this. \nLanguage variation or modifcation can: \n  present claims in a different way; \n  sometimes create a more a positive spin; \n  de-personalise it. \nConsider this phrase: ‘I’m not going to agree to anything that deprives me of seeing my kids!’ The mediator could reframe this statement by saying, ‘so maintaining regular con -\ntact with your children is something that is important to you’. \nIt is undoubtedly much easier to reframe positions, interests and issues than it is to \nreframe values, moral codes or beliefs all of which can defne a person.\n7 However, dur -\n5 S ee H Brown and A Marriott ADR Principles and Practice (4th edition, Thomson/Sweet & Maxwell, London, \n2018), 139 and Boulle & Nesic Mediator Skills and Techniques: Triangle of Infuence (Bloomsbury, London, \n2010), 151, who liken reframing to active listening.

Answers can be found at the end of the chapter. \nActivity 15.1: reframing exercise \n(a) Harsh ‘confict’ words and phrases can be softened in order to remove the \n‘sting’ which they might convey. This is called reframing. Reframe these words and phrases so as to soften their meaning: \n Dispute/Confict \n Claims/Demands: \n Opponent/Defendant: \n Concede and compromise \n It’s a matter of principal/It is fundamental to the claim \n You’re a liar/I don’t believe you \n(b) Harsh statements – reframe these sentences so as to soften their meaning: \n‘The builder’s a cowboy; he completely bodged the job’. ‘The work done on my car has cost me a lot of money and it’s useless to drive’. ‘She’s never going to see the kids again if she doesn’t stop screwing money out of me’. ‘The guy’s an idiot, he’s ignoring me and that’s just plain rude; he just won’t return \nmy calls and refuses to speak to me to discuss the problem’. \n‘If he doesn’t repair the car in one week I’m suing him’. \nCONCLUSION \nMediation is a process-orientated method of alternative dispute resolution within the wider dispute resolution continuum. Although it is a fexible dispute resolution process, it relies on certain core principles and, in the context of a civil/commercial type dispute, the mediator facilitating the mediation through a series of defned phases. \nAs with other areas of dispute resolution, mediation requires the application of spe -\ncifc skills. Some may already be possessed by the mediator and others can be acquired through learning. \nThroughout the mediation process mediators should always: \n  endeavour to be empathetic and patient; \n  uphold the important ethical mediation principles such as impartiality (which includes being non-biased and non-aligned); \n\n--- Page 447 ---\n416 MEDIATION  \n  remember to respect confdentiality. \nAn awareness of parties’ emotions and their culture is important and mediators should \nwherever possible resist making assumptions or holding prejudices. Overall, a good understanding of the mediation process structure is required in order to maintain effec -\ntive process management. \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  Mediation is a voluntary process conducted confdentially, which empowers the par -\nties in dispute to resolve their differences with the assistance of an impartial facilita -\ntor: the mediator. \n  The various dispute resolution strategies of negotiation, mediation, arbitration and litigation can be viewed as being on a continuum ranging from ‘consensual’ (the most fexible forms of dispute resolution giving most power to the parties) to the ‘adjudica -\ntive’ (the least fexible forms of dispute resolution with least power in the hands of the parties). \n  Mediation offers a high level of fexibility in that although it is facilitated by a third party, the parties retain full control over the decision-making process leading to set -\ntlement. Therefore it has a strongly consensual element associated with it. \n  The mediation process structure varies according to the type and subject of the dis -\npute, but its underlying principles remain more or less the same. \n  The choice of mediator is important as the mediator and their preferred style deter -\nmine the contours of the mediation. \n  Two broad mediator styles have been identifed: evaluative and facilitative. \n  The evaluative mediator (who is often an expert in the area or has legal expertise) adopts a more searching and probing style. \n  The facilitative mediator tends to allow the parties to work things out for themselves and will assist, coach or guide them when required. \n  It is possible to identify a basic four-phase structure to most civil/commercial media -\ntion involving opening, exploration, bargaining and conclusion. \n  Mediators are required to develop an extensive range of skills circulating around organisational skills, communication skills and personal skills. \n  Communication skills are key and include the ability to remain positive, engage in effective listening and reframing, and develop good questioning skills. Mediators need to be able to draw out the parties into active engagement with the dispute resolution process. \n\n--- Page 448 ---\n  \n  \n  MEDIATION 417 \nActivity 15.1: suggested answers \n(a) Harsh ‘confict’ words and phrases can be softened in order to remove the ‘sting’ \nwhich they might convey. This is called reframing. The suggested reframed \nwords and phrases are in italics:  Dispute/confict – disagreement or difference in opinion \n Claims/demands – needs and requirements \n Opponent/defendant – the person with whom I have a disagreement \n Concede – compromise \nIt’s a matter of principle/it is fundamental to the claim \nThis is important to me \nYou’re a liar/I don’t believe you I fnd it diffcult believing that this is correct. \n(b) Harsh statements – The suggested reframed sentences are in italics: \n‘The builder’s a cowboy; he completely bodged the job’. \nI’m unhappy with the standard of workmanship. There are areas of the \nbuilder’s work that were substandard. \n‘The work done on my car has cost me a lot of money and it’s useless to drive’. I \nwould like to be compensated for the amount of money I have spent on this car or at least have the repairs done at no charge. \n‘She’s never going to see the kids again if she doesn’t stop screwing money \nout of me’. \nWe need to discuss the child contact arrangements and the level of maintenance \npayments. \n‘The guy’s an idiot, he’s ignoring me and that’s just plain rude; he just won’t \nreturn my calls and refuses to discuss the problem’. \nI’m having diffculty speaking to him; can we try to talk this through so as \nto work out a solution? \n‘If he doesn’t repair the car in one week I’m suing him’. \nI think we need to discuss this before the matter escalates. \nNotice that many of the reframing suggestions include elements of communication or interaction. Finding the time or courage to talk about a problem that is dete-riorating can start a dialogue process which may ultimately lead to an agreement. The alternative is to ignore the situation and let the problem deteriorate further with worsening consequences. \n\n--- Page 450 ---\n16 \n  \n DRAFTING \nLEARNING OUTCOMES \nAfter reading this chapter you should be able to: \n  Appreciate the importance of assimilating facts and applying them in a structured \nway. \n  Understand the importance of language and grammar. \n  Gain an ability to write clearly, concisely and accurately. \n  Further consolidate some of the skills you have already acquired and apply them to a different context. \n  Successfully complete a basic drafting exercise. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-20  \n\n--- Page 451 ---\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 420 DRAFTING  \nINTRODUCTION \nAs a student of law, you will fnd drafting a useful asset whether or not you intend to enter \nthe legal profession. As a lawyer, whether you practice in the area of non-contentious law such as conveyancing (property) or contentious work involving litigation, the need to be able to construct an accurate written document or write a good letter will always arise. Often these transferable skills are acquired as you develop in your place of work. However, the ability to be able to draft effectively will more often than not be required and put into practice much earlier. The requirement to draft a curriculum vitae accompanied by a covering letter for a job application, for instance, is something that students will encounter during compulsory years of schooling. All students will have drafted a per -\nsonal statement to accompany their application for university and will have recognised the importance of ‘getting it right’, often within a limited word count. \nWHAT IS DRAFTING? \nFor students of law, a drafting exercise will sometimes be used as a method of assess -\nment in order to display knowledge and understanding of a particular topic. You may, for instance, be required to draft a particular document so as to evidence the details of the agreement reached following a negotiation. It may alternatively be in the form of advice that provides a suggested answer to a legal problem. As we have seen with problem questions in the chapter on ‘Writing answers to legal problem questions’ (see Chapter 11 ), this kind of exercise is designed to test whether you understand a particu -\nlar area of law well and can apply it in a structured way. We have already seen in the chapter on ‘Mediation’ (see Chapter 15 ) that the agreements reached in civil and com -\nmercial type disputes by way of mediation are most commonly evidenced in writing in the form of a mediation settlement agreement. Such mediation settlement agreements will include clarity of language, specifcity and heads of agreement and which overall must be an agreement that can be implemented and is workable for the parties. An example of a mediation settlement agreement appears towards the end of this chapter (Figure 16 .4). \nRange of skills required for drafting \nAs a student of law, drafting requires you to integrate a range of skills that you may or may not already possess, including: \n  General writing skills. \n  An attention to detail. \n  Accuracy. \n\n--- Page 452 ---\n  \n  DRAFTING 421 \nFigure 16.1 Letter of Claim (workplace accident) \n\n--- Page 453 ---\n  422 DRAFTING  \nFigure 16.2 Screenshot of a precedent for Particulars of Claim (private nuisance) \n\n--- Page 454 ---\n  \n  DRAFTING 423 \nFigure 16.2 Continued \n\n--- Page 455 ---\n  424 DRAFTING  \nFigure 16.3 Screenshot of the frst page of a completed N1 Claim Form (personal injury claim)  \n\n--- Page 456 ---\n  \n  DRAFTING 425 \nFigure 16.4 Screenshot of a Mediation Settlement Agreement  \n\n--- Page 457 ---\n \n \n \n 426 DRAFTING  \n  Clarity of expression. \n  Managing and assimilating facts and their ordering them. \n  General reading skills. \nGENERAL RULES OF DRAFTING \nThere are some key points to bear in mind when drafting; you can call these rules if you like, which are applied during the planning process. Drafting is an exercise in communi -\ncation, and like all forms of communication the sender of the message and the receiver of it need to be talking the ‘same language’ to be understood. So it is important to avoid ambiguity, repetition or confusion. \nThose who draft legislation (Parliamentary Counsel), for instance, as well as decid -\ning whether the draft bill should be divided into parts and/or Schedules (the document’s structure), also make decisions about choice of language. These drafters try to ensure that as far as possible the language used in the statute is suitably clear and general; writing in plain English will make it both understandable and capable of being applied to new but connected situations, see the chapter on ‘Domestic legislation’ (Chapter 1 ). \nThe importance here is that the legislation once passed and in force can be interpreted without ambiguity or confusion by all who need to read and apply it. \nWho is your audience? \nBefore undertaking any drafting task, whether it be composing a letter or email, drafting a legal document such as a contract or a court form or document (called pleadings) during litigation, as part of the planning process you should think about your target audience and what you want to communicate to that audience. What is the intention of the drafting exer -\ncise and what is it that you want that audience or recipient to learn and understand from it? \nLanguage therefore is important and communication style will depend on the nature \nof the exercise and your target audience. For instance, writing in the capacity of a lawyer, letters or emails written to ‘lay clients’\n1 should be stylistically different from those writ -\nten to other lawyers, often referred to as ‘the other side’. Your client will not be a lawyer, they will not understand legal jargon (sometimes called ‘legalese’) and therefore clarity of terms and expressions which your client will understand are required for effective com -\nmunication. Essentially the use of ‘plain English’ is key here. \nLike much that is involved in the study of law or any academic discipline for that matter, \neffective preparation is crucial. It is therefore a good idea to make some notes on what it is you intend to achieve with the drafting exercise upon which you are embarking. There will be a need to assimilate facts and order them logically. The following are therefore important to bear in mind: \n  Precedents . Does the document you are proposing to draft have a helpful precedent \nor template which you can use to base it on? For example, if drafting a will, there are \n1 L ay clients are those for whose beneft or on behalf of whom the Barrister is instructed by the Professional \nClient (a Solicitor) to provide the Services (who may be the Professional Client where the Case concerns \nthe affairs of a Professional Client). \n\n--- Page 458 ---\n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n DRAFTING 427 \nusually a whole range of templates available depending on the complexity of the will \ndrafting exercise. This will give you the structure to work with. \n  The message . If using a precedent, how do you want to fll the spaces in order to \nconvey the message? For instance, with a Claim Form in a civil dispute, which is a standard form that can be downloaded from the internet, this needs to be completed with some specifc and perhaps more general information in the boxes provided. Sometimes these forms will have guidance notes to assist you in completing the form (see example in Figure 16 .3). \n  Accuracy . Ensure that what has been included in the document you are drafting \nconveys an accurate message. Any errors can cause problems later on. If you do not complete a court document with the addresses for service, for instance, then the court will not be able to serve the document and it will be returned unissued. If the matter in hand is ‘time sensitive’, this can be costly. \nRylance maintains that the frst rule of writing and drafting is to begin by thinking and then keep thinking about the needs of your readers. Try to acquire the habit of writing every letter and drafting every document as if your clients, or other intended readers, are watching over one shoulder. It would be prudent to become conscious of the court, or other tribunal, lurking over the other.\n2 \nGrammar \nThe key to all good writing and drafting is the confdent use of correct grammar and punc -\ntuation. Understanding grammar, punctuation and spelling conventions will help you to produce good writing and drafting. The section on ‘Use of language’ in Chapter 10, ‘Writing \nlaw essays’, will be helpful here and you can refer back to this chapter for additional guid -\nance on the correct use of grammar to assist you with your writing and drafting techniques. \nWhat is grammar? \nA simple defnition of grammar is: \nA set of rules about the use of a language that describes: \n(1) The standardised acceptable use of words. (2) The acceptable methods for sentence construction (word order in a sentence); \ntechnically this is the study of syntax. \n(3) The acceptable methods for word construction, dealing with the small parts of \nwords; technically this is the study of morphology. \nAll languages have grammar: sets of rules determining their appropriate use in the rel -\nevant community of language users. However, there is a general lack of precision about \n2 P . Rylance, Writing and Drafting in Legal Practice (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2012), 4–5. \n\n--- Page 459 ---\n 428 DRAFTING  \nwhat the rules of English grammar might be. This is in part due to the fact that English is \nthe result of many different language traditions. English also has a massive vocabulary, with extensive synonyms (words that mean the same thing). \nThere is arguably nothing worse than reading a letter or document which is poorly \npresented and lacks grammatical accuracy. There is no excuse for poor spelling as nowa -\ndays all letters and documents are prepared in electronic format using computer soft -\nware, and auto-correct, as well as other available functions, will help to improve your spelling and grammar. \nHowever, as Rylance argues, whilst not suggesting that you abandon or ignore gram -\nmatical rules entirely, as he says that there is much disagreement about rules of English grammar, even where there is agreement, the rule is often subject to numerous excep -\ntions and the truth is that failure to observe rules, whether from ignorance or for conveni -\nence, does not usually affect the meaning.\n3 \nIt appears therefore that if this is to be accepted, minor grammatical errors should be \nforgiven so long as the meaning of the drafting exercise is communicated/conveyed to the reader. \nWhat follows is not a lesson in English grammar, because as university students you \nwill have acquired the basics of English grammar at school and the section on ‘Use of language’ in Chapter 10 will also be helpful to you. Detailed explanation of grammatical rules, subtleties and nuances in the context of legal drafting is also beyond the scope of this text as these requirements will be more applicable to practice, and the chances are that any drafting exercise you are required to complete as part of an assignment at this stage of your studies, will respect the level of your legal knowledge and understanding. You should, however, bear in mind some grammatical guidelines when embarking on your drafting exercise as part of your studies. \nParagraphs and sentences \nHow these are constructed will have a bearing on the overall structure and presentation of your drafting exercise. Paragraphs are a collection of separate sentences which may vary in length. Each paragraph should deal with a discreet and specifc topic. With legal documents, paragraphs are often numbered for clarity and ease of reference. As will be mentioned below, when considering the structure of your letter drafting exercise, head -\nings, subheadings, numbering and bullet points are permitted. A good piece of drafting logically addresses the subject matter in a sequential way, dealing with each specifc theme or topic before moving to the next. \nAbbreviations, jargon and slang \nSlang words such as kids  or mates  should be avoided at all costs. Such usage is a con -\ntextually sloppy use of English and inappropriate for legal writing. An element of formality or correct plain English is expected and acceptable. The use of jargon may be permitted, but it very much depends on the context and your target audience. For instance, using such Latin phrases as inter alia  (among other things) or res ipsa loquitur  (the thing speaks \n3 Ibid., 35. \n\n--- Page 460 ---\n  \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n      \n  \n   \n \n \n DRAFTING 429 \nfor itself) would be inappropriate and out of place in a letter to a client (more than anything \nthey will not understand what you are talking about), however, contextually permissible in a letter to another solicitor. Abbreviations such as ADR are also acceptable as long as the frst time they are used in your piece of writing, they are defned as such and in this way: Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), for example. \nEnglish dictionaries \nDictionaries are not just places to fnd out about spelling; they also give valuable detail on how to use a word, its derivation, how to pronounce it and what it means in differing con -\ntexts. For those students whose frst language is not English the Collins Cobuild English Dictionary  (which has separate editions at beginner, intermediate and advanced level) \ngives you a sophisticated understanding of word usage. For native English speakers, as well as their online dictionary,\n4 Collins also publishes the Collins English Paperback \nDictionary and Thesaurus  set.5 Another good dictionary provider is the Oxford English \nDictionary  series. You could consider the Oxford English Dictionary Paperback .6 Oxford \nalso has a good online presence which your library may subscribe to.7 \nA thesaurus \nThesauri give you synonyms: words meaning the same thing. If you feel that you are repeating a word too much, its capacity to give other words meaning the same thing is extremely useful. The most well-known thesaurus is Roget’s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases\n8 and now Roget’s Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases 150th-Anniver -\nsary International Edition .9 Both of these can also be accessed online.10 Collins, however, \nhas got an alpha thesaurus, The Collins Gem English Thesaurus .11 Oxford also provides \nthe Oxford Paperback Thesaurus .12 \nLaw dictionaries \nLaw dictionaries are invaluable for locating the meaning of technical terms. They will defne the main terms, as well as concepts and processes of the English legal system. They will include summaries of major areas of law. Many are in print and online and the online versions offer extra links to other reference sites. Your university department may have preferred law dictionaries that they wish you to use, and your library may have online subscriptions to these. Recommended dictionaries include the Oxford Dictionary of Law .\n13 \n4 www.collinsdictionary.com . \n5 C ollins (2nd edition, 2015). \n6 7 th edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2013. \n7 A vailable at https://www.oed.com. \n8 Penguin, London, 2004. \n9 Penguin, London, 2019. 10 Available at https:// www.thesaurus.com. \n11 Collins, London, 2016. \n12 4th edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2012. \n13 J Law, (Editor) (9th edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2018). \n\n--- Page 461 ---\n \n \n \n   430 DRAFTING  \nThe HM Courts and Tribunal Service provides an alpha listing of the meanings for legal \nterms used in court. \nMany libraries will stock a range of law dictionaries. Two particularly good options are \nThe Longman Dictionary of Law14 and Osborn’s Concise Law Dictionary .15 \nLegal writing dos and don’ts: some rules of grammar: \n  Do not use overlong paragraphs and sentences; \n  Deal with one topic in one paragraph; \n  Do not use slang words; \n  Use spell check and other computer functions to ensure accuracy; \n  Make use of dictionaries and thesauri for guidance. \nLetter writing \nThe frst rule of effective letter writing is good preparation. Once you have chosen your \naudience (the proposed recipient of your letter) it is always wise to prepare some brief notes on the subject matter of the letter. These notes should include what it is you want to achieve with this method of communication, or in other words its objective. As a law student an assignment may require you to write a letter of advice to a client based on a certain legal scenario. Such a drafting exercise may be intended to simulate the kind of client advice letter that a legal practitioner may be required to write in order to obtain instructions from a client. In which case, you will need to carefully consider the needs and concerns of your client, what advice you should be giving, its scope and any supportive authority which may be applicable. With a letter to a client, it may be helpful at this stage to imagine yourself in your client’s shoes. This will help to write an audience-appropriate letter and one which your client will hopefully understand. \nTo achieve the letter’s objective a good client advice letter should aim to be concise, \nclear and unambiguous. Webb et al. suggest that particular letter-writing problems con-cern the failure to consider the needs of the reader, verbose sentences and the use of redundant and technical words and phrases. Poor structure and layout can make the letter diffcult to understand and its aims and objectives may therefore not be achieved.\n16 \nStyle \nLetter-writing style should be considered. If you know your client well, then a measure of informality in address may be permitted and it is quite acceptable to use frst name terms. In which case the letter should be signed off Yours sincerely . Similarly, the form \nYours sincerely  can be used if your client is less well known to you (perhaps a new cli -\nent) and you are addressing them by their surname. If writing to another frm of solicitors, however, then the salutation should be Dear Sir or Madam and signed off Yours faithfully . \n14 P H Richards and L B Curzon (Editors) (8th edition, Longman, London, 2011). \n15 M Woodley (Editor) (12th edition, Sweet and Maxwell, London, 2013). \n16 J Webb, C Maughan, M Maughan, M Keppel-Palmer and A Boon, Lawyers’ Skills (22nd edition, Oxford \nUniversity Press, Oxford, 2019), 46. \n\n--- Page 462 ---\n  \n \n \n \n DRAFTING 431 \nThe heading should be brief and concise, indicating the nature of the matter you are writ -\ning about, e.g. Re: Your Claim Against ABC Ltd. The addresses of both your frm (if not \nalready on the letter headed paper) and the addressee should appear at the top of the letter. \nStructure \nHeadings, subheadings, numbering and bullet points are permitted and will assist with structure. Certainly, in a long letter to a client, another solicitor, or a third party, the aims and objectives of the letter can sometimes be more easily followed and understood if such conventions are used. It may also enable your correspondent to respond to your let -\nter more accurately by making reference to specifc numbered paragraphs, for instance. \nAs mentioned above, paragraphs should not be overlong and should deal with a specifc \ntheme or topic. You should refrain from jumping about with topics for discussion in one single paragraph. Try to keep sentences short and concise and refrain from using unneces -\nsary words. By using short sentences, you will also avoid grammatical errors. Short para -\ngraphs favourably assist the presentation of your work and make it easier to read. \nContent \nThe opening of the letter should refer to the last communication. If it was a meeting, then write: Further to our meeting on … Depending on whether the letter is to advise, seek \ninstructions or to report, the content of your letter, whatever its purpose, should cover the main points in the logical structure that you have mapped out for your reader. As mentioned earlier, headings may assist here. The letter should conclude with a summary of the steps required (if any). Note the intention, the logical structure, the content of the letter and the steps required (within an appropriate time-frame if relevant), in Figure 16 .1 \nfor an idea of the content of a letter of claim to an alleged tortfeasor. \nAn exercise \nAs an ‘in-class’ exercise, it might be helpful from an experiential learning perspective \nto draft a brief letter of advice based on a particular legal issue and then swap it with your neighbour in class. \nThen undertake an exercise in peer review if you like. When you have read your \nneighbour’s letter, consider the points discussed above and answer these questions: \n  Fundamentally, does the letter achieve its objective? \n  If it is to give advice, then has it provided the kind of advice you need? That you structure and present your work logically. \n  Is it written clearly, concisely and unambiguously and with grammatical accuracy? \n\n--- Page 463 ---\n \n 432 DRAFTING  \n  Is it easy to follow? Here you can consider the letter’s structure (does the letter \nhave suitable paragraph breaks, for instance, and/or headings/sub-headings/ numbering, which is permitted?). \nThe example provided in Figure 16 .1 is a letter of claim to an employer of a client concern -\ning an accident at work. Within this letter, take note of the following formalities: namely the position of the address and date at the top of the letter, the salutation and the heading. Then note the way in which the letter is signed off; this is consistent with the salutation. When considering the body of the letter, note the way that it has been structured (it uses clear headings). It provides confrmation of its intention. The letter then goes on to sum -\nmarise the facts and consider the relevant law. \nThe general purpose of this letter is to confrm that as legal advisor you have received \ninstructions to act for your client in a civil claim for damages against the company you are writing to. It provides an outline of the issues concerning the matter, including the cir -\ncumstances of the accident, the reason fault is alleged (including details of both common law and statutory breach), brief details of the injury and loss sustained by your client and concludes with the required action which you ask should be taken, including a request for disclosure of documents and other information which may be relevant as well as a request that the company’s insurers be informed of the claim. \nStandard forms and precedents \nPrecedents \nOnce the drafting exercise has been planned and the skeleton of your proposed docu -\nment mapped out, you may wish to use a precedent or template to assist you in drafting your document. Most law frms have precedent banks linked to their word processing systems to avoid the need to draft documents from scratch each time they embark on a drafting exercise. \nStudents of law can turn to online sources where they will fnd helpful precedents and \ntemplates. Traditionally these were found in loose-leaf texts such as The Encyclopaedia of Forms & Precedents , now they are available online and the leading publishers such as \nWestlaw and LexisLibrary have developed their own platforms where precedents can be accessed. \nA word of warning, however: legal practitioners and law students should never slav -\nishly rely on precedents when drafting. They should be used as a guide and as a checklist which will often assist with the structure of the proposed document. As Emmet says, over-reliance on precedents has caused confusion among some students in the past; they have followed precedents to the letter in their drafting, thinking they must be drafting to a very high standard and are puzzled when criticised for it.\n17 \nFigure 16.2 shows you a standard precedent for a Particulars of Claim in an action \nfor private nuisance taken from the Westlaw database. The template will then need to be \n17 D. Emmett (Ed), Drafting  (19th edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2018), 4. \n\n--- Page 464 ---\n  \n  \n \n                                     \n               \n                   DRAFTING 433 \namended and the relevant specifc details included to ensure that the document fulfls \nits purpose. Simply copying the precedent without deleting unnecessary and irrelevant material or clauses appearing in the precedent will potentially alter the purpose and inten -\ntion of the document and is very poor practice. To do so is simply form flling not drafting and should be avoided. \nStandard forms \nNowadays, most law frms will have a good bank of standard forms and letters which will include frequently used boilerplate clauses for standard documents in specifc transac -\ntional work, for instance, clauses in commercial leases. \nStandard solicitor/client letters will include the client care letter, which is sector policy \nonce the frm has been instructed to act and which includes among other things the terms and conditions of the retainer or engagement. The SRA provides guidance on what should be included in client care letters and this information will be incorporated into the standard template letter.\n18 \nThese and other regularly used documents will be saved on the frm’s integrated word \nprocessing system. Some lawyers will also save documents from previous fles to use in the future for guidance and checking should a similar legal matter arise and when the same kind of document is required. \nThose legal practitioners operating in the area of civil litigation or dispute resolution, \nfor example, will frequently receive instructions from clients to commence court proceed -\nings. Commencement of civil proceedings will require the completion of an N1 Claim Form, which is a standard form available on the internet and which can be downloaded for completion with the relevant details.\n19 \nFigure 16 .3 shows the frst page of an example N1 Claim Form, which has been com -\npleted after taking instructions from a client pursuing a claim for damages due to having sustained personal injury. The Claim Form required is the one pursuant to Part 7 of the Civil Procedure Rules. It has been downloaded as a pdf from the www.gov.uk website \nand then completed electronically.

In which case the guidelines and conventions set out above will assist you with the drafting exercise. The letter or document you are drafting may have a template or precedent upon which you can base it. But remember to consider the needs of your audience, the choice of words, structure and layout. \nWith all this in mind, the document should be easy to read.

Consider, for instance, the document which has been drafted at Figure 16 .4. It is a mediation settle -\nment agreement that records the outcome of a mediation concerning a dispute involving the sale and purchase of a car. This document is effectively an agreement that records and evidences the terms which have been reached by the parties to settle their dispute. The document therefore needs to be clear, concise and capable of being implemented. \nCONCLUSION \nEffective writing and drafting depends on your understanding of what exercise you have been asked to undertake. It will involve appropriate reading and research, your use of cor -\nrect grammar, punctuation and spelling, as well as the development of an effective writ -\ning/drafting style. As Rose suggests, it is now clearly appreciated that a need for a sound, basic understanding of the principles of drafting is vital to both branches of the (legal) pro -\nfession, in light of the reforms in civil procedure that have now taken place.\n20 Regardless \nof whether your aspirations include a legal career, this chapter should have provided you with some sound foundational guidance in the art of ‘good drafting’ techniques. \nCHAPTER SUMMARY \n  You should be able to make use of a range of skills required for academic drafting. \n  It is very important to establish who your audience is. \n  Writing and drafting with grammatical accuracy is important. \n  Take account of the conventions involved in effective letter writing. \n  Make use of standard forms and precedents, which can be used to assist your draft -\ning exercise. \n  Ensure that you structure and present your work logically. \n  Make sure you proofread your draft document carefully for errors of spelling, punc -\ntuation and grammar, as well as the fow of your work through paragraphs to ensure that you have followed your instructions. \n20 W Rose, Pleadings Without Tears  (9th edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford , 2017). \n\n--- Page 466 ---\n \n  \n CONCLUSIONS \nThis text has attempted to provide a clear view of the practicalities of studying law, focus -\ning on the required skills of general study, reading legal texts, argument construction, \nwriting and oral presentation. We have also discussed ways of developing good inde -\npendent study habits and approaches to ‘breaking into’ texts to understand the fexibility and the inherent unreliability of language in a discipline that centres on the power of ‘the word’ and of language generally. \nThis brief conclusion fnishes by signalling that only a partial understanding is reached \nif you do not consider the power inherent in any rule imbued with the authority of law. By this is meant the power inherent in law’s context and status, its privileged authority over other institutions, and the power of those who interpret it and create it. \nLaw is applied, used or created by people acting in roles dealing with the memories \nof the law. Much time has been spent looking at mechanistic schemes for understanding legal words, legal texts, intertextual and intratextual links and the arguments for the out -\ncome of the case. However, as Goodrich states, ‘reading is never innocent’.\n1 \nThere are vast dimensions of legal analysis untouched, ready to be tackled by pol -\niticians, philosophers, feminists, criminologists or sociologists. And there are a range of ever-present, yet buried, motivational issues, such as why did the judge adopt that interpretation? Or which rationale for adopting that interpretation do ‘I’ believe? Was that legislation motivated by economics or welfare? We have considered a few raw legal arguments and have noted the reasons given to support outcomes. But valuable issues can also be raised by asking why the judge did not choose to take another plausible interpretation. \nJudgments are the end result after parties and witnesses put their sides’ case, via \noffcial and tortuous questioning. They take place in situations where rules of evidence, magistrates and judges control what is and what is not said, by whom, and how it is said. Lawyers, judges and offcials control defnitions too, as well as choosing interim and ultimate interpretations. Legal texts are never unambiguous representations of the law. They are the words from which interpretations fow. At the level of the obvious, the voice \n1 P Goodrich Reading the Law: Critical Introduction to Legal Method and Techniques (Wiley-Blackwell, \nOxford, 1986), 231. \nDOI: 10.4324/9780429285080-102  \n\n--- Page 467 ---\n 436 CONCLUSIONS  \nof consensus states: ‘we all know what this means, don ’t we?’  Equally, this can be said in \na tone of incredulity, or of ridicule: ‘we all know  what this means, don’t we?’ \nIn their texts, judges build one offcial story, one offcial ending. But the story can often \nbe very different, and so could the ending. The bricks for building are words. Despite our \nfocus on study skills, English language skills, legal method skills and their interrelation -\nship with substantive law and solving legal problems, it is the landscape that decides it all. The landscape of the offcials, the institutions, politics, the judiciary, the police and policy all have an infuence. \nThe critical thinker has to remain engaged not only in micro-questions within texts, but \nalso in macro-questions at the level of law, politics and culture. This includes considering text as the product of a culture, continuing the search for underlying assumptions. \nMuch law degree study will revolve around ‘fghting’ with the language of, and argu -\nments in, cases – reconciling, distinguishing and/or following them and explaining differ -\nences of interpretation where some might say there are no differences. Students learn a growing body of rules and, more and more, the overarching context of institutions and culture shrinks into the background. They may be interesting from an academic perspec -\ntive, but cultural legal content has no place in the everyday life of the law and its media -\ntion of competing interests. It is in the interest of these legal institutional values that the legal ‘story’ is the one that covers all. But there is a danger that the daily process of doing the law blinds the ‘doers’ (the practitioners) to the motivational infuences of some insti -\ntutional creators of law. The law as language is to be read, interpreted, questioned and seen in its fragmented contexts, to be the object of a healthy scepticism. It should not be invested with qualities it cannot control. Law is not justice, for indeed justice may demand that there be no law. \nWhen deciding what words mean in court, judges make far-reaching decisions and \nmaintain that they do so, not on grounds of morality, religion, justice or ethics, but purely as a true interpretation of the words. They support the orthodox view that law is a neutral instrument to achieve a moral society. Law is objective, rational and logical, and one must believe in the ultimate good of the law and the ultimate ability of the law to determine what the law means. A problem can now be seen. As pointed out above, the law is not an autonomous neutral agent; it is used by people in a political and social role. Legal texts can be analysed as social texts created by social actors. Statutes are texts com -\nmunicated via words created by politicians in compromise and interpreted by judges for a range of reasons, some explicit, some not. Can discussions about law, therefore, ever be justifably separated from discussions about power (especially since access to law making power is only available to players in the higher levels of politics or professionals in the higher judiciary)? \nLaw is not logical, nor does it have to be. There is a social agreement that, for a range \nof reasons – political, social and moral – English law should be seen to be fair. But to apply a rule to a problem requires the clarifcation of the problem and proof that the facts of the problem as presented are the facts that occurred. Rules have developed that state \n\n--- Page 468 ---\n  CONCLUSIONS 437 \nwhat must be proved by testimonial or forensic evidence and when evidence itself must \nbe backed up. \nDue to the history of common law, its oral nature of proceedings, the breaking away of \ncourts from the royal household, the ultimate ascendancy of statutory law and the com -\nplete reorganisation of the courts of England and Wales in 1875 and 1978, we now have a system of law which is based upon the reaction to arguments presented to those offcials who decide which argument is legitimate, be they negotiators in offces, tribunals and juries, magistrates’ or appellate courts. We have also developed more sophisticated and imaginative ways of resolving disputes through Alternative Dispute Resolution processes. \nAs you fnish your frst-year journey about study skills, language use, fnding and han -\ndling legal rules, and after the study of the range of modules involved in getting your law degree, look forward to your next journey. Always try to keep the wider issues of law and its contexts and power in mind. As you develop through the stages of your academic legal study you will increasingly be called upon to ponder some of these issues and more; you will be required to spend more time tracing a critical pathway in your work. These are important tasks and may even become a life work for you. \n\n--- Page 470 ---\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n FURTHER READING \nAND USEFUL WEBSITES \nFURTHER READING \nAnderson T., Schum D. and Twining W.

Cohen\n26.1 Introduction\nTopic models are a set of statistical models and mathematical techniques used to analyze \ntextual data. Their purpose is to extract information about the underlying meaning and \nrelationships within a collection of related texts. These models estimate latent topics, which \nare clusters of words that represent common themes in the text data. Initially developed \nfor machine learning and information retrieval, some topic models have gained interest in \neducational measurement for scoring and analyzing constructed-  response items and mixed-  \nformat assessments.\nA large amount of research in computerized analysis of textual data in educational \nand psychological measurement has focused on creating accurate, reliable, and unbiased \nalgorithms for scoring essays. These algorithms aim to mimic human scores by considering \nthe variation in essay features and the scores assigned by human raters. Well-  known \nautomated essay scoring algorithms, such as the Intelligent Essay Assessor (IEA; Foltz et al., \n1999 ), utilize a variety of topics models that are covered in other chapters of this book, \nincluding Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA; Deerwester et al., 1990 ), the bigram topic model \n(Wallach, 2006 ), the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers topic model \n(BERT; Devlin et al., 2018 ), the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE; Wang \net al., 2018 ), and other autoencoder topic models (e.g., Chen & Zaki, 2017 ; Vaswani et al., \n2017 ; Wu et al., 2019 ; Zhan et al., 2018 ).\nAlthough these algorithms have made significant advancements, current research \nsuggests that valuable information about students’ abilities may be overlooked, and that \nscores alone do not provide a complete picture. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA; Blei \net al., 2003 ) is a topic model that has been increasingly used in educational and psycho -\nlogical measurement as a technique to better understand students’ writing and gain add -\nitional information about students’ knowledge beyond the scores provided. Recent research \nin educational measurement has shown that LDA can improve test development and edu -\ncational practices, detect effects from instructional interventions, and be used in the scoring \nof essays and assessments. \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n--- Page 2 ---\nJordan M. Wheeler, Shiyu Wang, and Allan S. Cohen\n536LDA has potential usefulness in test development and instructional practices. For example, \nShin, Guo, and Gierl (2019)  applied LDA to analyze written responses to test items. The \nLDA analysis identified common misconceptions that student possessed. The researchers \nused these results to develop distractors for multiple-  choice items. Wheeler et al. (2024)  \ndemonstrated an application of LDA that extracts and summarizes examinees’ reasoning \nwhen responding to constructed response items using essays. The findings indicated that \nLDA can serve as a valuable tool for offering validity evidence and informing instructional \napproaches for essays. The study demonstrated that LDA provided important insights into \nthe thought processes and reasoning of students.\nAdditionally, LDA has been used to detect the effects from instructional interventions. \nFor instance, Kim et al. (2017)  found that analyzing essays from a pre-  test and post-  test \nusing LDA revealed evidence that an instructional intervention helped students improve \ntheir use of academic language, despite no observable improvement in essay scores. That \nis, the LDA topic model detected instructional effects that were not captured by the change \nin essay scores from pre-  test to post-  test. Duong et al. (2019)  used LDA to analyze essay \nresponses on integrative borrowing, revealing the effectiveness of instructional conver -\nsation in enhancing students’ understanding of multiple perspectives. Choi et al. (2017)  \ndemonstrated how LDA can be used to detect a shift in the language students use when \nresponding to a prompt. In that study, LDA showed that students shifted from using \neveryday language to academic language following an instructional intervention. Kwak \net al. (2017a , 2017b ) demonstrated the ability of LDA to detect changes in topics used by \nstudents following an instruction intervention.\nRecent endeavors have also focused on integrating LDA with popular psychometric \nmodels. For example, Wheeler et al. (2022b)  introduced a new scoring approach for item-  \nresponse theory (IRT) models by using the results from LDA. The study adapted a process-  \ndata-  based scoring procedure to educational assessments that contained textual responses \n(i.e., constructed response items). The methodology used the results of the LDA model from \nthe textual data on the assessments to improve the latent ability estimates of examinees. \nResults showed that incorporating LDA into IRT scoring provided more reliable results \nthan traditional scoring procedures for IRT.\n26.1.1  Purpose of the Chapter\nThe use of topic models is an emerging field of research in educational and psychological \nmeasurement and aims to develop a more holistic approach to evaluating students’ writing \nthat goes beyond reproducing rubric-  based scores. Specifically, the use of LDA as a technique \nfor evaluating essays has shown promising results and the potential for being augmented \nwith other evaluation techniques and models (Wheeler et al., 2023). This chapter aims to \nprovide a comprehensive introduction of the LDA topic model and its role in educational \nand psychological measurement. The remainder of the chapter introduces the statistical \nformulation of LDA, outlines the essential data preprocessing and postprocessing steps \nrequired for estimating LDA, provides an example illustrating the estimation of LDA using \nempirical data collected from an essay on an educational assessment, and concludes with \nsome thoughts on the future prospects of utilizing LDA. Additionally, generalized R and \nPython code are provided in the appendix to provide the reader the opportunity to easily \nimplement the LDA model.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 3 ---\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation of Constructed Responses\n53726.2 Latent Dirichlet Allocation\nLDA is a statistical topic model initially developed to process large volumes of textual data \nin order to generate useful measures for downstream tasks, such as clustering, classification, \nindexing, and summarization. It operates as a joint probabilistic model that employs a hier -\narchical structure to identify latent topics within a collection of texts and the usage of these \nlatent topics within each text. The collection of texts constitutes the corpus, where each \ntext is a combination of weighted mixtures from a predetermined number of latent topics. \nLikewise, each latent topic is a weighted mixture over the vocabulary, which is the set of \nunique words that appear in the corpus ( Blei et al., 2010 ). This section introduces the LDA \nmodel from three perspectives: probabilistic model, generative model, and graphical model.\n26.2.1  LDA Model Parameters\nSuppose there is a corpus with kK=…1, ,  corpus-  wide topics and dD=…1, ,  documents. \nA document is denoted as wd and contains Nd words. The LDA model estimates three \nkey parameters from a corpus of documents: a set of word probabilities βk for each topic; \na set of topic proportions τd for each document; and a set of topic assignments td for \neach document, which represents the topic membership (i.e., assignment) of each word in \na document.\nA topic represents a set of probabilities over the words in the vocabulary, which consists \nof the V unique words found across all documents in the corpus. The word probabil -\nities in a topic indicate the likelihood of each word from the vocabulary appearing under \nthat specific topic. Each document is assigned a set of topic proportions, which is a vector \nrepresenting the proportions of each topic used in the document. Additionally, each word \nin a document is assigned a topic, indicating its membership within a particular topic.\nThe LDA model follows a hierarchical mixture model framework, where topics are \ncorpus-  wide parameters, topic proportions are document-  wide parameters, and topic \nassignments are word-  level parameters. The key idea is that topics are word probabilities \nfor the words in the vocabulary and topic proportions are mixtures of topics.\n26.2.2  LDA as a Graphical Model\nFigure 26.1  provides a graphical representation of LDA, illustrating three rectangular plates \nrepresenting the levels of documents, words, and topics within the data ( Blei et al., 2003 ). \nThe document level accounts for the replication of documents, the word level captures \nFigure 26.1   Graphical Plate Representation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation. \n \n \n   \n\n--- Page 4 ---\nJordan M. Wheeler, Shiyu Wang, and Allan S. Cohen\n538multiple words within each document, and the topic level signifies the estimation of mul -\ntiple topics.\nIn the graphical model, variables are represented by circles and their placement inside the \nplates signifies their respective levels. The word probability variable is located at the topic \nlevel, the topic proportion variable is located at the document level, and the topic and word \nvariables are situated at the word level. Shaded circles indicate observed variables, while \nunshaded circles represent latent variables. In the LDA model, only words are observed \nvariables, whereas the other variables are latent and are inferred from the observed data. \nThe document and topic priors are hyperparameter variables in the LDA that control the \nconcentration of word probabilities for topics and topic proportions for documents. The \ndirectional arrows depict the relationships between variables, with the variable at the \narrowhead depending on the variable at the tail.\n26.2.3  LDA as a Generative Model\nLDA functions under an assumed generative process that explains how the documents in \nthe corpus are created. The LDA generative model assumes that a corpus is generated \nthrough the following process ( Blei et al, 2003 ; Blei & Lafferty, 2009 ):\nA corpus consists of K topics (assumed a priori) where the word probabilities for \neach topic kK ,,=…1  is assumed to be generated from a Dirichlet distribution such \nthat βνkDirichlet~ (). Then, the generative model assumes that each document \ndD ,,=…1  is generated as follows:\n1. Generate the length of the document, NP oissond∼ ()λ\n2. Generate the topic proportions of the document, τηdDirichlet∼ ()\n3. For each word in the document, indexed as nNd∈…{}1, , :\ni. Generate topic assignment tM ultinomialnd∼ ()τ\nii. Given the topic assignment, generate word wM ultinomialnk tn∼ () =β\n26.2.4  LDA as a Probabilistic Model\nThe joint distribution for the observed word variables ():w1D, the latent topic assignment \nvariables ( t1:D), the word probabilities for each topic  ():β1K,  and the topic proportions ():τ1D     \nis given by:\n pDD KDwt11 11 :: ::,, ,| ,, βτην ()  (26.1)\nwhere η and ν represent prior hyperparameters. The joint distribution for LDA can \nbe factorized into conditional distributions and priors as follows ( Blei et al., 2003 ; \nPonweiser, 2012 ):\n pp ppDD KD DD KD Dwt wt t11 11 11 11 1 :: :: :: :: :,, ,| ,, ,βτην βτ() =() () ||β βν τη11 ::|| .KDp () ()  (26.2) \n \n \n  \n  \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation of Constructed Responses\n539In Equation (2), pwtDD K11 1 :: :, |β ()  represents the conditional distribution of the observed \nwords given the topic assignments and word probabilities of the topics and is assumed \nto follow a multinomial distribution; ptDD11 ::|τ()  represents the conditional distribution \nof topic assignments given the topic proportions and is assumed to follow a multinomial \ndistribution; pβν1:|K()  represents the prior distribution for the word probabilities for the \ntopics and is assumed to follow a Dirichlet distribution where ν is the hyperparameter \nthat controls the density of word probabilities; pτη1:|D()  represents the prior distribution \nfor the topic proportions and is assumed to follow a Dirichlet distribution where η is the \nhyperparameter that controls the density of topic proportions.\nSince the joint distribution is intractable due to its high dimensionality (the number of \ndocuments, the size of the vocabulary, and the number of topics), LDA infers the latent \nparameters ( t1:D, β1:K, and τ1:D) using the conditional distribution of these parameters \ngiven the observed words ptwDK DD 11 11 :: ::,, |βτ() . This distribution is known as the pos -\nterior distribution, which is proportional to the joint distribution in Equation (1). The LDA \nposterior distribution is expressed as:\n pptw wtDK DD DD KD 11 11 11 11 :: :: :: ::,, |, , ,βτ βτ () ∝()  (26.3)\nGiven the dimensionality of the corpus ( D, K, and Ndd D,,∀∈ … {}1 ) and the factorization \nin Equation (2), the posterior distribution can be factorized as:\npp pp wkK\nk dD\nd nN\ndndtwDKDD11 11 11 1 :: :: ,,, |βτ βν τη() ∝ () ()== =∏∏ ∏ || || |tp tdn kt dn ddn,,,\n,βτ= ( )() ()\n\n (26.4)\n26.2.5  Extension to LDA\nA variation of LDA is the supervised LDA (sLDA; McAuliffe & Blei, 2008 ) model. Similar \nto the LDA model, the sLDA model estimates the topic distribution over the vocabulary \nand the topic proportions for each document. However, the key distinction is that the sLDA \nmodel incorporates the relationship between individual topic assignments and an observed \ndependent variable ( Perotte et al., 2011 ).\nFigure 26.2  presents a graphical model depicting sLDA. In Figure 26.2 , the plates \nrepresent the different levels of data, while the circles represent the model’s variables. The \nplacement of the circles within the plates indicates the level at which each variable occurs. \nThe arrows illustrate the relationships between the variables. Figure 26.2  includes a shaded \ncircle representing a dependent variable, indicating an observed variable at the document \nlevel, such as a classification, score, or ability estimate. Furthermore, an arrow signifies the \ndependency between the dependent variable and the topics.\nIn the sLDA model, the dependency between the dependent variables and the topics is \ncaptured by regressing the dependent variable on the topics ( McAuliffe & Blei, 2008 ), thus \nenhancing the predictive power of the topics with respect to the dependent variable. For  \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 6 ---\nJordan M. Wheeler, Shiyu Wang, and Allan S. Cohen\n540example, in the context of predicting movie ratings, McAuliffe and Blei (2008)  found that \nthe sLDA model outperformed the LDA model when followed by regression.\nThe sLDA graphical model depicted in Figure 26.2  can also be defined as the joint prob -\nability distribution presented in Equation (4), with an additional model for the dependent \nvariable. Although the dependent variable for the sLDA model can be continuous, it is often \ndiscrete since the dependent variable often represents a classification or discrete score from \na rubric. When the dependent variable is discrete, the sLDA model employs a generalized \nlinear model to capture its characteristics:\n yG LMdd d|, ,, , ttζδ ζδ ∼ () , (26.5)\nwhere y represents the dependent variables for each document, t represents the topics for \neach word in each document, and ζ and δ denote the priors for the dependent variable in \nthe generalized linear model.\n26.2.6  Understanding Word Probabilities of Topics and Topic Proportions\nThe two major results from the LDA and sLDA models are the word probabilities of topics \nand the topic proportions. The word probabilities of topics provide a description of the \ncorpus, highlighting the main themes within the documents. Figure 26.3  illustrates examples \nof word probability distributions of topics. The x- axis represents each word in the vocabu -\nlary and the y- axis represents their respective probabilities (i.e., weights). The plots are with \nthe words most likely to occur to the left (i.e., highest probabilities) and words least likely \nto occur to the right (i.e., lowest probabilities). These probabilities can also be interpreted \nas proportions or frequencies. For example, word W15  has the highest probability for \nTopic 1. By sorting words in each topic, it is possible to obtain a list of words most likely \nto occur in each topic (e.g., W15, W10,  and W124  for Topic 1). The words that are most \nlikely to occur for a given topic can help identify the topic and its use in the corpus.\nThe estimated topic proportions are used to describe individual documents within the \ncorpus. Figure 26.4  illustrates how proportions for the same three topics might be viewed for \neach document. The x- axis represents each topic and the y- axis represents their respective \nFigure 26.2   Graphical Representation of Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation. \n \n  \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation of Constructed Responses\n541proportions. The topic proportions of a document sum to 1 and identify the proportion of \neach topic used in a document. For example, in Figure 26.4 , Document 1 consists of similar \nproportions for all three topics, Document 2 primarily consists of Topic 1, and Document \n3 primarily consists of Topic 2 and Topic 3. These topic proportions allow researchers to \ngain a better understanding of the essays and distinguish between them.\n26.3 Data Preprocessing, Estimation, and Postprocessing for LDA\nThis section provides an outline of the data cleaning and preprocessing, estimation, and \npostprocessing steps involved in LDA.\nFigure 26.3   An Example of the Topic Distribution over the Vocabulary.\nFigure 26.4   An Example of Topic Proportions for Documents. \n \n  \n\n--- Page 8 ---\nJordan M. Wheeler, Shiyu Wang, and Allan S. Cohen\n54226.3.1  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing\nBefore estimating an LDA model, the textual data goes through a set of data cleaning steps. \nThe objective of the data cleaning steps for LDA is to improve the quality and interpret -\nability of the model results ( Schofield et al., 2017 ). There are three major data cleaning \nsteps for LDA: tokenization, normalization (or lemmatization), and stopword removal.\nIt is important to note that LDA and its variants are considered “bag of words” models, \nmeaning that the order of the words is disregarded. While this may initially seem counter -\nintuitive, the objective of these models is to estimate topics and the semantic structure of the \ntext, which does not heavily rely on word order ( Blei, 2012 ). The bag of words assumption \nplays a crucial role in the data preprocessing steps of tokenization, normalization, and stop -\nword removal ( Boyd-  Graber et al., 2014 ).\n26.3.1.1  Tokenization\nIn the natural language processing and topic model literature, words are considered tokens. \nBefore tokenization, all punctuation is eliminated, and words are converted to lowercase to \nensure that the model doesn’t count the same word multiple times due to capitalization. For \nexample, the words “dunes” and “Dunes” should be considered as a single unique word \n(i.e., “dunes”). Tokenization involves splitting each document into its individual words, \nenabling the models to estimate the underlying topic structures ( Vijayarani & Janani, 2016 ).\n26.3.1.2  Normalization (Lemmatization)\nThe tokens undergo normalization through a process known as stemming or lemmatiza -\ntion. This involves retrieving the base form of a word by considering its different tenses \nor variations. For instance, the verbs “swim,” “swims,” “swimming,” and “swam” all \nconvey similar meanings and can be reduced to a single word, “swim.” The same applies \nto nouns, such as “teen,” “teens,” “teenager,” and “teenagers,” which can be transformed \ninto the word “teen.” Stemming aims to enhance topic clarity by utilizing a single repre -\nsentative word, facilitating the clustering of words with similar meanings and improving \nthe interpretability of topics ( Schofield et al., 2017 ). Stemming also includes correcting \nmisspelled words. Although stemming is context-  dependent, several R packages, such as \nhunspell  (Ooms, 2017 ), tm (Feinerer, 2013 ), and SnowballC  (Bouchet-  Valat, 2014 ), can be \nused to assist in this process.\n26.3.1.3  Stopword Removal\nStopwords are commonly used words that contribute little information about the topics \n(Wilbur & Sirotkin, 1992 ). Stopwords tend to occur frequently, and if not eliminated, they \ncan dominate the latent topics, reducing their interpretability ( Choi et al., 2017 ). Typical \nstopwords include words like “the,” “a,” “are,” and “they.” While there is no universal \napproach for selecting and removing stopwords, various techniques exist. Customized \nrules allow researchers to create stopwords lists tailored to their specific corpus analysis \n(Schofield et al., 2017 ). The term frequency–  inverse document frequency (TF-  IDF) index \nis another method to select stopwords, which utilizes term frequencies to determine if a \nword is overly used ( Robertson, 2004 ). Additionally, the general stopwords rule combines  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n\n--- Page 9 ---\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation of Constructed Responses\n543statistical approaches with customization to define stopwords ( Schütze et al., 2008 ). \nPrevious research suggests that customized stopword lists are necessary when analyzing \nessays ( Choi et al., 2017 ).\n26.3.2  Estimation of Parameters\nEstimating the LDA topic model involves selecting hyperparameters for the prior \ndistributions and selecting the appropriate number of topics. This section provides details \nabout prior specifications, estimation algorithms, software options, and methods for model \nselection.\n26.3.2.1  Prior Specification\nThe LDA model incorporates two priors: the topic prior and the document (or topic pro -\nportion) prior. These priors capture beliefs about the concentration levels of words within \ntopics and topics within documents ( Blei & Lafferty, 2009 ). The topic prior reflects the \nbelief regarding word concentration within topics. A small topic prior suggests that words \nare predominantly associated with a single topic, indicating minimal overlap between \ntopics.\nConversely, a large topic prior implies that words are associated with multiple topics, \nindicating a more significant overlap between topics. Similarly, the document prior \nrepresents beliefs about the topic concentration within documents. A small document \nprior indicates that documents primarily consist of a single topic, with a high topic pro -\nportion for that specific topic. On the other hand, a large document prior suggests that \ndocuments encompass multiple topics, with topic proportions uniformly distributed \nacross all topics.\nWhen the hyperparameters for the topic and document priors are set to values less than \n1 (Topic Prior < 1; Document Prior < 1), it reflects a small prior. Consequently, topics pri -\nmarily consist of a few words, and document topic proportions predominantly involve a \nfew topics. Setting the hyperparameters to 1 (Topic Prior =   1; Document Prior =   1) corres -\nponds to a non-  informative prior. In this case, the data have a more significant influence on \ndetermining the topics and document topic proportions. When the hyperparameters for the \ntopic and document priors exceed 1 (Topic Prior > 1; Document Prior > 1), it indicates a \nlarge prior. As a result, topics include words evenly from the entire vocabulary, and docu -\nment topic proportions are uniformly spread across all topics.\nSelecting appropriate values for the prior hyperparameters is crucial, although there \ncurrently needs to be more consensus in the literature regarding selection criteria ( Kwak, \n2019 ). Furthermore, minimal theoretical research has been conducted to investigate the \noptimal method for choosing prior hyperparameter values ( Thomas et al., 2014 ). Wheeler \net al. (2022c)  demonstrated that smaller prior hyperparameters yield better model selection \nin various educational measurement scenarios. Blei et al. (2003)  and Griffiths and Steyvers \n(2004)  suggest using prior hyperparameters of 200 /V for the topic prior and 50 /K for \nthe document prior, where V is the number of words in the vocabulary and K is the \nnumber of topics. It is worth noting since there has been little research on prior specifica -\ntion, especially in educational and psychological settings, it is important to investigate how \nthe change in prior hyperparameters affects the results and interpretation of the model as it \nwill provide evidence for construct validity. \n  \n \n  \n  \n\n--- Page 10 ---\nJordan M. Wheeler, Shiyu Wang, and Allan S. Cohen\n54426.3.2.2  Estimation Algorithm and Software\nThere exist several Bayesian estimation techniques for estimating the parameters, but the \ntwo most utilized methods are variational inference using expectation-  maximization and \nGibbs sampling. Variational inference is an efficient estimation approach, although it can be \nchallenging to implement and may become trapped at local maxima ( Blei et al., 2003 ). On \nthe other hand, Gibbs sampling algorithms are intuitive and easy to implement; however, \nthey may be slow in estimation, and assessing convergence can be difficult. Griffiths and \nSteyvers (2004)  presented a collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for LDA that integrates \nout the topics and topic proportions from the posterior distribution, focusing solely on \nestimating the topic assignments of each word. The topics and topic proportions are then \nanalytically derived from the estimated topic assignments.\nIn a simulation study conducted by Mardones et al. (2022) , the performance of these \nthree estimation algorithms was investigated. The study specifically examined conditions \ncommonly encountered in educational measurement settings, such as a small number of \ndocuments, short document lengths, and a limited number of topics. The findings revealed \nthat, in most conditions, the Gibbs sampling algorithm exhibited greater accuracy in \nrecovering the LDA parameters compared to variational inference. This study suggests that \nGibbs sampling algorithms should be favored over variational inference for educational \nsettings ( Mardones et al., 2022 ).\nEstimating a topic model is currently done by selecting the best fitting of different can -\ndidate models. Most estimation packages currently are written in R ( 2013 ) or Python. \nThe topicmodels  package ( Hornik & Grün, 2011 ) and the lda package ( Chang, 2012 ) \nare packages used in R and the sklearn  package ( Pedregosa et al., 2011 ) and the genism  \npackage ( Rehurek & Sojka, 2011 ) are packages used in Python.\n26.3.2.3  Model Selection\nLDA and sLDA models are commonly employed in an exploratory manner, where various \ncandidate models with different numbers of topics are compared to determine the best \nfit and interpretability. Several methods can be used to evaluate the fit of these candi -\ndate models. Since LDA and sLDA models can be estimated using Bayesian inference, one \nindex commonly used for model comparison is the deviance information criterion (DIC; \nSpiegelhalter et al., 2002 ). The DIC consists of two components: the deviance term, which \nmeasures the log-  likelihood, and the penalty term, which accounts for the number of \nestimated parameters. Similar to other information criterion indices, the model with the \nsmallest DIC is considered the best fitting. If two models have similar DIC values, the one \nwith fewer topics is typically preferred.\nAnother approach to model selection involves considering results from downstream \ntasks, such as regression or measures of classification accuracy ( Blei et al., 2003 ). The \nnumber of topics that leads to a more parsimonious model is usually selected as the best \nfitting model. In educational research, the number of topics tends to be small, especially for \nextended-  response items, due to the essay lengths and the influence of the prompts on the \nwords and topics used in the responses ( Choi et al., 2017 ; Xiong et al., 2021).\nIn a comprehensive study, Mardones et al. (2023)  conducted a simulation that \ninvestigated the accuracy of several model selection methods for LDA. The results indicated \nthat the Jensen–  Shannon Divergence and the sample adjusted Bayesian information criterion  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 11 ---\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation of Constructed Responses\n545(SABIC; Sclove, 1987 ) metrics outperformed other methods in selecting the appropriate \nnumber of topics across different educational measurement scenarios. It is worth noting \nthat in educational measurement settings, the selection of the number of topics should also \ntake into account the validity, interpretability, and fairness of the results ( Wheeler et al., \n2022a ).\n26.3.3  Postprocessing and Model Interpretation\nOnce the best-  fitting LDA topic model has been estimated and selected, the next step is to \nanalyze and interpret the results. There are various methods available for interpreting the \noutcomes of the LDA model, which include examining the topic structures and the topic \nproportions associated with each essay. The topic structures can be assessed and interpreted \nby examining the words that are clustered around each topic. This is typically accomplished \nby identifying the words with the highest probabilities of occurrence for each topic, such \nas the top 25 words with the largest estimated probabilities. Alongside examining the top \nwords for each topic, it is also beneficial to analyze a subset of essays that exhibit the \nhighest utilization of each topic. This additional analysis helps provide insights into how \nthe topics are being used and manifested within essays.\nThe topic proportions can be assessed and interpreted by looking at how the use of \ndifferent topics differs among essays (and thus students). The interpretation of topic \nproportions often involves using the interpretation of the topic structures and how the \ntopic proportions relate to other external variables, such as scores. For example, correlation \nanalyses can be conducted to see if there is a relationship between topic usage and score. \nAdditionally, clustering analyses are also common to see how closely related essays are, \nwhich can provide insight into the differences between essays.\n26.4 LDA Example\nIn this section, an example of applying LDA is provided using empirical essay data collected \nfrom an extended-  response item on an educational assessment.\n26.4.1  Essay Data\nThe essay data used in this example was taken from a ninth-  grade English Language Arts \n(ELA) formative assessment from a southeastern state. The formative assessment consisted \nof 20 selected response items and 2–  3 constructed response items, with one of them being \nan extended response item. For this example, the extended response item was used. The \nextended response item was categorized as an opinionated/  argumentative essay with the \nprompt presented in Figure 26.5 .\nThe extended-  response essay was evaluated by trained raters and assigned an integer \nscore ranging from 0 to 7, where 0 represents the lowest score and 7 indicates the highest \nscore achievable. A total of 3,815 essays were evaluated and a total of 3,707 essays \nwere used to fit an LDA topic model (108 essays out of the 3,815 essays were blank and \nthus removed from the LDA model). Across the 3,707 essays, the total word count was \n1,187,835, with 4,318 unique words observed. On average, each essay consisted of 320.43 \nwords and received an average score of 4.16. \n \n  \n  \n\n--- Page 12 ---\nJordan M. Wheeler, Shiyu Wang, and Allan S. Cohen\n54626.4.2  Data Cleaning\nThe initial set of 3,707 essays underwent various data cleaning and preprocessing steps \nas described earlier. These steps encompass tokenization, normalization, and removal of \nstopwords. Figure 26.6  displays the list of stopwords utilized in this particular example. \nFollowing the application of these data-  cleaning steps, the revised sample comprised 3,698 \nessays, with nine essays being excluded due to empty responses after the cleaning pro -\ncess. Across these 3,698 essays, the cumulative word count amounted to 689,666 words, \nencompassing 3,607 unique words. Furthermore, the average length of the essays in this \nupdated sample was 186.50 words.\n26.4.3  Model Estimation and Selection\nIn this particular example, a total of seven candidate models were estimated and compared. \nThese models encompassed a range from a two-  topic LDA model to an eight-  topic LDA \nmodel. During estimation, each model utilized prior hyperparameters ν=1 and η=1 . The \nestimation of the LDA models was performed using the collapsed Gibbs sampling algo -\nrithm implemented by the R package topicmodels . To assess and compare the models, the \nDIC was calculated for each of the seven candidate models. The results of the DIC com -\nparison are depicted in Figure 26.7 . Based on the results from Figure 26.7 , there seems to \nbe an initial break in DIC values at the five-  topic LDA model; therefore, the results in this \nexample will focus on the five-  topic LDA model.\n26.4.4  Interpreting LDA Results\nTable 26.1  presents the 25 words with the highest probabilities for each of the five topics. \nBy examining the words presented in Table 26.1 , along with an analysis of a subset of \nessays that predominantly utilized each topic, the following findings were inferred: Topic 1 \nis related to the negative effects of social networking on teens, specifically relating to fraud, \nsuch as identity theft and personal information theft. Topic 2 is also related to the nega -\ntive effects of social networking on teens, specifically relating to the social and emotional \nFigure 26.6   List of Stopwords Used for the Ninth-  Grade ELA Argumentative Extended-  Response \nEssays.\nFigure 26.5   Ninth-  Grade ELA Argumentative Prompt for Extended-  Response Essays. \n  \n \n  \n\n--- Page 13 ---\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation of Constructed Responses\n547impacts, such as bullying. Topic 3 is related to the positive effects of social networking on \nteens, specifically relating to interpersonal benefits, such as relationships and connecting \nto one another. Topic 4 is related to the positive effects of social networking on teens, spe -\ncifically relating to intrapersonal benefits, such as personal learning. Topic 5 is everyday \nlanguage.\nIt is important to note that looking at the top 25 words with the high probabilities for \neach topic is not always sufficient for interpreting the results from the LDA model. For \ninstance, when the vocabulary is large (i.e., there are many unique words in the corpus), \nthe probabilities can look quite small. To adjust for this, researchers can calculate the mag -\nnitude of word probabilities compared to a uniform distribution over the vocabulary. For \nexample, based on Table 26.1 , the word “information” is the top word in Topic 1 with a \nprobability of 0.061. Without context, this could appear to be quite small, however, since \nthere are 3,607 unique words in the vocabulary, the researcher can calculate how much \ngreater 0.061 is than a uniform distribution of the vocabulary (i.e., 1/  3607 =   0.0003). \nIn this case, the researcher would find that 0.061 is about 203 times greater than 0.0003 \n(0.061/  0.0003), which shows a relative magnitude of the word “information” in the con -\ntext of this data.\nIt is also important to note that it is beneficial to investigate subsets of essays that \npredominantly use each topic. For this example, the researchers could read a couple of \nessays that primarily use Topic 1, a couple of essays that primarily use Topic 2, and so \non. This sort of analysis helps the researchers better identify how each topic is being used \nin practice and lends itself to a clearer interpretation of the results obtained from the \nLDA model.\n26.4.5  Note on Generalized LDA Code\nIn order to provide readers with the opportunity to fit their own LDA model, generalized \nR and Python codes are provided in Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively. The R code \nutilizes the topicmodels  package and the Python code utilizes the gensim  library.\nFigure 26.7   DIC Values for the Seven Candidate LDA Topic Models. \n  \n\n--- Page 14 ---\nJordan M.

One significant challenge is determining the optimal number of topics \nthat yield the most meaningful and interpretable results. As previously mentioned, this is \na non-  trivial problem, and while fit indices can provide some guidance, there is currently \nno definitive statistic or established process for selecting the appropriate number of topics. \nAlong with determining the number of topics, it is important to better understand the effect \nof prior specification on the results obtained from LDA. The issues related to the number \nof topics and prior specifications affect the results and interpretations of LDA, which in \nturn affect construct validity. There have been few studies that have investigated methods \nfor assessing construct validity and invariance with LDA in educational and psychological \ncontexts. Addressing these issues should provide more utility and generalizability for evalu -\nating essays using LDA.\nCertain studies have started to establish connections between topic model analysis and \ninstructional outcomes (e.g., Duong et al., 2019 ; Kim et al., 2017 ; Kwak et al., 2017a ; \nXiong et al., 2022). More research, however, is needed to establish stronger links between \nthe measurement of underlying constructs and the practical utilization of LDA results \nwithin educational settings. Additionally, investigating how changes in topic usage over \ntime can be reflective of instructional effects, as demonstrated by research conducted by \nSouthavilay et al. (2013) , would be valuable.\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial to explore approaches for designing targeted \nquestions that elicit specific topics, enabling a more confirmatory approach to topic mod -\neling. This research endeavor would contribute to the advancement of topic models as a \nvaluable tool in educational measurement.\nReferences\nBlei, D. M. (2012). Probabilistic topic models.

INTRODUCTION\nLegal research has long been a shadow skill within the legal cur-\nriculum. Even as other skills began to take their prominence in law\nschools across the country in the wake of MacCrate and other reports\nthat advocated the importance of practical lawyering skills,' research is\noften treated as a topic less vital to students' professional success than\nmost others. This is due, at least in part, to false narratives that exist\nconcerning how interesting, hard, and important legal research is-or,\nmore critically, is not.\nThese false narratives exist due to any number of reasons, but\ntheir prevalence is detrimental to law students given the significant role\nlegal research instruction should play in their law school careers and\nwill play in their work as legal professionals. Unfortunately, these mis-\nconceptions surrounding legal research are expounded not only by\nword of mouth, but by the structure and assignments given in many\nfirst-year legal skills programs across the country, as well as the cog-\nnitive limits that students have. These false perceptions can have a\nnegative impact on students' attention to the material, which ultimately\nleads to a lack of retention of these skills. With small changes to the\nfirst-year skills curriculum, instructors can help students expand their\ncognitive capacities, strengthen student learning, and overcome these\nfalse narratives.\nPart II of this Article will explore three of the primary false nar-\nratives that affect students' perceptions of legal research instruction\nand explains why these false narratives are detrimental to students who\naccept them as true. Part III will look at how cognitive load, and the\ninstructional choices instructors make to help our students overcome\ntheir limited working memories, reinforces these false narratives. Part\nIII will also describe how professors can use scaffolding techniques to\nhelp overcome the challenges of students' limited cognitive capacity.\nPart IV will introduce a newly designed research log using the CREAC\n1. See generally Alyson M. Drake, The Needfor Experiential Legal Research\nEducation, 108 L. LIBR. J. 511, 512 (2016) (explaining that new attorneys entering\ninto the legal profession lack the practical skills necessary to act like practicing attor-\nneys).58 Vol. 52\n\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nBuilding on CREAC\nstructure commonly used in legal writing.2 Part IV will also demon-\nstrate how legal research professors can utilize the CREAC log as a\nscaffolding tool to help overcome these three false narratives and en-\nsure students gain the analytical research skills they need.\nI. FALSE NARRATIVES ABOUT LEGAL RESEARCH\nSome law students begin their legal education with false percep-\ntions about legal research. These may be due to several factors-word\nof mouth, the legal research class being pass/fail when all other courses\nare graded, having performed research previously in their past educa-\ntion, and more. Three common false narratives surrounding legal re-\nsearch are that legal research is easy, boring, and unimportant. Ulti-\nmately, these narratives can cause students to give less time and\nattention to the material and skills they are learning in legal research\nclass; those hiring new attorneys report that this lack of attention con-\ntributes to the lack of retention of legal research skills.3 The three fic-\ntionalized examples below, which are based on amalgamations of stu-\ndents over ten years of teaching, illustrate how these false narratives\nare formed and the impact of holding these false narratives.\nA. \"Legal Research Is Easy.\"\nAntoine is entering the first year of law school after obtaining a\nMaster's degree in political science from a prestigious university. He\nis looking forward to beginning his new degree program and suspects\nthat his previous experience as a graduate student will give him a leg\nup over his law school classmates. Antoine believes legal research is\neasy and probably does not necessitate multiple class sessions.\nAntoine's misconceptions arise from the fact that he did a great\ndeal of social sciences research in meeting the requirements for his un-\ndergraduate and graduate degrees. While he gained experience using a\n2. CREAC is a paradigm used to help students with legal analysis, often used\nin legal writing to help students learn to structure their legal memos and briefs. Diane\nB. Kraft, CREAC in the Real World, 63 CLEv. ST. L. REv. 567, 567 (2015).\n3. See ACAD. L. LIBRS. SPECIAL INT. SECTION TASK FORCE, A STUDY OF\nATTORNEYS' LEGAL RESEARCH PRACTICES AND OPINIONS OF NEW ASSOCIATES'\nRESEARCH SKILLS (2013), https://www.aallnet.org/allsis/wp-content/up-\nloads/sites/4/2018/01/finalreport_07102013.pdf.59 2021\n\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nThe University of Memphis Law Review\nfew select specialized databases, such as JSTOR and Ebsco, as he com-\npleted his Master's degree, he does not have any experience using the\nmajor legal databases. He is unaware that legal research has idiosyn-\ncrasies and challenges that differ from those he encountered while con-\nducting research for his other degrees. Like many law students, An-\ntoine likely classifies research as solely a rote, finding task that uses\ntechnology to locate sources that might be helpful for his research is-\nsues. He believes that once he can figure out how to navigate through\nthe pertinent databases-surely a simple task given his prior experience\nusing research databases-he will have learned everything he needs to\nknow about legal research.\nStudents like Antoine do not understand that the challenge in-\nherent to legal research is not in the gathering of sources, but in the\nlegal analysis researchers should do during the research process. There\nare a number of research tasks unique to the law that are inherently\nanalytical, including, but not limited to, synthesizing legal rules from\nmultiple sources, analogizing the rules found to the client fact patterns\nto determine a case's usefulness, and unpacking the court's reasoning\nto determine how those rules might be applied to the client's situation.4\nIt is doing this analytical work while effectively navigating to relevant\nsources that makes legal research the challenging task it is, even for\nthose students with prior experience doing comprehensive, in-depth re-\nsearch projects. Legal research instruction is so much more than just\nlearning to navigate a pair of databases. These students need a thought-\nfully designed legal research curriculum to help them understand the\nrole analysis plays in research. Making the role of analysis visible to\nour students is critical to garnering students' attention in the legal re-\nsearch classroom, which will play a key role in whether they ultimately\nretain the skills they are learning.5\nLegal research professors must have explicit conversations with\ntheir students about the role analysis plays in legal research.6\n4.

See generally JAMES LANG, DISTRACTED: WHY STUDENTS CAN'T Focus\nAND WHAT You CAN Do ABOUT IT (2020).\n6. Alyson Drake, Using the \"A\" Word in Legal Research Instruction,\nDIPLAWMATIC DIALOGUES (Feb. 20, 2018), https://fcilsis.word-\npress.com/2018/02/20/using-the-a-word-in-legal-research-instruction/.60 Vol. 52\n\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nBuilding on CREAC\nOtherwise, many students erroneously believe that analysis belongs\nsolely in the writing stage of the legal research and writing process.\nCorrecting this misconception early in students' law school careers is\nespecially important given that this misconception is often reinforced\nby both the structure of the first-year skills curriculum and the assign-\nments given in those classes.7 Unfortunately, this false impression is\nsometimes reinforced by doctrinal and other skills professors. These\nprofessors likely never had the analytical side of research emphasized\nduring their own legal education and see legal research as a skill set\ndevoid of analysis. For students like Antoine, it is important that in-\nstructors use instructional strategies such as scaffolding to emphasize\nthe analytical aspects of research in the overcrowded first year skills\ncurriculum.8\nB. \"Legal Research Is Boring.\"\nMaria is a first-year law student who came to law school because\nshe believes her calling is to help the less fortunate-those without a\nvoice-stand up for their rights. While Maria is smart and excited\nabout law school, she is unenthusiastic when she sees that she has mul-\ntiple class periods devoted to learning legal research as part of her first-\nyear skills course.\nShe enters the legal research classroom with the impression that\nlegal research is a less-than-thrilling activity that she must suffer\nthrough to reach the more exciting aspects of the legal profession-like\nstanding up and passionately advocating for those who need help in\ncourt. While a strong student, Maria believes legal research is just\n\"finding stuff' and assumes that she will have a paralegal whose main\nfunction will be doing her research for her. She wishes that she could\nspend more time in the first semester honing her oral advocacy skills\ninstead of learning to look up cases and statutes on her computer-isn't\nthat what Google is for?\n7. See infra Part II.B.\n8. Scaffolding is a teaching method in which teachers offer a particular sup-\nport or framework to aid students as they learn or master a new skill. See Content\nScaffolding, IRIS CTR. https://iris.peabody.vanderbilt.edu/module/sca/cre-\nsource/q2/p03/#content (last visited Dec. 30, 2021). For more on scaffolding, see in-\nfra notes 77-101 & accompanying text.61 2021\n\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nThe University of Memphis Law Review\nMaria is not alone. Many first-year law students enter legal re-\nsearch classrooms, whether a stand-alone research course or a compo-\nnent of a larger legal research and writing class, wondering why so\nmuch time is spent on research, a skill they may consider boring. Per-\nceived boredom can be severely detrimental to student learning.9 As\nJames Lang argues in Distracted: Why Students Can't Focus and What\nto Do About It, students will not retain anything that they're not paying\nattention to.10 However, research becomes less boring and we are bet-\nter able to maintain student attention when the professor can tie the\nlearning back to the students' own personal reasons for being in law\nschool.\" As Kevin Michael Klipfel and Dani Brecher Cook note in\ntheir 2017 book, Learner-Centered Pedagogy: Principles and Prac-\ntice, \"significant learning takes place for the learner if, and only if, the\nlearner attaches some personal meaning to the subject of inquiry and\nwants to learn about the subject matter. Real, genuine curiosity is cen-\ntral to this kind of learning.\"1 2\nThe additional problem with this false narrative is it results in\nstudents entering our classrooms with primarily extrinsic motivation.\nExtrinsic motivation occurs when students are motivated by an outside\nreward or punishment.13 Students who grasp on to this narrative may\nbe motivated solely by the grades they will receive on research assign-\nments or by the participation points they might lose if they do not show\nup to class ready to engage with the material.4 Intrinsic motivation,\non the other hand, occurs when students are interested in the material\n\"for its own sake.\"5\n9.

As students begin this new educational experience, it becomes\nan easy choice for students to de-prioritize legal research as they at-\ntempt to handle the tremendous cognitive load the first year of law\nschool presents to them.\nA. What is Cognitive Load?\nCognitive psychologists use the term cognitive load to describe\nthe mental challenge working memory imposes on a person's learn-\ning.30 As cognitive psychologist Frederick Reif described it, \"[t]he\ncognitive load involved in a task is the cognitive effort (or amount of\ninformation processing) required by a person to perform this task.\"31\nDeveloped by John Sweller, cognitive load theory, in its simplest form,\nexplains that working memory has a limited capacity and that instruc-\ntional methods should avoid adding to that burden by including activi-\nties that do not directly contribute to student learning.32 In other words,\ncognitive load theorists argue that learning complex, new information\n29.

Cognitive load is based on a model\nof human information processing that divides memory into three\ntypes.34 The first type is sensory memory.5 As humans move through\nthe world, they get sensory impressions of everything surrounding\nthem. Sensory memory processes those bits of sensory information\nthat are important enough-usually things that surprise us or that we\nare actively paying attention to-to pass into working memory.36\nOnce sensory memory passes into working memory, the infor-\nmation is either processed or discarded.37 Working memory is the\n\"limited mental 'space' in which humans think;\"38 we are only con-\nscious of information processing during this stage of memory.39 Hu-\nmans are only able to hold on to between five and nine \"chunks\" of\ninformation at any given time.40 Psychologist George A. Miller intro-\nduced the term chunk in his research on short-term memory, describing\nchunks as groups of items collected together and treated by the brain as\na single unit.41 What constitutes a chunk of information will differ\nbased on the strength of the knowledge structures in someone's long-\n33.

In contrast, for a\nnovice learner without a knowledge structure into which she can fit the\nnew concepts she 's learning, each new concept may be its own chunk.43\nFurthermore, working memory is limited in its duration when\nprocessing new information; most information stored in working\nmemory vanishes within thirty seconds if not rehearsed.44 Cognitive\nload theory, moreover, is concerned primarily with the limits of work-\ning memory. While a person is learning, information must be held in\none's working memory.4' As such, when too much information is pre-\nsented, the learner's cognitive capacity is overloaded and much of the\nnew information is lost.46\nFinally, working memory that is not discarded is processed and\ncategorized in the brain into long-term memory.47 Long-term memory\nis \"stored in knowledge structures called schemas,\" which organize in-\nformation according to how people use it.48 Long-term memory is con-\nsidered to be infinite, but the more practiced a person is at using any\ngiven scheme, the more effortless that behavior becomes.49 This pro-\ncess is called automation.50 The aim of learning is to move new infor-\nmation to long-term memory so that students can then draw on this\n42.

The first is to reduce those ineffective instruc-\ntional design choices that lead to extraneous cognitive load.63 The\nother, which this Article concerns, is to design their course-wherever\npossible-relying on preexisting schemas in students' long-term\nmemory.64 These preexisting schema are any information that has\nmoved into one's long-term memory, including any concepts or skills\ngained in students' life experience or earlier in their educational ca-\nreers.65 When students are learning new things, they retrieve schema\nfrom their long-term memory and move them into their working\nmemory.66 Luckily, working memory treats already-established\nschema as a single chunk of information, rather than the separate pieces\nthat went into building that knowledge structure.67\nIn fact, those schema that have been retrieved and used repeat-\nedly barely register in the working memory as a chunk of information\nbecause schema are so deeply ingrained in the long-term memory.68 As\na result, learning activities that rely upon a learner's existing\nknowledge structures actually expand the capacity of one's working\nmemory, and the cognitive load is reduced.69 That is, \"we can reduce\nthe demands on our processing power-or the cognitive load of a prob-\nlem-by being able to draw upon concepts that we have stored in our\nlong-term memory.\"70\n61.

Research Instruction and Cognitive Load in First-Year Legal\nSkills Instruction\nThe limits of first-year law students' working memories are con-\nstantly tested. Aside from the substantive content learned in classes,\nfirst-year law students are adjusting to a new place to live, learning new\nstudy strategies, forming new friendships, and managing financial\nstressors. Many first-generation and underrepresented minority law\nstudents likely also use cognitive space to question whether they belong\nin law school spaces that can feel like they were built for different\ngroups.71 Accordingly, first-year students are constantly processing in-\nformation from working memory to long-term memory. These stu-\ndents are also working to build knowledge structures in their doctrinal\nclasses; because most of the material they encounter is entirely new to\nthem, they lack sophisticated knowledge structures in their long-term\nmemory and their working memories are constantly at capacity trying\nto hold on to and process the new chunks of information continually\nintroduced.\nIn their first-year legal skills courses, students are trying to rec-\noncile the new substantive law they are learning with practical skills\nand analytical skills that also require a great deal of working memory.\nAs Professors Terri Enns and Monte Smith note, \"the complicated pro-\ncess of analyzing legal problems, researching their possible solutions,\nand communicating that analysis in writing can overwhelm students'\nworking memories, leaving no space for the conscious acquisition of\nmore broadly-applicable writing doctrine.\"72\nStudents struggle because they try to internalize large volumes\nof new information and perform new skills \"while being expected to\nperform as if they already have internalized them.\"73 This can be in-\ncredibly frustrating to students. Effective course design makes students\n71. Toni Schmader & Michael Johns, Converging Evidence That Stereotype\nThreat Reduces Working Memory Capacity, 85 J. PERSONALITY & Soc.

While students in first-year legal skills\ncourses are provided with a structure for tying together their analysis\nand writing,76 they do not usually receive any structure for how to con-\nduct analytical research. Because this overloading of the first-year\nskills curriculum causes so many challenges to learning, often profes-\nsors make a choice to emphasize other skills-writing, analysis, oral\nadvocacy, or most likely some combination of the three-above re-\nsearch. Courses are designed to emphasize these other important skills\nto the detriment of research skills-especially analytical research\nskills.\nAs such, in many first-year skills courses, the emphasis centers\non the bibliographical retrieval skills, minimizing the analysis. Often\nprofessors ground their research assignments in a fact pattern to give\nthe impression that students are engaging in experiential problem-solv-\ning. Unfortunately, due to class time constraints and a huge variety of\nsources to cover, the problems must be simple ones if students are go-\ning to complete their in-class exercises during class time.\nLikewise, in many cases, first-year open memo problems are\npurposely kept simple to allow students to focus on their writing and\norganizational skills. Problems may be based solely on common law,\ndepriving students of the opportunity to utilize their statutory research\nskills. Problems may also rely upon a very limited body of cases. In\nothers, the research problems may be challenging, but students have\nreceived little guidance in how to engage in research analysis or have\nhad little time to practice conducting research analysis while doing bib-\nliographic research. This results in students engaging in only a surface-\nlevel analysis, skimming to see if cases might seem helpful. This\n74. DIRKSEN, supra note 13, at 35.\n75. Id.\n76.

Unfortunately, while students in first-year legal\nskills courses are provided with a structure for tying together their anal-\nysis and writing, they do not usually receive any structure for how to\nconduct analytical research. Additionally, while most students imme-\ndiately see the importance of legal writing or oral advocacy, there is an\nadditional barrier to overcome with legal research: students' lack of\nintrinsic motivation due to the false narratives surrounding legal re-\nsearch instruction. This lack of intrinsic motivation, when tied to the\nlimited cognitive capacity of these students, means that students strug-\ngle immensely when the time comes to tie their bibliographic and ana-\nlytical research skills together. Providing students with a structure for\npracticing these two skills simultaneously will help them tremen-\ndously-particularly if first-year skills professors can reduce the bur-\nden on students' cognitive load by tying that structure to a structure\nstudents have already been introduced to while learning how to com-\nmunicate legal analysis in writing.\nIV. How SCAFFOLDING CAN HELP OVERCOME COGNITIVE\n(OVER)LOAD\nA. What is Scaffolding?\nWhen working to solve a problem, one must rely on their work-\ning memory.77 Researcher Richard Clark and his team aptly describe\nthe overcrowded, stream-of-conscious thought process that students\nexperience when learning new concepts and skills:\nIf the learner has no relevant concepts or procedures in\nlong-term memory, the only thing to do is blindly search\nfor possible solution steps that bridge the gap between\nthe problem and its solution. This process places a great\n77. Clark, Kirschner, & Sweller, supra note 36, at 10.72 Vol. 52\n\n\n--- Page 18 ---\nBuilding on CREAC\nburden on working-memory capacity because the prob-\nlem solver has to continually hold and process the current\nproblem state in working memory (e.g., Where am I right\nnow in the problem-solving process? How far have I\ncome toward fmding a solution?) along with the goal\nstate (e.g., Where do I have to go? What is the solution?),\nthe relations between the goal state and the problem state\n(e.g., Is this a good step toward solving the problem? Has\nwhat I've done helped me get nearer to where I need to\ngo?), the solution steps that could further reduce the dif-\nferences between two states (e.g., What should the next\nstep be? Will that step bring me closer to the solution?\nIs there another solution strategy I can use that might be\nbetter?), and any subgoals along the way.78\nThis is a tremendously difficult task for a novice learner. For this rea-\nson, professors need to adopt pedagogical strategies, such as scaffold-\ning, that will ease students' cognitive burden.\nScaffolding is one method for helping reduce intrinsic cognitive\nload. In instructional settings, scaffolding is defined as supports an in-\nstructor provides to boost student learning and to help students develop\nand master new content and skills.79 As one author described it,\n\"[g]ood scaffolding acts like training wheels; it allows learners to ac-\ncomplish the difficult task in a safely supported way. Ideally, it doesn't\nreduce learners to bystanders but gives them the support they need to\ncomplete tasks they otherwise wouldn't be able to do.\"8 0 That support\nshould be gradually reduced as learners become more competent to\nhandle learning on their own.81\nOne reason scaffolding is so effective is the consistency that\ncomes from using the same scaffolding structure over and over again.82\nOnce students learn the scaffolding structure the first time, they are not\nstarting from scratch the next time they encounter it.83 Instead, they\n78.

See id.73 2021\n\n\n--- Page 19 ---\nThe University of Memphis Law Review\ncan just pull the structure from their long-term memory as a single\nchunk.84 When an element of learning is consistent, then students do\nnot have to allocate mental resources to relearning it.85\nSecond, scaffolding gives students a context and a method to\nprocess what they are learning.86 It allows professors to build on stu-\ndents' preexisting knowledge base to teach fundamental concepts in a\nhelpful progression.87 It also helps students to increase and strengthen\nconnections between the pieces of information they are learning.88 The\ndifficulty of a learning experience is based on both the complexity of\nthe information being learned and the prior knowledge of the learner,\nso if professors can tie new learning to prior learning, it will help miti-\ngate some of the difficulty inherent to learning new content.89\nFinally, the structure that scaffolding provides students helps\nthem organize their learning.90 As Clark and his collaborators pre-\nsented in one of their hallmark articles on cognitive load theory:\nDecades of research clearly demonstrate thatfor novices\n(comprising virtually all students), direct, explicit in-\nstruction is more effective and more efficient than partial\nguidance. So, when teaching new content and skills to\nnovices, teachers are more effective when they provide\nexplicit guidance accompanied by practice and feedback,\nnot when they require students to discover many aspects\nof what they must learn.91\nScaffolding provides the guidance students need in processing\nnew information.92 By putting the scaffolding in place, the instructor\nhelps students make connections between knowledge the students have\n84.

Using a\ncombination of content and material scaffolding techniques to tie learn-\ning analytical legal research to something students are already familiar\nwith, such as the CREAC structure used to organize legal writing, will\nhelp reduce students' cognitive load and make it easier for them to\nlearn.\nB. Research Logs\nResearch logs are a research tool familiar to many legal research\ninstructors that can be easily adapted into a scaffolding aid that can help\nlaw students in developing their legal research analysis skills. By mod-\nifying research logs to follow an IRAC or CREAC structure, legal re-\nsearch instructors can tap into their students' pre-existing schema for\nlegal analysis and help students understand the central role that analysis\nplays in legal research.\n1. The Traditional Research Log\nResearch logs are not a new curricular tool for legal research\ncourses. Defined as a \"comprehensive list of the sources searched and\na summary of findings,\"102 research logs have traditionally been uti-\nlized as a record-or note-keeping tool.'03 Typically, researchers will\nuse a spreadsheet or chart to capture their research process in log form\nto stay organized while researching.104\nTraditional research logs generally include columns requiring\nsome mix of the following information: (1) the name of the resource\n101.

The findings column does not require\nthe researcher to critically analyze the source or to consider how they\nwill actually use that source in evaluating the legal issues in a client's\npending case. Nor does it require researchers to consider how the rules\nof a case might be applied to the client's issue or to compare the facts\nof the client's case to those in the cases they have located in their re-\nsearch. The traditional log only requires that the researcher read or,\nmore likely, skim the case to see if it \"seems\" like it may be relevant.\nUndoubtedly, the researcher will have to reread all these sources again\nlater to remember how she thought it was helpful and to confirm that it\nis actually useful to her client's issues.\nAs such, the traditional log suggests research is primarily about\nlocating sources, a technical skill rather than an analytical one.

The CREAC Log\nIn first-year legal skills courses, many legal writing faculty in-\ntroduce their students to some form of CREAC or IRAC as a way of\nhelping students understand how to structure their legal analysis.1 19\nThe CREAC abbreviation stands for \"Conclusion, Rule, Explanation,\nApplication, and Conclusion.\"120 The IRAC abbreviation begins with\n117.

For the closed memo, professors hand stu-\ndents a case file with a limited number of cases, perhaps accompanied\nby a statute and/or a secondary source and ask students to engage in\nlegal analysis and writing without having to first struggle with finding\ncases and analyzing their relevance to their client's issues.2' Through\nthis process, students are taught that only analysis and writing are in-\ntertwined.

This instruction traditionally focuses on\ndemonstrating the bibliographic tasks used to locate various sources. It\nthen utilizes practice exercises that allow students to find sources,\nsometimes with a hypothetical to give them context for the issue. In\nthis format, research is kept largely separate from analysis-or at least\nit is not explicitly discussed as an analytical exercise. Students may\nanswer a legal question, but due to time constraints, the hypotheticals\nare necessarily kept on the simpler side and students are not forced to\nstruggle with in-depth legal analysis.\nOnce students have practiced researching cases and statutes (and\nsometimes secondary sources and regulations), they begin researching\nan open memo problem that asks them to tie together their newly ac-\nquired research, analysis, and writing skills. Unfortunately, due to the\nextreme cognitive burden that first-year law students are under, tying\nthese separately taught skills together proves to be a challenging task\nfor most students. This occurs, in large part, because law students have\nnever engaged in complex legal analysis while researching. Their total\nexperience in analysis has come after they have been handed a pile of\nsources, so they lack the framework necessary to tackle bibliographic\nresearch and research analysis as a unified process.\nAs a result, most students engage primarily in bibliographic re-\nsearch with, at most, a shallow level of analysis. Most students attempt\nto find cases that \"seem\" on point due to having similar facts, collect\nthose in a folder, and then begin to engage deeply in legal analysis only\nonce they perceive they are done researching and ready to begin writ-\ning. When conducting legal research in this manner, most students\nskim the cases while researching, perhaps going so far as to note issues\nor sub-issues the cases discuss. Students often fail to consider what\nrules emerge from each precedent, how those rules have been applied,\nand how they might apply to their own set of facts. With such a cursory\nreading, students must reread all their authorities when it comes time\nto conduct their full analysis-usually when it is time for them to begin\ndrafting their open memo.124 This less-than-ideal research method not\n124. In an anonymous student survey given to 2L and 3L students in an Ad-\nvanced Legal Research class, one student noted this propensity on earlier research\nprojects she had completed:\nIn the past, I have often just researched a bunch of cases, scanned\nthem quickly and saved them to a Westlaw folder .... I always\nthought I'd miraculously remember all the details. Obviously2021 81\n\n\n--- Page 27 ---\nThe University of Memphis Law Review\nonly requires students to waste time rereading when they are ready to\nstart writing their memos or briefs, but it also reinforces the narratives\nof legal research as a mechanical task. In effect, students are trying to\nrecreate the packet they were handed for their closed memo, and it re-\ninforces the idea that they cannot start analyzing until after they have a\nset of sources. It is not, however, a productive use of students' time or\nenergy to merely find the law without analyzing it simultaneously.\nReimagining the research log as an educational tool, based on\nthe CREAC format, gives students a helpful framework for encounter-\ning the analytical side of research. Even though students are not experts\nin legal analysis after one closed memo, they are at least familiar with\nthe characteristics of how to engage in analysis based on CREAC, and\nit eases their way into performing research analysis.125 The CREAC\nstructure acts as the training wheels students need when doing analyti-\ncal research for the first time. It forces students to organize their re-\nsearch in an effective way and to engage in analysis while researching,\nserving as a scaffold for their learning. Introducing the CREAC log\nduring their first experiences with open legal research also helps stu-\ndents create habits to engage in analysis while researching rather than\nafter they are done researching.\nThe CREAC log follows a fairly simple structure and can be\nmodified as needed based on the professor's preferences or to match\nwhichever format (CREAC, IRAC, etc.) that the legal writing professor\nuses. At the top of each section of the log, students should identify the\nissue or sub-issue they are researching. For example, if students were\nresearching a burglary issue, they might have sub-issues for each of the\nindividual elements of burglary (see Appendix A). This serves to break\ndown students' research into manageable pieces rather than trying to\nthink about multiple complicated issues at once-helping to combat\ncognitive overload-and requires them to analyze the clients' fact\nwhen the time came for me to go back.and write a memo or sum-\nmarize my research, I'd quickly realized how unprepared I was. I\nwould essentially be back at square one!\nAnonymous student survey (on file with author).\n125. See Clark, Kirschner, & Sweller, supra note 36, at 9 (\"We are skillful in an\narea if our long-term memory contains huge amounts of information or knowledge\nconcerning the area. That information permits us to quickly recognize the character-\nistics of a situation and indicates to us, often immediately and unconsciously, what to\ndo and when to do it.\").82 Vol. 52\n\n\n--- Page 28 ---\nBuilding on CREAC\nscenario to identify the preliminary issues.126 Each issue or sub-issue\nthen has the following columns beneath it:\nCitation: Here, the researcher puts the citation to the source she\nis analyzing, including the pincite to the part of the source discussing\nthat issue. She might also describe how she found this source if that is\nhelpful to her in remembering which research strategies she has already\nused and which she might want to use when she next resumes her re-\nsearch. It is a good opportunity to explain to students that the first\nquestion they will be asked if they get stuck in their research and need\nto ask for help is what they have already tried-and that it is useful to\nkeep a record of what resources they have already consulted. Research\nprofessors may want to require that additional piece, so they can follow\ntheir students' research paths more easily to give effective feedback on\ntheir students' research processes.\nR(ule): Next, students identify the rule laid out in that case for\nthat particular issue or sub-issue. Students should not identify every\nrule laid out in the case. If a case concerns more than one of the issues\nstudents are researching, it would appear in the log under each of those\nissues. This allows students to keep their authorities for individual is-\nsues straight, which helps when they begin drafting. Learning to iden-\ntify the rule from a source is an important lawyering skill, so the\nCREAC log also reinforces skills that will be helpful in other courses.\nE(xplanation): Next, students explain how the rule they identi-\nfied was applied in the precedent case, including the reasoning the court\ngave for that application. This allows students to practice their analyt-\nical skills as they parse out how a rule was applied to the particular\nfacts of the precedent case and whether the court emphasized certain\npoints in applying that rule to the precedent case.27 For sources such\nas statutes or regulations, students would skip the explanation step, as\nthe rule has not been applied to facts in those resources.\n126. In surveying 2L and 3L students, the benefits of the log became very clear,\nas they were able to compare it to research they had done prior to being introduced to\nthe CREAC log. For example, one student noted: \"I came to appreciate how the\nresearch log can be extremely helpful in breaking down complex concepts and in an-\nalyzing various elements.\" Anonymous student survey results (on file with author).\n127. \"By requiring explanations and an application to the facts, I'm now able to\nsee exactly why I chose a specific case based on its rules and my understanding of\nhow it applies to the facts.\" Anonymous student survey results (on file with author).83 2021\n\n\n--- Page 29 ---\nThe University of Memphis Law Review\nA(pplication): Students will then suggest how the rule specific\nto that sub-issue would likely be applied to their precedent case for that\nissue. This is where students engage in their deepest analysis, as they\ncompare and contrast relevant facts of their clients' case against the\nfacts of the precedent cases and analogize how rules might be applied\nto their client's fact scenario based on those rules' application in the\nprecedent opinion.128\nNotes: In this section, researchers can jot down any notes or\nquestions they have after analyzing this source for this sub-issue. This\ncan include questions that arose while researching that they had not\npreviously considered. Because research is a circular process, re-\nsearchers cannot follow all leads from a single source simultaneously.\nAs such, students can also note other potentially helpful sources or rel-\nevant topic and key numbers they came across while reading this source\nand that they want to consult later.129  This column allows the re-\nsearcher to stay organized throughout the research process, like the tra-\nditional research log. It will also help them to keep a list of sources\nthey have already consulted, as they can strikethrough the sources they\nhave already looked at that were not helpful. Ultimately, having a list\nof all the sources they have read-whether they end up logging them\nor not-can help them to know when they are finished researching, as\n128. One student emphasized this point: \"[T]his method forced me to think\nabout why exactly the particular case would be useful ... rather than identifying the\ncases as one that generally seems to related based on the overall facts or law.\" Anon-\nymous student survey results (on file with author).\n129. In the anonymous student survey, one student noted: \"I greatly appreciate\nthis area of the log because it allows for creativity and is more open-ended... .It\nenables me to include ideas that [may] not be immediately relevant to the issue that I\nam presently analyzing.\" Anonymous student survey results (on file with author).\nAnother found that the Notes section gave them the space to think more openly about\ntheir research:\nThe CREAC log helped me organized my thoughts and posit ques-\ntions in an accessible way .... For example, I left a comment in\nthe statute entry asking whether the statute's mention of a 'class B\nfelony' was relevant in our cases. This was an off-handed question\nthat I thought to myself while reading through the statute. I appre-\nciate that the log gave me a space to mark this query to revisit. In\nmy previous research I might not have jotted down this question\nand I could have written it off as a non-issue.\nAnonymous student survey results (on file with author).84 Vol. 52\n\n\n--- Page 30 ---\nBuilding on CREAC\none clue to know when they are done researching is to see the same\nprecedent pop up again and again.\nFinally, after each sub-issue, there is a place for the researcher\nto conclude based on their analysis of the sources consulted for each\nissue. This allows students to engage in rule synthesis when appropri-\nate and to make a prediction about how the court is likely to rule on the\nparticular issue.\nBecause first-year students have already been introduced to\nCREAC earlier in the semester while completing their closed memo\nassignment, they have pre-existing knowledge structures in place to\nhelp them organize and engage in their analysis.1 30 In an anonymous\nsurvey we gave asking students to reflect on using the CREAC log,\nstudents noted both of these benefits. For example, one student noted:\nThe CREAC log is the latest tool that I will certainly take\nwith me into practice, for a number of reasons. First, as\ndescribed above, the way the CREAC log is structured\nnaturally led me to a deeper analysis of my cases and the\nkey facts and issues within. Just through the process, I\nbegan to see things in my cases I would not have other-\nwise picked up on. Second, it is a great way to stay or-\nganized. Breaking down the statutes by elements, and\nthen organizing my rules on each element in the CREAC\nlog helped me to keep each aspect of the case distinct and\nallows you to analyze each element and understand the\nstandards of proof, and burdens of proof, that are re-\nquired for each.131\nCREAC gives students a framework for how to engage with the\nsources they are encountering, rather than reading sources without a\nclear objective. Its structure serves as a reminder to look for rules, an-\nalyze how those rules were applied in their precedent, and consider how\nthat rule might be applied in their particular case.13' This is a better\n130. See supra Part III.A.\n131. Anonymous student survey results (on file with author).\n132. One student wrote in the anonymous student survey that:\nOutlining the specific elements of the case and providing quick rule\nstatements and analysis allowed me to always have an overview of\nthe case I was researching that was easy and simple to read, so that2021 85\n\n\n--- Page 31 ---\nThe University of Memphis Law Review\nstrategy than skimming a case to see if it seems generally on point and\nthrowing it in a pile with a bunch of other authorities to return to when\nit is time to start writing; the CREAC log prevents students from having\nto reread and only begin analyzing sources when it is time to write and\nfocus on drafting.1 33\nA wonderful side effect of this tool is that it generally results in\nbetter written memos, as students often struggle when they try to sim-\nultaneously analyze sources and draft using the mechanical writing\nskills they are still learning. The CREAC log can serve as a rough\noutline of their analysis, so when it is time to write, students can be\nmore elegant in structuring their arguments because they already have\na basic outline of the rules and their application. More practice with\nlegal analysis can also be a benefit when it comes time for students to\ntake their first-year exams; they will have had more practice utilizing\nCREAC to organize their answers.\nIt is critical that instructors be explicit about how and why stu-\ndents are conducting research using a log. Otherwise, students may see\nthe log as busy work. Explaining that the log is meant to serve as a\nstructure to help students with the analytical work of research will help\nstudents to see the value in the exercise. Talking to students about the\nlearning benefits of scaffolding lets them know that using research logs\nis a carefully designed instructional strategy meant to help them grow\nas future attorneys. It is also prudent to explain the helpful side effects\nof completing the log-serving as a rough draft for their memo, helping\nthem master the CREAC structure to thrive on their writing assign-\nments and exams, and ultimately saving them time in their research and\nwriting projects as they do not duplicate their analytical work.\nI could pick up my train of thought where it last let off when jump-\ning back on the research process.\nAnonymous student survey results (on file with author).\n133. This showed up in the anonymous student survey results as well, with one\nstudent mentioning that it's:\n[M]uch easier to have pre-written analysis of how the rulings in\nspecific cases relate to the matter you are researching than having\nto go back to a case you only have a citation for and trying to re-\nmember why you marked it down as useful for this issue in the first\nplace.\nAnonymous student survey results (on file with author).86 Vol. 52\n\n\n--- Page 32 ---\nBuilding on CREAC\nStudents may think it is not practical to do a complete research\nlog every time they conduct legal research-and they are correct. But\nutilizing the CREAC log during the time we are teaching students to\nengage in research analysis will train them to engage in those mental\nprocesses later in their careers without the aid of the log itself. A key\npart of scaffolding, after all, is eventually to remove those training\nwheels. As students move away from their legal skills courses, stu-\ndents' long-term memories will already have knowledge constructs\nformed to engage in analysis during research. Students, therefore, will\nimmediately and unconsciously begin to engage in this analysis while\nresearching even without the CREAC log's structure to aid them. Oth-\ners may return to the research log throughout their career when they are\njuggling multiple complex cases to keep their research organized.34\n3. How a New Log Overcomes False Narratives\nIn addition to providing students with a knowledge structure to\nhelp them engage in analytical and bibliographic research simultane-\nously, forcing students to engage in legal analysis also helps to correct\nthe three false narratives of legal research that students hold-that legal\nresearch is easy, boring, and unimportant.3' The primary reason for\nthis is that requiring students to engage in legal analysis eliminates the\nperception that research is solely a mechanical gathering task.136\nFor the students like Antoine who believe that legal research is\neasy, engaging in this analysis demonstrates that legal research is a\ncomplex undertaking. It shows students that legal research is not just\nabout finding cases that are factually similar but requires deep thinking\nabout how the rules as applied in precedent cases would be addressed\n134. Several students in the anonymous student survey explicitly stated that they\nintended to use the logs in practice and showed a thoughtfulness of how they could\nadapt it based on the type of research they were doing. Id.\n135. See supra Part II.\n136. The anonymous student survey results show that the students are thinking\nmore deeply about the researching that they're doing. One student stated that: \"the\ndifference in results between [using the log or not] is stark. My thoughts on my re-\nsearch and much clearer once they are organized into the log.\" Anonymous student\nsurvey results (on file with author). Another student echoed that sentiment: \"[The\nCREAC log] helped my thinking and analysis when evaluating a statute or a case ...\n.[It] helped deepen my analysis of the law.\" Id.2021 87\n\n\n--- Page 33 ---\nThe University of Memphis Law Review\nin their client's situation. He will learn that there is much more to legal\nresearch than figuring out how to navigate Westlaw and Lexis.\nFor the Marias, who believe that legal research is boring, the\nCREAC log will help them see that research is, at its heart, a problem-\nsolving endeavor. They will learn that research is a chance to find the\nanswers to their clients' problems. By highlighting research's relation-\nship to the analysis and writing processes, legal skills professors can\nhelp increase these students' intrinsic motivation and maintain their at-\ntention, as they see research as central to their ability to help their cli-\nents. These increases in intrinsic motivation and attention will ulti-\nmately result in better long-term retention of these skills. Students will\nalso leave class understanding that research requires in-depth analysis\nand serious problem-solving chops.\nFinally, the CREAC log can show the Andys, who believe that\nresearch is unimportant, how central legal research is to lawyering.\nWhile research may be worth fewer credits or a smaller percentage of\ntheir first-year skills course grade, the analysis skills they practice\nwhile using the CREAC log will be helpful for their doctrinal classes.\nThey will see how critical research is for successful writing and that\ntheir analytical research abilities will have an impact on their writing\ngrades.'37\nThe CREAC log reduces the burden on students' cognitive\nloads, integrates research more clearly into analysis and the writing\nprocess, increases students' intrinsic motivation for engaging in legal\nresearch, and can have positive impacts on students' final exams and\ntheir writing projects-all while battling the false narratives that deni-\ngrate research's place in the legal curriculum.\nV. CONCLUSION\nThe overcrowding of the first-year curriculum is challenging for\nstudents' limited cognitive capacities. Due to this problem, research\ninstruction has been focused on bibliographic, rather than analytical,\nskills. This lack of emphasis on research as analysis has resulted in\nfalse narratives about the importance and difficulty of legal research\n137. Additionally, because students are engaging in significant analysis while\ncompleting the log, legal skills faculty can attribute more of their overall grade to\nresearch, emphasizing its importance in the course, particularly if the log can serve as\nan outline for their memo drafts.88 Vol. 52\n\n\n--- Page 34 ---\n2021 Building on CREAC 89\ninstruction and reduced students' intrinsic motivation for learning re-\nsearch skills. It has also made it challenging for students to engage in\ncomplex legal analysis while researching, a necessary skill for the effi-\ncient practice of law.\nResearch professors can look to educational psychologists' re-\nsearch on cognitive load theory and scaffolding to aid them in rede-\nsigning their courses and assignments by drawing on preexisting\nknowledge structures that have been introduced in earlier educational\nexperiences. The CREAC log is one example of a scaffolding tech-\nnique professors can use to help law students engage in legal analysis\nwhile researching. Not only will this result in students maintaining\nstronger research and analysis skills, it will help break down damaging\nfalse narratives about the importance of legal research within the legal\nacademy as students learn to engage simultaneously in bibliographic\nand analytical research.\n\n\n--- Page 35 ---\nThe University of Memphis Law Review\no Qd\nca00\na )Vol. 52\nU\n4)\nU,\n'C4 N ) U,\n0\nbi CSa) i\n`. mo o ° $d Ua~ r.\nt- *f c \n)\nU o c ° Qn ' b )\nc ~ ~ ,\ny b 343~ N\n°j\nU\n4)\n.Y4)'\n4)w\n4j 0\ni7r 0*ca f y\nHU) G C 0'O\n0\n.UI\n0\n'O\n4)Y0\n01\nr U Za» p tt C OUz90\n> o\no 2\no oU\n4)\nz\n-a 0\n.N 0tUo\n4)\n\n\n--- Page 36 ---\nBuilding on CREAC\n~E 4\nn 0 o~ .- o\nx So .? 0 o aQ '\noQ ~\nVn aa )\n- 7b' bO p\nQ c 0 -' on\nQ 0 rn \n'\n.cn c~j , 00oNa C ~\n-0 bU f C 0\na. o., 0 0 '\nroO\n`d Q t\nv Z ci~ o02021 91\n\n\n--- Page 37 ---\nThe University of Memphis Law Review\n-a 0\n0 cN C\n0-1\nb\nN 0\na\n.0U\n7SW0 r-\nIo0\na\nC b 0 ona 0\n05 ~ ~ ~ t 0-0-.\nCC a *d 0 3 C e-0\na\n-on\no Ra\no\n4- U~\n0\nzO\n© C92 Vol. 52\n\n\n--- Page 38 ---\nBuilding on CREAC\n\"OO M\n_ CO c\nU b CO\nC0JN t5) 53~ O b3!~ 0 0\n_ C)\n-G0 C\nO 0.0\n-p 0 ~ + ,J\n0\no M\nCO\nCO\nU\nC,)\na)CO\n0 . 2 . - a)\nCO) C\nCO L7 CAO -c\n-. v . --b 0J a) CO CO0)\nCO\nCO\na)\nGC\nC.)\nn O\nU\nj~I .N U - 4\"\nHU- > a.)\nC.) - s.___ _ _ b N b U c_____\nCOS\nv-0-\n0 - on.\no \n.3 c\nCO.

However, effectively explaining complex or large amounts of information,such as that contained in a textbook or library, in an intuitive, user-centered way is still\nan open challenge. Indeed, different people may search for and request different types\nof information, even though texts typically have a predeﬁned exposition and content.With this paper, we investigate how explanatory AI can better exploit the full potential\nof the vast and rich content library at our disposal. Based on a recent theory of expla-\nnations from Ordinary Language Philosophy, which frames the explanation process\nas illocutionary question-answering, we have developed a new type of interactive and\nadaptive textbook. Using the latest question-answering technology, our e-book soft-ware (Y AI4Edu, for short) generates on-demand, expandable explanations that can\nhelp readers effectively explore teaching materials in a pedagogically productive way.\nIt does this by extracting a specialized knowledge graph from a collection of booksor other resources that helps identify the most relevant questions to be answered for\na satisfactory explanation. We tested our technology with excerpts from a textbook\nthat teaches how to write legal memoranda in the U.S. legal system. Then, to seewhether Y AI4Edu-enhanced textbooks are better than random and existing, general-\npurpose explanatory tools, we conducted a within-subjects user study with more than\n100 English-speaking students. The students rated Y AI4Edu’s explanations the high-est. According to the students, the explanatory content generated by Y AI4Edu is, on\naverage, statistically better than two baseline alternatives ( Pvalues below .005).\nKeywords Intelligent textbooks ·Education ·Explanatory artiﬁcial intelligence ·\nAnswer retrieval ·Automated question extraction\nB Francesco Sovrano\nfrancesco.sovrano@uzh.ch\nExtended author information available on the last page of the article\n123\n\n--- Page 2 ---\n988 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\nIntroduction\nAs pointed out by UNESCO, the United Nations specialized agency for education,\nin one of its recent publications (Miao et al., 2021 ), the opportunities and challenges\nthat Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) offers for education in the AI era are yet to be fully\nunderstood. Nonetheless, the expectations are high given the potential of AI to fosterour ability to acquire and convey knowledge. Indeed, since the invention of writing,\nwe have collected a vast amount of written content that now forms the basis of our\ncollective wisdom and industriousness.\nHowever, fully harnessing the potential of such written knowledge by automati-\ncally explaining it in an intuitive and user-centered way is still an open problem .F o r\ninstance, different explainees\n1may search for and request different types of infor-\nmation, even though, usually, the exposition and content of an explanatory document\n(e.g., a book, an article, a web page, or technical documentation) are predetermined\nand static.\nDifferent books on the same subject expound the same knowledge in different ways\nand with different levels of detail. Additionally, this type of static representation is\nsub-optimal and time-consuming in the most generic scenario because helpful infor-\nmation may be sparse and scattered over hundreds or thousands of pages. As a result,\nexplaining to a person can be an extremely challenging task, regardless of whether theexplanandum\n2is from technical documentation, a scientiﬁc article, a regulation or a\ntextbook. Additionally, the complexity of this task is increased by the elusiveness of\nthe notion of explanation.\nTo address the problem of automatically explaining, we study how to automatically\nenhance static educational books by making them more interactive. We do this by\nreducing the sparsity of relevant information, thereby increasing the explanatory power\nof the medium while also linking it to a knowledge graph extracted from a collection\nof supplementary materials.\nThe approach is based on a recent theory from Ordinary Language Philosophy\n(Sovrano & Vitali, 2022a , explained in section “ Explanations According to Ordinary\nLanguage Philosophy ”), which views explaining as more than just providing answers\nto questions. It emphasizes that explaining involves answering unspoken or implicitquestions in a meaningful and relevant way to the individual seeking understanding.\nFor instance, if you ask “How are you doing?” and the response is “I am ﬁne”,\nthis is not an explanation. However, if the response is “I am okay because I wasworried I could have tested positive for COVID-19, but I am not, and [...]”, it becomes\nan explanation. The reason: this response intends to create an understanding of the\nperson’s state of being.\nThis concept of responding to implicit questions is called illocution (Sovrano &\nVitali, 2022a ). It makes the explanation process more focused on the individual seeking\nunderstanding. By anticipating these implicit questions, both the person explaining\n1Anexplainee is a person receiving an explanation.\n2The word explanandum means “what has to be explained” in Latin.\n123\n\n--- Page 3 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 989\nand the person seeking understanding can communicate more efﬁciently, resulting in\na reduction of steps required to explain something3.\nHence, assuming that the goal of an educational e-book is to explain something to the\nreader and consistent with the abovementioned deﬁnition of explanations (Sovrano &\nVitali, 2022a ,b), we built an explanatory process capable, through question-answering,\nof organizing a textbook’s explanatory space4to enable a reader to more efﬁciently and\neffectively retrieve helpful information. Speciﬁcally, our proposed solution consists\nof a pipeline of Explanatory AI (Y AI) algorithms and heuristics to build, on top of\ntextbooks, intelligent interfaces for:\n•answering explicit questions asked by a user;\n•automatically identifying the topics that can be explained by the contents of a\ntextbook (or any collection of texts);\n•generating explanations by anticipating a set of useful (implicit) questions a user\nmight have about the textbook.\nAssuming that the content of a textbook (or a collection of texts integrating it) properly\nexplains a given explanandum, our work relies on the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1 The most useful implicit questions a user may have about a collection of\ntexts are those best answered in the collection as a whole. These questions are neither\ntoo detailed (because they would otherwise only be answered in a minor part of the\ncollection) nor too general (because they would be answered inaccurately in the more\ndetailed textual content).\nIf the assumption mentioned above holds, we believe that the hypothesis is correct\nfor the following reasons:\n•any question falling outside the scope of the collection of documents could not be\nanswered, thus not being useful;\n•whoever wrote the textbook tried to explain as well as possible (for her/his narrative\npurposes) the most important topics at hand, thus (according to the adopted deﬁ-\nnition of explanation) implicitly identifying the most important questions whose\nanswers provide a good overview of the topics.\nConsequently, our main contribution is a novel pipeline of Y AI software for\nenhancing the explanatory power of a textbook based on an algorithm (called Intelli-gent Explanation Generator) for identifying the questions best answered by a collection\nof texts. Indeed, according to theory, what makes a Y AI good at explaining is its ability\nto identify implicit and relevant questions to answer, somehow anticipating the needsof the explainee.\nAs a case study for our proposed Y AI for education (Y AI4Edu, for short), we\nconsidered a teaching scenario where the excerpts of a textbook, “United States Legal\n3This theory has been supported by various experiments and studies involving over 190 participants\n(Sovrano & Vitali, 2022a ,b).\n4The explanatory space is the space of all possible bits of explanation about an explanandum. A more\nformal deﬁnition is given by Sovrano and Vitali ( 2022a ).\n123\n\n--- Page 4 ---\n990 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\nFig. 1 Example of intelligent explanatory overview generated by YAI4Edu.

The reader can select a new topic to overview by clicking on any underlined word\nLanguage and Culture: An Introduction to the U.S. Common Law System” (Brostoff &\nSinsheimer, 2013 ), together with the encyclopedia of the Legal Information Institute\nof the Cornell Law School and thousands of cases of the Board of Veterans’ Appeals\n(BV A)5are used for teaching how to write a legal memorandum6in support of a\ndisability claim for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) according to the U.S.legal system.\nThe complexity of legal jargon and intricate language in the ﬁeld of law offers a\nsubstantial test for Y AI4Edu, making our case study an ideal showcase of its abilities.\nWe utilize over 16,000 diverse resources for this study, including a textbook actively\nused in a University of Pittsburgh course. This enhances the study’s real-world practi-cality and educational relevance. When coupled with the important societal context of\nveterans’ PTSD disability claims, our case study highlights the potential of AI appli-\ncations in education, particularly in complex ﬁelds such as law. For an example of anintelligent explanation generated by Y AI4Edu in this scenario, see Fig. 1.\nAs an example to clarify what Hypothesis 1means in this case, let us suppose we\nwant to explain what a legal memorandum is. The textbook (Brostoff & Sinsheimer,2013 ) does it by describing what a memo is in a legal sense, what it is for, what the\nproper form of a legal memorandum is, and what sections it should include. The text-\n5The BV A is an administrative tribunal within the United States Department of Veterans Affairs that\ndetermines whether U.S. military veterans are entitled to claimed veterans’ beneﬁts and services.\n6A legal memorandum is an organized document that summarizes relevant laws to support a conclusion\non a particular legal issue.\n123\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 991\nbook also provides secondary details , explaining each step of drafting a memorandum,\nwhy writing a memo is difﬁcult, what the heading of a memorandum contains, and so\non. Hence, in this case, Hypothesis 1implies that the most useful implicit questions to\nask are not those whose answers are only secondary details. This is because they are\ntoo speciﬁc to represent the whole textbook’s explanatory content adequately. Instead,\nthe best choices are the main questions such as “what is the proper form of a legalmemorandum”, “what is a memo in a legal sense”, because they best represent the\ncontent of the textbook.\nTo evaluate Y AI4Edu and verify Hypothesis 1, we conducted a within-subjects\nuser study , comprising more than 100 students. This was done to study how different\nstrategies to identify helpful implicit questions impact the quality of the resulting\nexplanations. In particular, during the study, different explanations (an example isshown in Fig. 5) were given to English-speaking students about the task of writing a\nlegal memorandum . For more details about the explanations used in the experiment,\nsee Table 2.\nWe compared the explanations generated by the Intelligent Explanation Generator\n(relying on Hypothesis 1) with those of the following two baseline algorithms :\n•arandom explanations generator : an algorithm that organizes explanations by\nrandomly selecting implicit questions from those answered by the corpus of con-\nsidered texts;\n•ageneric explanations generator : an algorithm that uses very generic questions\n(e.g., why ,how ,what ) instead of those extracted from the textbook, under the\nassumption that all possible (implicit) questions are instances of such genericquestions.\nTheresults supported Hypothesis 1. They showed that our Intelligent Explanation\nGenerator outperforms the baselines mentioned above in all the considered expla-\nnations, selecting questions that are not too speciﬁc or generic. The differences in\nperformance were statistically signiﬁcant ( Pvalues below .005). Notably, the results\nalso show that the explanations generated from generic questions are signiﬁcantly\nbetter than those generated from random questions, giving further evidence in support\nof the validity of the hypothesis.\nSynopsis. In section “ Related Work ”, we discuss existing literature on interactive\ne-books for education, focusing on AI-based solutions. In section “ Background ”, we\nprovide sufﬁcient background to understand the theory behind the algorithms presentedin section “ Y AI4Edu: a Y AI for Improving the Explanatory Power of an Intelligent\nTextbook ”. Then, in section “ Case Study: A Textbook for Teaching How to Write\nLegal Memoranda ”, we present our case study on legal writing, and in section “ Exper-\niment ”, we introduce the experiment for verifying Hypothesis 1. Finally, in section\n“Discussion: Results and Limitations ” and section “ Limitations and Future Work ”, we\ndiscuss the experimental results and the limitations of the proposed approach, while\nalso highlighting potential avenues for future work.\n123\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n992 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\nRelatedWork\nSome studies suggest that using intelligent textbooks7and interactive e-books leads\nto an increase in use, motivation and learning gains versus static e-books (Ericson,\n2019 ). Of the several streams of work on the topic of interactive e-books and intelligent\ntextbooks, most focus on the cognitive process of the reader, studying how to enhancethe pedagogical productivity of textbooks through expert systems or sophisticated\ninterfaces. They usually accomplish this by:\n•showing personal progress through open learner models (Kay & Kummerfeld,\n2019 ,2021 );\n•specializing on ad hoc tasks through some domain modeling (Beier & Rau, 2022 ;\nDeligiannis et al., 2019 ; Chacon et al., 2021 ; Matsuda & Shimmei, 2019 );\n•modeling a student through questions, in order to identify and suggest personalized\ncontents (Thaker et al., 2019 ; Mohammed & Shaffer, 2021 ; Matsuda & Shimmei,\n2019 );\n•associating pedagogically valuable quizzes and exercises to portions of the e-book\n(Wang et al., 2022 ; Shimmei & Matsuda, 2022 ; Campenhout et al., 2021a ,b);\n•providing tools for manually creating new interactive e-books (Wang et al., 2021 ;\nP u r s e le ta l . , 2019 ; Kluga et al., 2019 ).\nThe use of AI for the automatic generation of interactive e-books seems to be under-\nexplored. In one such project, (Barria-Pineda et al., 2022 ) propose to automatically\naugment the sections of existing books with related YouTube videos by directly anno-\ntating the PDF, thus without breaking the structure of these textbooks.\nUnlike the previous literature examples, our approach attempts to fully automat-\nically convert an existing e-book into an interactive version by exploiting theories\nof explanations, intelligent interfaces, and Y AI. In particular, we are not interested\nin the task of generating verbatim\n8questions for quizzes or exercises as in Wang et\nal. (2022 ); Shimmei and Matsuda ( 2022 ); Campenhout et al. ( 2021a ,b). Instead we\npursue the idea that questions (even non-verbatim ones) can be a practical criterion to\norganize and categorize the content of explanations. Moreover, instead of considering\nany question as a suitable candidate for this task, we empirically show that some ques-\ntions are more useful than others and that the best questions for explanatory overviewsare neither too generic nor too speciﬁc.\nBackground\nThis section aims to provide enough background information for the reader to under-\nstand what an explanation is according to Ordinary Language Philosophy and the\nconsequent theory of Y AI.\n7Intelligent textbooks extend regular textbooks by integrating machine-manipulable knowledge (Wang et\nal.,2021 ).\n8The verbatim question is a question for which an answer can be identiﬁed in a related instructional text\n(i.e., source text) (Shimmei & Matsuda, 2022 ).\n123\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 993\nExplanations According to Ordinary Language Philosophy\nThe concept of explanation in philosophy9began to have a more precise role in the\n20th century with the growth and development of the philosophy of science. The\npublication by Hempel and Oppenheim ( 1948 ) of their “Studies in the Logic of\nExplanation” gave rise to what is considered the ﬁrst theory of explanations: thedeductive-nomological model. Sometime later, this ﬁrst model came to be considered\nfatally ﬂawed (Bromberger, 1966 ; Salmon, 1984 ). Indeed, Hempel’s epistemic the-\nory of explanations is not empiricist: it is concerned (mistakenly) only with logicalform, so an explanation can be such regardless of the actual processes and entities\nconceptually required to understand it.\nSeveral more modern and competing theories of explanation have resulted from\nthis criticism (Mayes, 2001 ). Some of these theories, for instance, those proposed by\nSalmon ( 1984 ) and van Fraassen ( 1980 ), take a scientiﬁc approach, framing explana-\ntions purely as answers to why questions. These theories represent a theoretical and\nlargely scientiﬁc interpretation of the process of explanation.\nOn the other hand, other theorists have taken a more grounded approach to the\nidea of explanations. These are grounded in the practicalities of how people perform\nexplanations in everyday life (Mayes, 2001 ). An exemplar of this approach is the\ntheory proposed by Achinstein ( 1983 ). His theory, which is ﬁrmly rooted in Ordinary\nLanguage Philosophy, underscores the communicative or linguistic aspect of an expla-\nnation. It highlights the importance of an explanation’s role in fostering understanding\nbetween individuals by answering questions.\nIn particular, according to Achinstein’s theory, explaining is an illocutionary act\nborn of a clear intention to produce new understandings in an explainee by providing\na correct content-giving answer to an open-ended question. According to this view,answering by “ﬁlling in the blanks” of a pre-deﬁned answer template, as with most\none-size-ﬁts-all approaches, prevents answering from being explanatory since it lacks\nthisillocutionary purpose.\nDespite this deﬁnition, illocution seems too abstract to implement in an actual\nsoftware application. Nonetheless, recent efforts towards the automated generation of\nexplanations (Sovrano & Vitali, 2021 ,2022b ), have shown that it may be possible\nto deﬁne illocution in a more “computer-friendly” way. Indeed, as stated by Sovrano\nand Vitali ( 2021 ), illocution in explaining involves informed and pertinent answers\nnot just to the main question but also to other questions that are implicitly relevant to\nthe explanations and the explainee. These questions can be understood as instances\nof archetypes such as why ,why not ,how ,what for ,what if ,what ,who ,\nwhen ,where ,how much ,e t c .\nDeﬁnition 1 (Illocution in Explaining) Explaining is an illocutionary act that provides\nanswers to an explicit question on some topic along with answers to several other\nimplicit or unformulated questions deemed necessary for the explainee to understand\nthe topic properly. Sometimes these implicit questions can be inferred through a thor-\nough analysis of the explainee’s background knowledge, history, and objectives, also\n9One of the ﬁrst known philosophers to work on the concept of explanation was Aristotle with his theory\nof causation (Stein, 2011 ).\n123\n\n--- Page 8 ---\n994 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\nconsidering Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). However, in the most generic case,\nno assumption can be made about the explainee’s knowledge and objectives. The only\nimplicit questions that can then be exploited for illocution are the most generic ones,\ncalled archetypal questions .\nFor example, if someone asks “How are you doing?”, an answer like “I am good”\nwould not be considered an explanation. By contrast, a different answer, such as “I\nam happy because I just got a paper accepted at this important venue, and [...]” would\ngenerally be considered an explanation because it answers other archetypal questions\nalong with the main question.\nDeﬁnition 2 (Archetypal Question) An archetypal question is an archetype applied\non a speciﬁc aspect of the explanandum. Examples of archetypes are the interrogative\nparticles (e.g., why ,how ,what ,who ,when ,where ), or their derivatives (e.g.,\nwhy not ,what for ,what if ,how much ), or also more complex interrogative\nformulas (e.g., what reason ,what cause ,what effect ). Accordingly, the\nsame archetypal question may be rewritten in several different ways, as “why” can berewritten in “what is the reason” or “what is the cause”.\nArchetypal Questions in Linguistic Theories\nCasting the semantic annotations of individual propositions as narrating an archetypal\nquestion-answer pair recently gained increasing attention in computational linguistics(He et al., 2015 ; FitzGerald et al., 2018 ; Michael et al., 2018 ; Pyatkin et al., 2020 ). In\nparticular, the main archetypes coming from Abstract Meaning Representation theory\n(Michael et al., 2018 )a r e :what ,who ,how ,where ,when ,which ,whose ,why .W e\nrefer to these archetypes as the primary ones because they consist only of interrogative\nparticles.\nOn the other hand, the main archetypes coming from PDTB-style discourse theory\n(Pyatkin et al., 2020 ) (also called secondary archetypes because they make use of\ntheprimary archetypes )a r e :in what manner ,what is the reason ,what\nis the result ,what is an example ,after what ,while what ,in\nwhat case ,despite what ,what is contrasted with ,before\nwhat ,since when ,what is similar ,until when ,instead of\nwhat ,what is an alternative ,except when ,unless what .\nAlthough many more archetypes could be devised (e.g., where to orwho by ),\nwe believe that the list of questions we provided earlier is already rich enough to be\ngenerally representative, whereas more speciﬁc questions can always be framed by\nusing the interrogative particles we considered (e.g., why ,what ).Primary archetypes\ncan be used to represent any fact and abstract meaning (Bos, 2016 ). In contrast, the\nsecondary archetypes can cover all the discourse relations between them (at least\naccording to the PDTB theory).\n123\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 995\nHow to Measure the Degree of Explainability\nDegree of Explainability (DoX) is a model-agnostic approach and metric, proposed by\nSovrano and Vitali ( 2022c ), toobjectively evaluate explainability. It builds on Achin-\nstein’s theory of explanations and the interpretation of illocution given by Sovrano\nand Vitali ( 2022b ). DoX can quantify the degree of explainability of a corpus of texts\nby estimating how adequately that corpus could be used to answer in an illocutionary\nway an arbitrary set of archetypal questions about the explanandum.\nIn other words, Sovrano and Vitali ( 2022c ) show how the degree of explainability\nof information depends on the number of archetypal questions to which it can ade-\nquately answer. In practice, DoX scores are computed by measuring and aggregating\nthepertinence with which a snippet of text can answer a (pre-deﬁned) set of archety-\npal questions. Speciﬁcally, pertinence scores are obtained employing pre-trained deep\nlanguage models for general-purpose answer retrieval (Karpukhin et al., 2020 ;B o w -\nman et al., 2015 ) applied to a particular graph of triplets automatically extracted from\ntext to facilitate this type of information retrieval.\nExplanatory Artificial Intelligence\nAn Explanatory AI (Y AI) is an artiﬁcial intelligence program designed to gener-\nate user-centered, interactive explanations out of (possibly extensive) collections of\nexplainable information (Sovrano & Vitali, 2022a ). An example of Y AI based on\nAchinstein’s theory of explanation is Y AI4Hu10(Sovrano & Vitali, 2021 ,2022b ).\nY AI4Hu is a fully automatic explanatory tool that explains (pre-existing) doc-\numentation about an AI-based system. In particular, the textual content of such\ndocumentation is algorithmically reorganized and represented as a special hypergraphwhere information can be either explored through overviewing or searched via open-\nended questioning . On the one hand, open-ended questioning can be performed by\nasking open-ended questions in English through a search box that uses the knowledgegraph for efﬁcient answer retrieval.\nOn the other hand, overviewing can be performed iteratively from an initial expla-\nnation by clicking on automatically annotated words for which more information isneeded. In particular, annotated words are visible because they have a unique format\nthat makes them easy to recognize. After clicking on an annotation, a modal window\nopens (see Fig. 1), showing a navigation bar of tabs containing explanatory overviews\nof the clicked annotated words. The information shown in the overview is as follows:\n•A short description of the explained word (if available).\n•The list of other words that are taxonomically connected.\n•A list of pre-deﬁned archetypal questions (e.g., why is this aspect/concept impor-\ntant, what is this aspect/concept, etc.) and their respective answers ordered by esti-\nmated pertinence (see section “ Intelligent Explanation Generator: An Algorithm\n10Y AI4Hu stands for Y AI for Humans. Examples of Y AI for reinforcement learning agents are discussed\nby Sovrano et al. ( 2022 ).\n123\n\n--- Page 10 ---\n996 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\nfor the Identiﬁcation of Pedagogically Useful Questions from Textbooks ”f o ra\ndeﬁnition of pertinence).\nYAI4Edu:aYAIforImprovingtheExplanatoryPowerofanIntelligent\nTextbook\nThe beneﬁt of answering questions for learning has been shown in many studies\n(Rivers, 2021 ; Pan & Rickard, 2018 ), further supporting the assertion that explaining\nis akin to question-answering and that organizing contents on a question-answer base\nmight be beneﬁcial for the explainee. However, creating questions with proper detailthat effectively helps students’ learning usually requires experience and extensive\nefforts (Shimmei & Matsuda, 2022 ).\nFor this reason, with the present work, we propose Y AI4Edu (pipeline shown in\nFig. 2), an extension of Y AI4Hu (see section “ Explanatory Artiﬁcial Intelligence ”) to\nautomatically transform static educative e-books (in PDF, XML or HTML format) into\ninteractive intelligent textbooks by increasing their explanatory power. Similarly toY AI4Hu, Y AI4Edu uses open-ended questioning andoverviewing as main mechanisms\nfor producing explanations. More speciﬁcally, interaction is given by: i)word glosses\nthat can be clicked to open an overview ;ii)a special kind of search box that allows\nthe reader to get answers to any open-ended English question.\nIn particular, we exploit Achinstein’s theory of explanations to reorganize, on-\ndemand, the contents of a textbook and connect it with external integrative resources(e.g., an encyclopedia) to provide the user with more useful explanations. We build a\nnovel heuristic to identify and anticipate the most useful implicit questions an explainee\nFig. 2 Simpliﬁed Flow Diagram of YAI4Edu. This diagram shows the main components of Y AI4Edu.\nAs in Y AI4Hu, the user can ask questions and get overviews. However, differently, Y AI4Edu uses a new\ncomponent (i.e., the “Intelligent Explanation Generator”) for generating overviews, as described in section\n“Intelligent Explanation Generator: An Algorithm for the Identiﬁcation of Pedagogically Useful Questions\nfrom Textbooks ”\n123\n\n--- Page 11 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 997\nmight have about a textbook, organizing information accordingly. Indeed, according\nto theory (see section “ Explanations According to Ordinary Language Philosophy ”),\nwhat makes an Explanatory AI good at explaining is its ability to identify implicit andrelevant questions to answer, i.e., its illocutionary power .\nWe developed an algorithm capable of automatically extracting questions from\na textbook and identifying those that are neither too detailed (because they wouldotherwise only be answered in a minor part of the textbook) nor too general (because\nthey would be answered inaccurately in the more detailed textual content). We did it\nby starting from the hypothesis that the most useful implicit questions a user may haveabout a collection of texts are those best answered by the whole collection.\nSuppose it is possible to quantify the explanatory power of a collection of\nexplainable texts (i.e., through DoX; see section “ How to Measure the Degree of\nExplainability ”) and organize it accordingly by prioritizing the most explanatory con-\ntents (i.e., those with the highest DoX scores) over the others. In that case, it is also\npossible to identify which texts are the most explained within a corpus of documentsand, therefore, the most useful questions to ask about the textbook. More speciﬁcally,\nfor Y AI4Edu, we developed several AI-based mechanisms that improve over the base-\nline Y AI4Hu algorithm producing more pedagogically useful explanations via:\n•intelligent overviewing (an example of overview is shown in Fig. 3), by auto-\nmatically extracting the most useful questions that the textbook (or the support\nmaterial) is answering;\n•smart annotation generation, through the automatic identiﬁcation of a glossary of\nwords explained by the textbook’s contents.\nIn the following subsections, we will describe the technical details behind these\nnew mechanisms and brieﬂy summarize how the answer retrieval algorithm works.\nWe also release the source code of Y AI4Edu\n11and the anonymized data collected\nto evaluate it (see section “ Experiment ”) under MIT license at https://github.com/\nFrancesco-Sovrano/Y AI4Edu .\nAutomated Question Extraction for Intelligent Overviewing\nAccording to theory, illocution in explaining involves informed and pertinent answer-\ning questions, implicitly relevant to the explanations and the explainee, understood\nas instances of archetypes. In section “ Archetypal Questions in Linguistic Theories ”,\nwe presented different types of these archetypal questions identiﬁed by foundationallinguistic theories.\nSpeciﬁcally, the secondary archetypes coming from discourse theory (Pyatkin et al.,\n2020 ) are meant to capture how Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs)\n12are connected.\nIn contrast, the primary archetypes coming from Abstract Meaning Representation\ntheory13(Michael et al., 2018 ) are meant to capture the informative components within\n11We cannot release the textbook excerpts (Brostoff & Sinsheimer, 2013 ) because they are copyrighted.\n12The smallest unit of coherent text that expresses a complete or partial discourse relation.\n13A semantic formalism that represents the meaning of natural language sentences as rooted, directed, and\nlabeled graphs.\n123\n\n--- Page 12 ---\n998 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\nFig. 3 Flow Diagram of the Intelligent Explanation Generator. This diagram shows how an explainee\ncan obtain an intelligent overview. First, the user decides which aspect of the explanandum to overview(i.e., by clicking on an annotated word available on the screen). Then the system extracts an explanation\nfrom the textbook or any other collection of texts (e.g., other textbooks, an encyclopedia) by using an AI\nfor question extraction and an AI for answer retrieval as described in section “ Answer Retrieval ”\nthe EDUs by possibly supporting answering basic questions such as “ who didwhat\ntowhom ,when orwhere ”. For example, from the sentence, “ The existence and\nvalidity of a contract, or any term of a contract, shall be determined by the law which\nwould govern it under this regulation if the contract or term were valid, ” it is possible\nto extract the following discourse relation14about contingency: “In what case would\nthe law govern under this regulation? If the contract or term were valid, ” and the\nfollowing Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) question-answer: “By what is the\nexistence and validity of a contract determined? By the law that would govern it underthis regulation if the contract or clause were valid.”\nIn particular, the discourse-based and AMR-based archetypal questions we need for\nY AI4Edu are extracted from sentences and paragraphs through a deep language modelbased on T5\n15(Raffel et al., 2020 ), pre-trained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised\nand supervised tasks.\nSince vanilla T5 is not trained to extract discourse-based and AMR-based questions,\nwe had to ﬁne-tune T5 on some public datasets designed for this task. These datasets are\nQAMR (Michael et al., 2018 ) for extracting AMR-based questions and QADiscourse\n(Pyatkin et al., 2020 ) for discourse-based questions.\nMost importantly, the QAMR and QADiscourse datasets are unrelated to any of\nthe textbooks we will consider (see section “ Case Study: A Textbook for Teaching\n14A discourse relation identiﬁes two EDUs: the ﬁrst one is encoded in the question, the second one in the\nanswer.\n15T5 is an encoder-decoder model based on the assumption that all Natural Language Processing problems\ncan be converted in a text-to-text problem.\n123\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 999\nHow to Write Legal Memoranda ”) for evaluating Y AI4Edu. In particular, they do not\ncontain any legal document or snippet of text written in legalese. In other words, we\ndo not reﬁne T5 on legal texts but instead train it on spoken English, given the highdata availability. Therefore, training T5 the way we do does not imply any legal ﬁne-\ntuning. Legal ﬁne-tuning would require the costly extraction of a dataset of AMR-\nand discourse-based questions from legal texts, as well as ad-hoc adaptations of thetheories of discourse and abstract meaning representation to legalese.\nIn particular, the QAMR dataset is made of 107,880 different questions (and\nanswers), while the QADiscourse dataset is made of 16,613 different questions (andanswers), as described in section “ Archetypal Questions in Linguistic Theories ”. The\ntwo considered datasets are tuples of <s,q,a>, where sis a source sentence, qis a\nquestion implicitly expressed in s, and ais an answer expressed in s. T5 is ﬁne-tuned\nto tackle at once the following four tasks per dataset:\n•extract agiven sandq,\n•extract qgiven sanda,\n•extract all the possible qgiven s,\n•extract all the possible agiven s.\nSpeciﬁcally, we ﬁne-tuned the T5 model on QAMR and QADiscourse for ﬁve\nepochs.\n16The objective of the ﬁne-tuning was to minimize a loss function measuring\nthe difference between the expected output and the output given by T5. A mathematical\ndeﬁnition of such a loss function is given by Raffel et al. ( 2020 ).\nAt the end of the training, the average loss was 0 .4098, meaning that our ﬁne-\ntuned T5 model cannot perfectly extract AMRs or EDUs from the text composing the\ntraining set. On the one hand, this is a good thing because it is likely that the model did\nnot over-ﬁt the training set. On the other hand, this clearly indicates that the questionsextracted by our T5 model can be imperfect, containing errors that could propagate to\nthe Intelligent Explanation Generator.\nIntelligent Explanation Generator: An Algorithm for the Identification\nof Pedagogically Useful Questions from Textbooks\nAssuming that the goal of a textbook is to explain something to the reader, and based on\nthe theoretical understandings expressed in section “ Explanations According to Ordi-\nnary Language Philosophy ”, our Y AI4Edu is designed around the idea that organizing\nthe explanatory space (i.e., the space of all possible bits of explanation) as clusters of\narchetypal questions and answers is beneﬁcial for an explainee. In particular, Y AI4Edu\nuses the following predeﬁned interactions inherited from Y AI4Hu to allow the user toexplore this explanatory space:\n•Open-ended Question-Answering: the user writes a question and receives one or\nmore relevant answers.\n•Aspect Overviewing: the user selects an aspect of the explanandum (i.e., contained\nin an answer) and receives as an explanation a set of relevant archetypal answers\n16An epoch is one complete cycle through the entire training dataset.\n123\n\n--- Page 14 ---\n1000 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\ninvolving different aspects that can be explored as well. Archetypal answers can\nalso be expanded, increasing the level of detail.\nAs hypothesized (cf. Hypothesis 1), archetypal questions that are too generic are\nunlikely to represent the explanatory goals of a sufﬁciently complex and elaborated col-\nlection of texts. The archetypal questions originally used by Y AI4Hu for overviewing\nare too generic and predeﬁned, frequently not adhering to the explanatory requirements\nof the overview. Therefore, considering the need for Y AI4Edu to be pedagogically\nhelpful, we designed a novel theoretically grounded AI algorithm to quantify howmuch an archetypal question is likely to represent the explanatory goals of a collec-\ntion of texts. We called this algorithm the Intelligent Explanation Generator.\nMore speciﬁcally, instead of using predeﬁned generic archetypal questions for our\nIntelligent Explanation Generator, we also consider more domain-speciﬁc ones auto-\nmatically extracted from the knowledge graph through the AI for question-answerextraction. In particular, once an explanandum is chosen, the workﬂow of the Intelli-\ngent Explanation Generator consists of the following steps (also shown in Fig. 3).\n•Step 1: the algorithm computes the DoX (see section “ How to Measure the Degree\nof Explainability ”) of all snippets of text about a given explanandum (i.e., an aspect\nto overview), ﬁnding the top ksnippets with the highest DoX and also ﬁnding the\narchetypal questions extracted from them by the algorithm described in section\n“Automated Question Extraction for Intelligent Overviewing ”;\n•Step 2: for each question selected in the previous step, the algorithm identiﬁes a set\nof pertinent answers within the text snippets. An answer is said to be pertinent to\na question when its pertinence score\n17is greater than a given pertinence threshold\np;\n•Step 3: the algorithm ﬁlters the pertinent answers, keeping the best qquestions\nandaanswers by executing the following sub-steps: i)questions that are too long\nare removed, i.e., questions whose length (without considering the length of the\nexplanandum label) exceeds a threshold L;ii)if a question has some grammatical\nerror, it is automatically corrected via Gramformer18, a deep neural network; iii)\nquestions that are too similar are removed,19prioritizing the questions extracted\nfrom the most explanatory snippets (i.e., those with the highest DoX) and the\nshortest questions; iv)answers that are too short or too long are removed; v)the\nquestions with no valid answers are removed; vi)the answers that could be assigned\nto several questions are given to the question with the highest estimated pertinence;\nvii)for each question, only the aanswers with the highest pertinence score are\nkept; viii) the questions are sorted by the decreasing pertinence of the ﬁrst answer,\nand only the top qquestions are kept.\nImportantly, step 1 is performed before step 2 to reduce the asymptotic time com-\nplexity of step 2. Selecting the questions best answered by the corpus (step 2) has\n17Pertinence scores are numbers in [0,1]computed by measuring the cosine similarity between vectorial\nrepresentations of question and answer obtained through deep neural networks specialized for answer\nretrieval.\n18https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/Gramformer\n19A question is said to be similar to another when its similarity score is above a given threshold s. Similarity\nscores are calculated like pertinence scores.\n123\n\n--- Page 15 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 1001\nan asymptotic complexity O(|Qc|·|S|)that grows with the number of questions\nextracted from the snippets of text, where Qis the set of questions about an aspect c\nto be explained and Sis the set of snippets of text. Therefore, this complexity in the\nworst-case scenario (without step 1) can be quadratic in the size of the textbook or\ncollection of texts, i.e., O(|S|2).\nRather than having a quadratic complexity, a computationally simpler approach can\nperform an initial ﬁltering procedure to consider only those questions coming from\nthe paragraphs with the highest DoX (as step 1 does), thus converting |Qc|into a\nconstant number independent from |S|. Hence, considering that computing the DoX\nof|S|snippets of text has an asymptotic time complexity equal to O(|S|), it follows\nthat step 1 reduces the complexity of the Intelligent Explanation Generator to O(|S|).\nIf Hypothesis 1is true, then the Intelligent Explanation Generator will be able to\nproduce better and more satisfying explanation overviews (than the baseline Y AI4Hu).\nThis is because it will be able to anticipate, in a sense, implicit questions the user may\nhave.\nNot all words, though, require an overview. That is because, in practice, only a tiny\nfraction of the words in a text are helpful to explain. Indeed, many words have common-\nsense meanings (e.g., the words: “and”, “ﬁrst”, “ﬁgure”) and, therefore, should not be\nexplained. Otherwise, the explainee might be overwhelmed by largely redundant and\npointless information that would only hinder the usability of the Y AI.\nTo intelligently avoid jotting down unnecessary words, our smart annotation mecha-\nnism only annotates those concepts and words that can be explained by (the knowledge\ngraph extracted from) the textbook and other supplementary texts. More speciﬁcally, tounderstand whether a word should be annotated, the algorithm executes the following\ninstructions:\n•It checks whether the word is a stop word (i.e., a commonly used word such as\n“and” or “or”). If so, the word is not annotated.\n•If the word is not a stop word, the algorithm generates its overview through the\nIntelligent Explanation Generator. Then, it computes the cumulative pertinence\nscore of the answers composing the overview; if greater than a given threshold, it\nannotates the word.\nThis annotation mechanism is intended to remove noisy annotations and distractors\nso that the reader can focus only on the most central and well-explained concepts.\nMoreover, the cumulative pertinence score, used to understand whether a word shouldbe annotated, can also be used to understand the topics in the corpus of documents\nthat are better explained.\nConsequently, the smart annotation mechanism and the Intelligent Explanation\nGenerator are integral components of the Y AI4Edu system. Notably, the Intelli-\ngent Explanation Generator tackles the challenge of selecting questions that balancebetween being too general or overly speciﬁc through the abovementioned ﬁltering and\nreﬁnement steps. By incorporating these steps, the Intelligent Explanation Generator\nprioritizes questions derived from the most informative excerpts, favors concise ques-tions, and ﬁlters out excessively similar ones. This process aims to identify questions\nthat align well with the explanatory objectives of the text collection, as discussed in\nsection “ Discussion: Results and Limitations ”.\n123\n\n--- Page 16 ---\n1002 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\nAnswer Retrieval\nSimilarly to Y AI4Hu, Y AI4Edu uses a pipeline of AI algorithms to extract a particular\ngraph of knowledge from a collection of texts that an information retrieval system can\nexploit to answer a given question. In particular, a dependency parser detects all the\npossible grammatical clauses20within the collection of texts. Each such clause stands\nfor an edge of the knowledge graph.\nIn practice, these clauses are represented as combinations of subjects, templates, and\nobjects/nominal modiﬁers.21We refer to these as template-triplets. Speciﬁcally, tem-\nplates consist of an ordered token sequence connecting subjects and objects/modiﬁers\nin a clause. In these templates, the subjects and the objects/modiﬁers are represented\nby the placeholders “ {subj}/prime/primeand “{obj}/prime/prime, respectively. The resulting template-triplets\nare a sort of function where the predicate is the body, and the object/modiﬁer and the\nsubject are the parameters.\nObtaining a natural language representation of these template-triplets involves\nreplacing the instances of the parameters in the body. This natural language representa-\ntion is then used as a possible answer for retrieval by measuring the similarity betweenits embedding and the embedding of a question. An example (taken from the case\nstudy discussed in section “ Case Study: A Textbook for Teaching How to Write Legal\nMemoranda ”) of template-triple is:\n•Subject: “A constitution”\n•Template: “ {subj}\n/prime/primespeciﬁcally deﬁnes, empowers, and imposes {obj}on each\npart of the governmental structure\n•Object: “limits”\nThe resulting knowledge graph is imperfect because of the adopted extraction proce-\ndure. It may contain mistakes caused by wrongly identiﬁed grammatical dependencies\nor other issues. However, the likelihood of such errors occurring is relatively low. This\nis primarily attributed to the high accuracy of the model we used for part-of-speech\ntagging.22\nTo increase the interoperability of the extracted knowledge graph with external\nresources, we formatted it as an RDF23graph. In particular, RDF has features that\nfacilitate data merging even if the underlying schemas differ. To format a graph of\ntemplate triplets in an RDF graph, we performed the following steps:\n20A typical clause consists of a subject and a syntactic predicate, the latter typically a verb phrase composed\nof a verb with any objects and other modiﬁers.\n21A nominal modiﬁer is a noun (or noun phrase) functioning as a non-core (oblique) argument or adjunct.\n22Known as the “en_core_web_md” model, it boasts an accuracy score of 0.97. More details about this\nmodel can be found at https://spacy.io/models/en .\n23RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web (Allemang and Hendler, 2011 ).\n123\n\n--- Page 17 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 1003\n•We assigned a URI24to every node (i.e., subject and object) and edge (i.e., tem-\nplate) of the graph by lemmatizing the associated text. We assigned an RDFS25\nlabel to each URI corresponding to the associated text.\n•We added special triplets to keep track of the sources from which the template-\ntriplets were extracted so that each node and edge can refer to its source document\nor paragraph.\n•We added sub-class relations between composite concepts (syntagms) and the\nsimplest concepts (if any) composing the syntagm. For instance, “ contractual\nobligation ” is a sub-class of “ obligation ”. Therefore, we employ the RDFS predi-\ncate “{subj}rdfs:subClassOf {obj}/prime/primeas a template for the triplet that signiﬁes\nthis sub-class relationship.\nFor more technical details about how we performed all the steps mentioned above to\nconvert the template-triplets into an RDF graph, please refer to Sovrano et al. ( 2020 )\nor the source code of Y AI4Edu.\nFinally, the algorithm to retrieve answers from the extracted knowledge graph\nis based on the following steps. Let Cbe the set of concepts in a question q,\nm=<s,t,o>be a template-triplet, u=t(s,o)be the natural language representa-\ntion of m, also called an information unit , and zbe its source paragraph. DiscoLQA\nretrieves answers by ﬁnding the most similar concepts to Cwithin the knowledge\ngraph, retrieving all their related template-triplets m(including those of the sub-\nclasses), and selecting, among the natural language representations uof the retrieved\ntemplate-triplets, those that are likely to answer q. The likelihood of uanswering qis\nestimated by computing the cosine similarity between its contextualized embedding\n<u,z>and the embedding of q.I f <u,z>is similar enough to q, then zis said to\nanswer q.\nThe embeddings of <u,z>andqare obtained through a deep language model\nspecialized in answer retrieval pre-trained in ordinary English to associate similar\nvectorial representations to a question and its correct answers. The pre-trained deeplanguage model we employed in implementing Y AI4Edu is a variation of MiniLM\n(Wang et al., 2021 ) published by Reimers and Gurevych ( 2019 ).\nCaseStudy:ATextbookforTeachingHowtoWriteLegalMemoranda\nTo showcase and evaluate Y AI4Edu, we considered a case study in the intersection\nbetween AI and law. In particular, we applied Y AI4Edu to the following materialexplaining, among other things, how to write a legal memorandum in a U.S. legal\ncontext for a veteran’s PTSD disability claim:\n24A URI, or Uniform Resource Identiﬁer, is a string of characters that provides a simple and extensible\nmeans for identifying a resource on the Internet.\n25RDFS, or RDF Schema, is a language used for creating vocabularies in the semantic web, allowing for\nthe description of classes, properties, and their interrelationships.\n123\n\n--- Page 18 ---\n1004 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\n•22 pages excerpted from the textbook “ United States Legal Language and Culture:\nAn Introduction to the U.S. Common Law System ” (Brostoff & Sinsheimer, 2013\npp. 47-60, 93-96, 101-103, 131-132).26\n•5,407 open access web pages about concepts related to the U.S. legal system\ncoming from the encyclopedia of the Legal Information Institute of the Cornell\nLaw School27(5,406 web pages) and Wikipedia28(1 web page).\n•11,198 legal cases on PTSD disability claims taken from the ofﬁcial website of\nthe Board of Veterans’ Appeals (BV A).29\nAltogether, the included material, comprising more than 16,000 documents, com-\nplements the primary teaching material on which Y AI4Edu focuses, i.e., the excerpts\nof the selected textbook. In particular, the textbook is used in “Applied Legal Ana-lytics and AI,”\n30an interdisciplinary course at the University of Pittsburgh, co-taught\nby instructors from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law and Carnegie Mel-\nlon University’s Language Technologies Institute. It provides “a hands-on practicalintroduction to the ﬁelds of artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, and natural lan-\nguage processing as they are being applied to support the work of legal professionals,\nresearchers, and administrators.”\nTeaching how to write a legal memorandum for the U.S. legal system is a course\nobjective, in part, because in a common law system, such as the American one, the\nuse of AI assists practitioners in efﬁciently retrieving legal cases for constructing\narguments (Phelps & Ashley, 2022 ). Alegal memorandum is an organized document\nthat summarizes relevant laws to support a conclusion on a particular legal issue.Writing it can require legal practitioners to navigate through large databases of cases,\ni.e., to retrieve the deﬁnitions of technical and speciﬁc concepts or to understand which\nargumentation patterns are most common in a particular context. Indeed, some of thedistinguishing features of legal writing are:\n•Authority: The writer must back up assertions and statements with citations of\nauthority (i.e., precedents and other decided cases).\n•Argument re-use: A more effective memorandum may reuse existing documents\nas templates or argumentation patterns.\n•Formality: The written legal document should be properly formatted according to\nexisting standards.\nHence, legal practitioners may now be required to learn how to efﬁciently and effec-\ntively interact with existing AI-based technological solutions for information retrieval\nto speed up legal writing and to learn the complexities of legal writing. Given the task’s\ncomplexity and the course’s goals, we envisaged that it might be of utmost relevance\nand utility to design and create a tool such as Y AI4Edu that could ease the acquisitionof the necessary knowledge for a student to learn legal writing.\n26We received explicit consent from the copyright holder to use excerpts of this textbook for our experi-\nments and the related scientiﬁc publications.\n27https://www.law.cornell.edu\n28https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States\n29https://search.usa.gov/search?afﬁliate=bvadecisions&sort_by=&query=PTSD&commit=Search\n30https://www.law.pitt.edu/academics/courses/catalog/5719\n123\n\n--- Page 19 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 1005\nTable 1 Useful statistics about the case study : the column “Documents” shows the number of documents\nDocuments Extracted\nQuestionsConcepts Y AI\nConceptsKG Size Tokens Tokens per\nDoc\nTextbook &\nWeb Pages5,408 246,747 115,110 3,407 2,059,145 707,317 130.79\n+L e g a l\nCases11,198 1,062,716 1,410,694 4,579 52,987,778 28,630,575 2,556.75\n= Total 16,606 1,309,463 1,525,804 7,986 55,046,923 29,337,892 1,766.7\n“Extracted Questions” provides the number of different questions extracted by the algorithm described in\nsection “ Automated Question Extraction for Intelligent Overviewing ”. “Concepts” shows the number of\ndifferent concepts/topics identiﬁed in the collection of documents. “Y AI Concepts” provides the number\nof topics that can be explained by the algorithm described in section “ Intelligent Explanation Generator:\nAn Algorithm for the Identiﬁcation of Pedagogically Useful Questions from Textbooks ”. “KG Size” shows\nthe number of RDF triplets composing the knowledge graph (KG) extracted by the algorithm described in\nsection “ Answer Retrieval ”. “Tokens” shows the total number of tokens (e.g., words) in the collection of\ndocuments. “Tokens per Doc” shows the mean number of tokens per document\nSpeciﬁcally, Y AI4Edu should help students understand, from real examples, how\nto write a legal memorandum comprising legal arguments to defend or attack a claim.\nIn particular, students have to understand how to use statutes, read and summarizecases, synthesize cases, draft a legal memorandum, and use legal concepts in writing.\nThis may involve learning legal concepts as well as skills of making arguments with\nconcrete cases selected using legal information retrieval tools, as is typical in the U.S.legal context.\nIn particular, applying Y AI4Edu to the collection of documents mentioned above,\nwe extracted a knowledge graph of 52,987,778 RDF triplets from the BV A cases and aknowledge graph of 2,059,145 RDF triplets from the textbook excerpts and the other\nweb pages; other statistics are shown in Table 1.\nThanks to the compositional nature of RDF graphs, we can combine smaller indi-\nvidual graphs into larger ones without altering the original meaning or semantics.\nTaking advantage of this feature, we enriched the graph with about ten manually added\nRDF triplets to ﬁll identiﬁed knowledge gaps, such as “memo” being a synonym for“memorandum”. These gaps surfaced during software testing.\nHowever, we have not thoroughly analyzed the whole extracted RDF graph. As a\nresult, other knowledge gaps may yet emerge. Despite our incomplete analysis, webelieve this property of compositionality of the knowledge graph used by Y AI4Edu is of\nutmost importance. Indeed, it enables manually correcting any error produced during\nthe graph extraction and easily integrating it with additional or missing knowledge.\nThis knowledge graph helped to build an interactive and intelligent version of the\ntextbook, as described in section “ Y AI4Edu: a Y AI for Improving the Explanatory\nPower of an Intelligent Textbook ” and shown in Fig. 2.

In\nparticular, the hyper-parameters chosen for this instance of Y AI4Edu are the following:\ni)number of snippets with the highest DoX to consider k=10;ii)answer pertinence\nthreshold p=.57;iii)maximum overview question length L=50;iv)question sim-\nilarity threshold s=.95;v)minimum and maximum answer length equal to 150 and\n1000; vi)maximum number of questions per overview q=4;vii)maximum number\nof answers per overview question a=2.\nExperiment\nExplanations and explanatory tools may be complex artifacts whose quality depends\non a wide range of different factors (Sovrano et al., 2020 ), including:\n•the quality of the explainable information;\n•the logic used for presenting this information, namely the set of rules employed to\npresent the information in a meaningful and coherent manner, which we refer to\nas the presentation logic ;\n•the quality of the interface.\nIn particular, with this experiment, we are interested in evaluating the presentation\nlogic used by Y AI4Edu for selecting and reorganizing questions and answers into\nexplanations.\n123\n\n--- Page 21 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 1007\nSovrano and Vitali ( 2022a ) have already demonstrated, with several examples and\nexperiments, a user-centered Y AI is better than one-size-ﬁts-all and static explanations.\nIn this experiment, instead of evaluating the whole interactive e-book with a rathertime-consuming test, we focused on evaluating the one feature of Y AI4Edu that should\nbe responsible for improving the explanatory power of the e-book: the Intelligent\nExplanation Generator. According to theory (see section “ Explanations According to\nOrdinary Language Philosophy ”), what makes a Y AI good at explaining is its ability\nto identify implicit and relevant questions to answer, i.e., its illocutionary power.\nTherefore, in this experiment (which is a within-subjects user study), we directly\nask real students to rate explanations (on a scale of 0 to 5 stars) for how well they\nadequately explain a given topic, as shown in Fig. 5. We do it to understand the extent\nto which the explanations generated by our Intelligent Explanation Generator aresatisfactory and whether they are better than baseline explanatory strategies, as stated\nby Hypothesis 1. More details about the experiment can be found in Appendix A.\nThe two baselines against which the Intelligent Explanation Generator is compared\nare variants of the same. They use the same sequence of steps to generate their expla-\nnations, apart from the step responsible for selecting the explanatory questions, which\nis different. These two baselines are:\n•An explainer that uses randomly chosen questions to organize the contents of an\noverview . This explainer randomly selects q=4 questions, setting the maximum\nquestion length to L=∞ and using a lower answer pertinence threshold p=.3\n(and not p=.57 as in the Intelligent Explanation Generator). This prevents the\nnumber of questions from diminishing too much due to not ﬁnding sufﬁciently\nrelevant answers.\nFig. 5 Screenshot of the web application used during the experiment. This ﬁgure shows what the\nparticipants in the user study see during the experiment\n123\n\n--- Page 22 ---\n1008 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\n•Y AI4Hu’s generic overview generator, which instead employs pre-deﬁned and\nvery generic archetypal questions, using the same four questions (i.e., what is it,\nhow is it,where is it and why ) for each topic.\nGiven the case study at hand (see section “ Case Study: A Textbook for Teaching\nHow to Write Legal Memoranda ”), the main objective of the explanatory contents is\nto explain how to write a legal memorandum appropriate for the U.S. legal system and\na veteran’s PTSD disability claim. The excerpts of the considered textbook are aboutlegal writing, while the collection of legal cases of the BV A are about PTSD disability\nclaims. Thus, we can say that some of the goals of the Y AI for this case study are to\nexplain: i)what is the proper form of a legal memorandum; ii)what sections should be\nincluded in a legal memorandum; iii)what legal standard does a veteran need to satisfy\nfor a disability claim; iv)what are the elements of the legal standard a veteran needs\nto satisfy for a disability claim; v)what issues do the required elements of a disability\nclaim raise; and vi)what kinds of legal arguments are appropriate for resolving such\nissues.\nConsidering that we need an experiment lasting a maximum of 10 minutes (in order\nto minimize costs: each participant cannot be paid less than 6£ per hour on Proliﬁc),\nwe chose the following three topics for evaluating the explainers:\n•Topic 1: The proper form of a legal memorandum.\n•Topic 2: The effects of a disability.\n•Topic 3: The elements of the legal standard a veteran needs to satisfy for a PTSD\ndisability claim.\nIn particular, the explanations for the ﬁrst two topics are extracted from the textbook\nand web pages (the ﬁrst is better explained by the textbook, the second by the web\npages). In contrast, the explanations for the third topic are extracted from legal cases.For more details about the explanations used in the experiment, see Table 2.\nDiscussion:ResultsandLimitations\nThrough Proliﬁc, we gathered 130 participants, all students aged between 19 and 38.\n28 participants were discarded for the reasons stated in Appendix A. Eventually, 102\nvalid submissions were collected.\nThe results (shown in Fig. 6) indicate that the intelligent explainer received the\nhighest rates, followed by the generic one; the worst was the random explainer. To\nfurther validate the results and verify that the improvements of the intelligent explainer\nover the baselines are statistically signiﬁcant, we performed one-sided Mann-Whitney\nU-tests (a non-parametric version of the t-test for independent samples) whose results\nare summarized in Fig. 6. Results clearly show that, assuming P<.05 is enough\nto assert statistical signiﬁcance, the intelligent explainer is superior to the baselines\nregarding perceived explanatory power in all three chosen topics. For more details onstatistical tests, see Appendix B.\nInterestingly, looking at the topics separately, we also have statistical evidence\nshowing that the intelligent explainer is better than the generic and the random\nexplainer for the ﬁrst two topics, but not enough statistical evidence for the last one.\n123\n\n--- Page 23 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 1009\nTable 2 Questions used during the experiment. This table shows the questions extracted from the three\nexplainers of the experiment. Speciﬁcally, “intelligent” stands for the Intelligent Explanation Generator,\n“generic” is the Y A4Hu explainer, and “random” is the explainer that uses random questions. Note that an\nexplainer uses fewer than four questions (the maximum) for its explanations whenever it does not ﬁnd fourquestions with relevant answers in the knowledge graph.

Alternatively (and more likely), this may\nalso be because the explanations about the last topic were extracted from a corpus of\nlegal cases rather than textbooks or other educational contents as the other two, thus\nbeing harder to explain. In particular, this intuition is corroborated by the statistics ofTable 1, where one can see that the legal cases have a ratio of explained concepts close\nto 0.32%. In contrast, the textbook and web pages have 2.96% (10 times greater). This\ndifference in explainability between the two documents corpora may impact the qual-ity of extracted explanations. Indeed, as pointed out by some qualitative feedback, the\nexplanations extracted from the BV A cases contain too much (unexplained) technical\njargon and too long sentences (e.g., “the ﬁrst topic was easy to understand also the\nsecond one, the problem with the last one it was too long and was not straight to the\npoint.”).\nThis shows that the most useful implicit questions a user may have about a collection\nof texts will likely be those best answered by the whole collection. Furthermore, even\nif the random explanations have a cumulative pertinence score greater than generic\nexplanations (at least for the ﬁrst two topics, as shown in Table 2), they are evalu-\nated as worse explanations nonetheless. This evidence further supports Hypothesis 1,\nshowing that too speciﬁc archetypal questions may be less effective than generic onesat explaining and that intelligently balancing between generality and speciﬁcity is\nneeded, as also suggested by some qualitative feedback:\n•“All of the [random] explanations were OK, but improvement is needed. They lack\na sense of direction. It’s like they go around mountains to prove one single point.\n123\n\n--- Page 25 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 1011\nAll [generic] explanations were easy to decode and were straight to the point. All\n[intelligent] explanations were a mixture of ﬁrst and second explanations.”\n•“The [random explanations] proved unsatisfactory for all three topics: the expla-\nnations do not follow a logical order, are incomplete, and often contain incorrect or\nirrelevant elements. The [generic and intelligent explanations] are quite complete.\nThe [generic explanations] seem to ﬁt more practical questions, while [intelli-gent explanations] ﬁt more theoretical ones. I believe [intelligent explanations]\nare preferable for the topic at hand.”\nLimitationsandFutureWork\nOne limitation of our study pertains to its scope, encompassing both the duration\nof the study and the number of participants involved. Speciﬁcally, the study wasconducted over a brief 10-minute period and comprised a relatively small group of\n102 individuals. This restricted scope raises concerns regarding the generalizability of\nour ﬁndings. Furthermore, our research primarily concentrated on participant ratingsand qualitative feedback, without directly measuring changes in learning outcomes.\nAs a result, while our results offer initial insights into the potential applications of\neducational tools like Y AI4Edu, they should be approached with caution. In order tovalidate and expand upon these preliminary ﬁndings, it is necessary to conduct more\ncomprehensive studies over longer time-frames, involving larger and more diverse\nparticipant groups. However, previous research (Sovrano and Vitali, 2022a ) provides\ncompelling evidence supporting the notion that user-centered illocution signiﬁcantly\nenhances the effectiveness of Y AI software, leading to more efﬁcient explanations and\nimproved learning outcomes, as suggested also by qualitative feedback.\nIt is worth noting that even though qualitative feedback was optional, a notable 81%\nof users provided feedback. Interestingly, 19 participants left highly positive feedback\n(e.g., “the explanations were superb and of good quality”) without suggesting any\nimprovement or explaining their rates, unlike the remaining 64 users. Overall, we\nidentiﬁed 6 major suggestions for improvement :\n•Avoid long and redundant explanations : suggested by 32 participants;\n•Avoid or explain legal jargon : 24;\n•Avoid generic or incomplete information : 18;\n•Use simpler questions :9 ;\n•Provide examples when explaining :7 ;\n•Provide better organized and compartmentalized contents :5 .\nThe complaints were primarily about too-long explanations, unexplained legal jar-\ngon, or generic/incomplete information. Some qualitative feedback comments ask for\nmore conciseness, and others for less. Some participants preferred generic explana-\ntions over intelligent ones. Interestingly, one could turn this into a feature if the system\ncould offer users a choice of generic or intelligent explanations.\nThe qualitative feedback was extremely helpful in identifying the main problems\nand limitations of Y AI4Edu and the baselines, pointing to future work. In particular,we believe Y AI4Edu’s smart annotation mechanism can partially mitigate the jargon\n123\n\n--- Page 26 ---\n1012 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\nproblem by explaining it. However, we could not verify this with the experiment\nbecause it was set to take 10 minutes, so intelligent annotations were excluded. See\nAppendix Afor more details on qualitative feedback.\nFeedback has also indicated that Y AI4Edu could signiﬁcantly improve in terms\nof efﬁciently integrating retrieved information into a coherent structure. As it stands,\nexplanations often tend to be lengthy, repetitive, and disjointed. The introduction ofgenerative AI like ChatGPT might serve as a valuable solution to these issues, re-\nelaborating the information retrieved by Y AI4Edu. Indeed, ChatGPT has the potential\nto produce content that is not only concise and coherent but also well-organized. Itcan adeptly avoid or interpret complex (legal) jargon, presenting content in a well-\nstructured and compartmentalized manner. These features could address at least three\nout of the six primary improvement areas identiﬁed in the qualitative feedback. As aresult, the integration of such AI technology could signiﬁcantly enhance the effective-\nness of Y AI4Edu, as shown in Sovrano et al. ( 2023 ).\nIt should be noted, however, that while ChatGPT can complement Y AI4Edu, it\ncannot fully replace it. There are unique challenges associated with using large lan-\nguage models like ChatGPT to generate explanations from input documents, such\nas textbooks. These challenges include memory limitations and the risk of generat-\ning inaccurate or copyrighted content. Unlike ChatGPT, Y AI4Edu primarily relies on\ninformation retrieval technologies, eliminating the need to input the entire contextof the explanation into the language model. This is particularly important also for\nstandard-sized textbooks, where memory constraints can easily become an issue, as\ndiscussed in the study by Sovrano et al. ( 2023 ).\nFuture studies also need to focus on several factors to secure more robust results.\nFirst, we need further investigation into the effectiveness of our random explanations\ngenerator as a baseline. Given the feedback regarding redundant explanations and theneed for better-organized content, exploring sophisticated alternatives like ChatGPT\nmight provide a stronger baseline for comparison with Y AI4Edu.\nSecond, our research did not integrate commonsense and domain-general knowl-\nedge into the Y AI pipeline, making the system highly dependent on well-written,\nlogically coherent texts. This dependency sets a high standard for the source text, poten-\ntially limiting the extensibility of our work. Addressing this concern might be possiblewith the help of large language models, such as ChatGPT, which could potentially excel\nin tasks similar to Y AI4Edu. This holds particularly true for unstructured texts and\nthose not professionally written, offering promising avenues for future research.\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we presented Y AI4Edu, an Explanatory AI for the automatic generationof interactive and adaptive e-books for education. To create Y AI4Edu, we enhanced the\nY AI proposed by Sovrano and Vitali ( 2022b ), making it more explanatory and more\nintelligent through a novel AI, called Intelligent Explanation Generator, for extractingexplanations that are neither too speciﬁc nor too generic.\n123\n\n--- Page 27 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 1013\nThe idea behind our work is that explaining is akin to question answering, so the\nmore questions an intelligent textbook can answer, the more it can explain. In other\nwords, the explanatory power of a book can be improved by reorganizing it interac-tively, ﬁrstly to help readers identify the most critical questions to be answered about\nthe textbook, but also to get answers to their questions. In particular, Y AI4Edu uses\nthe Intelligent Explanation Generator, an efﬁcient pipeline for automatic (archetypal)question extraction and answer retrieval, to select these important questions and use\nthem to reorganize the contents of a textbook. This is done following Hypothesis 1\nfor which the most useful questions a user may have about a collection of texts (e.g.,a textbook) are best answered in the collection as a whole.\nWe applied Y AI4Edu to a textbook for teaching how to write legal memoranda\nappropriate for the U.S. legal system and a PTSD disability claim. This was integratedwith 5,406 external web pages from a legal encyclopedia and 11,198 legal cases from\nthe Board of Veterans’ Appeals. Then, to show that our novel strategy for generating\nexplanations is more effective than baseline approaches, we devised a within-subjectsuser study involving more than 100 English-speaking students who evaluated expla-\nnations about three different and relevant topics. The ﬁnal results were in many cases\nstatistically signiﬁcant and always in favor of our Intelligent Explanation Generator,\nsuggesting that Hypothesis 1is true.\nThe impact of our Y AI software pipeline extends to various sectors, including educa-\ntion, professional training, and industry. Within the education sector, our tool enhances\nthe use of textbooks by seamlessly integrating external content, facilitating efﬁcient\nexploration and retrieval of information through answer retrieval mechanisms. In pro-fessional training, it has the potential to elucidate complex concepts and procedures,\nthereby expediting knowledge acquisition, particularly in highly technical domains.\nIn the industrial context, our tool can simplify technical documentation and improvecustomer support, as suggested by Sovrano and Vitali ( 2022b ); Sovrano et al. ( 2023 ).\nLooking ahead, we foresee a notable shift in education with interactive e-books\nand AI-generated content supplementing or replacing traditional textbooks. Thesetools promise personalized, up-to-date learning experiences. Rather than replacing\neducators, these AI tools could augment their capabilities by providing personalized\ninstruction at scale. They could explain basic concepts and answer common questions,thus allowing educators to focus on more complex topics, critical thinking, creativity,\nand personalized guidance.\nAppendixAExperimentDetails\nThe experiment consisted of a 10-minute within-subjects user study where the\nexplanations generated by two baseline explainers and Y AI4Edu were evaluated byEnglish-speaking students assembled with Proliﬁc\n31, an online platform that helps\nrecruit paid participants for online research.\nThrough Proliﬁc, we gathered 130 participants, all students aged between 19 and\n38, each paid £1. 28 of the participants were discarded for the following reasons:\n31https://www.proliﬁc.co\n123\n\n--- Page 28 ---\n1014 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\n•26 participants were discarded because they were too quick (i.e., they spent less\nthan 4 minutes completing the evaluation of all topics) or they skipped at least one\ntopic (i.e., they spent less than 35 seconds on it without being a legal expert);\n•2 participants were rejected because they reported poor knowledge of written\nEnglish (i.e., A1 or A2) or wrote non-grammatical qualitative feedback.\nEventually, 102 valid submissions were collected.\nOf these 102 participants:\n•46 were males, 52 females, 1 identiﬁed itself as other/non-binary, and three pre-\nferred not to say;\n•81% stated that their written English proﬁciency level is C1 or C2, while 16%\nindicated a B2 level;\n•86% rated their knowledge of the U.S. legal system with a score lower than or\nequal to 3;\n•86 said they are not legal experts;\n•68 reported that they have low or no experience with legal writing, 29 wrote they\nhave some experience, and ﬁve that their experience with legal writing is high.\nParticipants were required to be ﬂuent in English, be resident in English-speaking\ncountries (i.e., USA, UK, Ireland, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa), usea device with a large screen (e.g., a laptop, a desktop computer, a tablet in landscape\nmode), be at least 18 years old, and possess a student status and a minimum approval\nrating of 75% on Proliﬁc.\nMoreover, at the beginning of the study, they were asked to provide the following\ninformation anonymously: age; gender; whether they are legal experts; their proﬁ-\nciency in written English, on a scale of A1 (very low) to C2 (very high); their experiencein legal writing (from none tohigh ); how they would rate their knowledge of the U.S.\nlegal system on a scale of 0 (bad) to 5 (good) stars.\nIt is important to note that during the experiment, for each topic, each participant\ncould compare the explanations generated by all three explainers, provided in random\norder to avoid unwanted biases that might be caused by some explanations being shown\nbefore or after others. Furthermore, using a predeﬁned random seed, the explanationsgenerated by the random explainer were the same for all participants.\nIn the experiment, participants were not informed about the origin of the expla-\nnations they evaluated, speciﬁcally whether they came from random, generic, orintelligent generators, nor were they made aware of the existence of these three dif-\nferent generators. Each explanation was to be evaluated on a 0 to 5-star scale, with\n0 representing “bad” and 5 indicating “good”, as depicted in Fig. 5. Once the testing\nwas completed, participants were also invited to share their qualitative feedback in an\nopen-ended format.\nSome of the most interesting feedback examples are the following:\n•“The more lengthy explanations offer more details and give the reader a greater\nunderstanding but can feel a bit harder to read rather than the [generic explana-tions].”\n•“Dividing the topic into sections is good if the [questions] are relevant and make\nsense. Relatively simple explanations supported by evidence are better, in myopinion.”\n123\n\n--- Page 29 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 1015\n•“The longer explanations were more detailed and more understandable. The shorter\ndeﬁnitions were also understandable and compact, but the law should be detailed.\n”\n•“I particularly liked the layout that included ’what, why, how’, as it made the\nexplanations easy to follow. [...] The headings with long sentences lost me before\nI began, and I found it hard to decipher the explanations.”\n•“I would make [explanations] shorter.”\n•“The answers should be less vague and focus more on details.”\n•“The explanations with very long or involved subheadings were difﬁcult to follow.\nOften, when there are large blocks of text, my mind tends to get overwhelmed\n- simply making shorter subheadings and adding more paragraph breaks to the\nexplanations helps with this.”\n•“The answers to the questions could have been more concise, for instance, in\nthe ﬁrst topic on what a memorandum is, though I found [intelligent] and [generic\nexplanations] to be similar in their verbiage. I found [generic explanations] alwayseasier to understand across the board. Because of its simplistic presentation, I did\nnot spend time focusing on unnecessary details”\n•“The explanations are a bit difﬁcult to follow as they are long, so as a reader, you\nget lost in the middle of the explanation and forget what you just read on top.”\n•“They were pretty straightforward and easy to understand, especially because\ndescriptions relating to the law or topics that are difﬁcult to understand are always\nﬁlled with difﬁcult jargon, but this simpliﬁed version made it easy to understand.”\n•“Generally, the explanations were full but a bit difﬁcult to digest. There were cases\nin which not enough was explained to fully understand what a speciﬁc legal term\nmeant and encompassed. The explanations that had a short and quick explanation\nof some legal terms followed by a more prolonged and detailed explanation were,for me, the easiest to grasp.”\nAppendixBStatisticalTests\nComplementing Fig. 6, Table 3provides the extended results of Mann-Whitney U-tests\nconducted on three different comparisons: Random vs Generic, Random vs Intelligent,\nand Generic vs Intelligent. We carried out these tests both on the aggregate data acrossall three topics (memorandum, disability, elements of legal standard), and on each topic\nindividually. For each comparison, the results include the U statistic, the p-value, the\nCommon Language Effect Size (CLES), and the Rank-biserial Correlation.\nThe interpretation of the results across all three topics reveals a consistent pattern.\nOn the whole, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference favoring the Generic over the Random\ngroup, and the Intelligent group over the Random group. The effect sizes of thesedifferences range from small to medium, as indicated by the Common Language\nEffect Size and Rank-biserial Correlation. The differences between the Generic and\nIntelligent groups are also signiﬁcant, albeit smaller.\nWhen it comes to the speciﬁc topic of “Memorandum”, there is no notable difference\nbetween the Random and Generic groups. However, both the Random and Generic\n123\n\n--- Page 30 ---\n1016 Int J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021\nTable 3 Effect Size of Statistical Tests.

This ﬁgure contains bar charts showing the average scores and the statistically\nsigniﬁcant Pvalues (indicated above the curly brackets) for each topic and explainer. For a list of all P\nvalues, see Table 3. On the left side of the ﬁgure, one can see the results obtained by aggregating the scores\nfor all three topics. In particular, the bar plot labeled as “memorandum” refers to the ﬁrst topic, “disability”\nto the second topic, and “elements of legal standard” to the third topic\n123\n\n--- Page 31 ---\nInt J Artif Intell Educ (2025) 35:987–1021 1017\nIntelligent groups, with small effect sizes. The Generic and Intelligent groups are also\nvery similar in performance.\nIn all, while we see some variation by topic, the overarching pattern is that the\nIntelligent group consistently outperforms the Random group, and the Generic group\nfalls somewhere in between.\nSince we are performing multiple comparisons with Mann-Whitney U-tests, the\nchances of a false comparison increase. Some statistical tools that are used in this case\nto reduce the chance of a type I error (false positive) are: the Bonferroni correction,\nthe Holm-Bonferroni method, or the Dunn-Šidák correction. These tools, however,are known to increase false negatives (Armstrong, 2014 ). Regardless, if we would\nuse a Dunn-Šidák correction to adjust for 3 multiple comparisons per topic, then the\nminimum Pvalue for claiming a statistically signiﬁcant result would not be .05 but\ninstead something close to .017.\nNevertheless, the collected ﬁndings still support Hypothesis 1. As shown in Fig. 6\nand Table 3,m a n y Pvalues are much less than .017.\nAcknowledgements We thank the copyright holders of (Brostoff and Sinsheimer, 2013 ) for allowing us to\nuse (parts of) the book to conduct the experiments, carry out the case study and present this article.\nAuthor Contributions F .

Foltz and Chelsea Chandler\n27.1 Language as a Window into Cognitive Functioning\nThe evaluation of cognitive and functional abilities in individuals is critical in many \ndomains, such as education, psychology, psychiatry, and neurology. Indeed, language is \none of the primary modalities for psychological assessments, both through standardized \nassessments and through structured interviews. Verbal communication patterns and con -\ntent offer a wealth of information that can be linked to a person’s overall mental state, \nknowledge, cognitive abilities, and ability to function well in social situations. Take, for \nexample, this notable and classic example of disordered language from Andreasen’s Scale \nfor the Assessment of Thought, Language, and Communication (TLC) ( Andreasen, 1986 , \np. 477).\nInterviewer:  Um, what do you think about current political issues like the energy crisis?\nPatient:  They’re destroying too many cattle and oil just to make soap. If we need soap \nwhen you can jump into a pool of water, and then when you go to buy your \ngasoline, m-  my folks always thought they should, get pop but the best thing \nto get, is motor oil, and, money…\nWhile the patient’s response is related to the question posed by the interviewer, it meanders \noff the topic, uses unusual combinations of words, and is not very coherent. Patients with \nbrain disorders may exhibit several features of language, such as poverty of content, \ndistractible speech, tangentiality, derailment, stilted speech, loss of goals, and persever -\nation, among others, which can provide signals of types and severity of disorders. Clinicians \nare trained to pick up on these signals which can then help with diagnosis and treatments. \nHowever, evaluation is a complex, subjective, and expensive process when performed by \nhumans. A high prevalence of neuropsychological disorders require patients to physic -\nally visit a doctor’s office for screening and assessments, leading to healthcare accessibility \nissues which can contribute to unequal access to services and inequity. Furthermore, human \ncognitive and mental states are dynamic over time and context but in-  person traditional  \n  \n \n  \n\n--- Page 2 ---\nComputational Language Analysis\n557assessment methods primarily afford cross-  sectional snap-  shots in time due to the required \nin- person attendance for clinical interviews, neuropsychological testing, brain scanning, \nand other sorts of invasive testing ( Chandler et al., 2020c ). Automated techniques can be \nharnessed to reduce language to sets of computational features which analyze semantic, \nsyntactic, and speech properties to characterize these signals, enhancing the efficiency and \naccuracy in assessment. Thus, there is strong utility in applying computational language \nprocessing as digital biomarkers for the purpose of psychological assessment.\n27.1.1  Computational Measurement of Language:  \nCognition, Affect, and Social States\nVerbal communication is a complex task affected by many cognitive skills, as well as mental \nand physical brain pathologies. Distinct brain regions contribute to the progression of speech, \nbeginning with the generation of thoughts and translation to linguistic expressions, and cul -\nminating in the delivery of each utterance ( Dronkers & Ogar, 2004 ; Hoffman, 1987 ). Given \nthat speech is the medium through which signs and symptoms of brain function and dys -\nfunction are manifested, the evaluation of language can be seen as a window into different \ntypes of cognitive, social, and affective functioning. Recent advancements in speech signal \nprocessing, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning (ML) modeling have \nspurred the development of tools capable of detecting these aspects of mental and cognitive \nwell-  being, as well as affect and social states. This line of work relies on extracting features \nfrom recorded and transcribed (or written) speech and language to objectively assess these \ndimensions of functioning, enable earlier detection of disorders, and track progression and \nchange in well-  being over time.\n27.1.2  Historical Perspectives on Language for Clinical  \nAssessment of Serious Mental Illness\nSerious mental illness (SMI) is characterized by serious cognitive functional impairment \nand encompasses multiple types of illnesses, such as schizophrenia, major depression, \nand bipolar disorders (e.g., Cohen et al., 2014 ). Analysis of discourse in SMI and cog -\nnitive decline have shown significant changes in the quantity, quality, and expression of \nlanguage production. These changes are used as part of diagnostic criteria by clinicians. \nUnderstanding these aspects of language in measurable ways requires indexing the changes \nin language features. A feature can be any statistical or NLP-  derived measure of aspects of \nthe amount and quality of type of language produced by someone. Basic features can be \ncounts of types of words, while more complicated features may be measures of semantic \ncoherence across a discourse, or variability in types of emotions being expressed. While \nindications of SMI through language have been known for years (e.g., Bleuler, 1911 ), work \nin the 1980s was the first to obtain reliable  and objective  measures of language deviance \nand thought disorder, such as type-  token ratios and readability measures (e.g., Manschreck \net al., 1981 ). Snowdon et al. (1996)  manually evaluated the autobiographical essays of \nAmerican Roman Catholic nuns who shared relatively homogeneous characteristics (e.g., \nno drug use and similar living situations) to extract metrics such as grammatical complexity \nand idea density (e.g., number of ideas per N words). In this study, an absence of linguistic \nstructure and complexity was a significant predictor of diminished cognitive ability or the \ndevelopment of Alzheimer’s disease later in life. While these studies were conducted before  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 3 ---\nPeter W. Foltz and Chelsea Chandler\n558the availability of significant computing power and the ability to easily collect data in elec -\ntronic form, they indicate the usefulness of computationally identifying linguistic features \nand linking them to indicators related to SMI.\nStarting in the early 2000s, the area of computational modeling of discourse in mental \nhealth began to grow. The growth has been enabled by ongoing advances in NLP-  based \nmethods, increased computing power, and the wide availability of mobile devices for data \ncollection. It has been further enabled by the recognition of how such approaches can \nisolate the underlying mechanisms of serious mental illnesses (e.g., Cohen et al., 2014 ; \nElvevåg et al., 2017 ) in line with the integrative and dimensional transdiagnostic approach \nof the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria as well as \nthe greater need for efficient and effective means for monitoring patients. As the field has \nmatured, it has examined mental states in structured language, such as verbal recalls, as \nwell as more unstructured language such as social media posts and personal diaries, and \nhas been evaluated on data from a wide range of clinical areas including schizophrenia and \npsychosis (e.g., Elvevåg et al., 2007 ; Morgan et al., 2021 ), cognitive decline (e.g., Diaz-  Asper \net al., 2022 ; Fraser et al., 2015 ), suicidality ( Roy et al., 2020 ), depression (e.g., Mahdy et \nal., 2020 ), and drug use disorders ( Agurto et al., 2023 ). For reviews, see Corcoran and \nCecchi (2020 ), Goharian et al. (2021 ), and Zhang et al. (2022 ). This chapter provides an \noverview of a common technical approach to the analysis of language for assessing mental \nhealth processes, describes research on areas related to clinical assessment, and concludes \nwith a discussion of implications and caveats for applying the technologies.\n27.2 Underlying Technology and Goals for Assessment of  \nCognitive Functioning\n27.2.1  Overarching Purpose and a Generalized Architecture\nOverall, natural language and speech processing for clinical assessment provides a  \npowerful means to uncover underlying cognitive, social, and affective factors, enhancing  \nour understanding of human functioning and supporting the development of interventions  \nand support systems for individuals in need. NLP techniques enable the extraction and  \nanalysis of spoken and written information, allowing researchers and practitioners to delve  \ninto the intricacies of, and disorders in, language production and comprehension. This  \napproach facilitates the assessment of cognitive processes such as attention, memory, and  \nproblem-  solving abilities, as well as detection of potential disorders and changes in patient  \nmental states. While there exist a broad range of application areas, across disorders and  \ntypes of data collected, the analysis techniques remain highly consistent. Here we describe  \na generalized architecture for such tools (see Figure 27.1 ).\nFigure 27.1   A Generalized Architecture of NLP and Speech Processing as a Window into Cognition. \n \n  \n   \n   \n  \n   \n\n--- Page 4 ---\nComputational Language Analysis\n559The typical analysis pipeline starts with gathering language data –   often with the use \nof automated speech recognition which converts spoken language to text –   which is then \nannotated and preprocessed for an experiment’s objective. Next, researchers may take two \ndistinct modeling routes: using an end-  to- end model or deriving features that may align \nwith known constructs and training a model directly on the features. End-  to- end ML mod -\neling involves training a model that learns directly from raw data to make predictions, \neliminating the need for manual feature engineering. In this case, either raw speech or \ntext is harnessed as direct input and models are trained (or fine-  tuned) to predict labels of \ninterest. For example, deep neural networks tend to be harnessed in an end-  to- end fashion. \nIn contrast, feature-  based ML modeling requires the selection and engineering of relevant \nfeatures from the raw data before training the model. Support Vector Machines (SVMs), \ndecision trees, regression, and K-  nearest neighbors are some common model architectures \nfor feature-  based ML. NLP and speech features are extracted to measure the constructs of \ninterest, and statistical analyses or ML approaches are used to select the most predictive \nones. In general, to train and test models, datasets are split into train, test, and validation \nsets, or if the dataset is small, k-  fold cross-  validation is typically used iteratively (often \nwithout an additional held-  out test set). After determining the best features, model types, \nand parameters, accuracy statistics are calculated and reported, and actionable inferences \ncan be made. It should be noted that this analysis pipeline is not highly different from those \nused for educational assessment of writing or speaking. The key differences though may \nbe the kinds of NLP features used to assess language (e.g., disfluencies, coherence, and \ntangentiality) and that the models are trained on signals such as detecting presence versus \nabsence of particular diagnostic categories (e.g., depression and thought disorder).\n27.2.2  Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\nAfter speech samples are obtained through a speech elicitation task, which may include pas -\nsively collected speech, standard or spontaneous interviews and conversations, thorough \nneuropsychological batteries, or by simply recording the collaboration between teammates, \nthe speech must be transcribed for NLP techniques to be applied. Automatic speech rec -\nognition (ASR) or manual transcription methods are used to convert spoken words to \ntheir textual equivalents. ASR technologies include commercial tools such as Microsoft \nAzure Speech Service (learn.microsoft.com/  en- us/ azure/  cognitive-  services/  speech-  service/  ), \nGoogle Speech API (cloud.google.com/  speech-  to- text/ ), Amazon Transcribe (aws.amazon.\ncom/  transcribe/  ), and IBM Watson ( www.ibm.com/  cloud/  wat son- spe ech- to- text/ ), as well \nas open source tools such as Whisper ASR ( Radford et al., 2022 ), Kaldi ( Povey et al., \n2011 ), and pre-  trained wav2vec models ( Baevski et al., 2020 ). Typically ASR performance \nis evaluated by the Word Error Rate (WER) based on the Levenshtein distance, where the \nnumber of insertions (incorrect words inserted in the output), deletions (missing words in \nthe output), and substitutions (mismatched words between the output and the reference) \nare counted and then divided by the total number of words in the reference transcript.\nMany factors must be considered when choosing an appropriate ASR tool for their \napplication. The accuracy of these tools differs by the domains in which they are applied \nas well as the population studied (e.g., where racial and age disparities have been shown; \nKoenecke et al., 2020 ; Werner et al., 2019 ). In applications that analyze confidential speech \ndata, such as those that contain personally identifiable information, one must consider the \nsecurity protocols of their chosen tool. For instance, open-  source tools have the advantage \nof being able to run locally, without having to send speech data to the “cloud.” Once the  \n  \n \n   \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nPeter W. Foltz and Chelsea Chandler\n560language is transcribed, it may be preprocessed before applying feature extraction methods. \nPreprocessing decisions tend to be task and feature dependent, meaning that in some cases \nthe language must be processed before analyses are performed, but in other cases, the raw \nlanguage is sufficient. Standard approaches to preprocessing may include tokenization, \nlemmatization, stemming, removal of stop words and/  or punctuation, and converting text \nto lowercase. It is important to take note of all preprocessing steps taken, both for repro -\nducibility purposes and to ensure that data is formatted in the same manner when testing \nthe models on new data.\n27.2.3  Language and Speech Feature Extraction with a  \nFocus on Several Specific Measures\nThe language features that are typically extracted for psychological assessments can be \ngrouped into three distinct classes of NLP approaches with increasing complexity: first-  \norder lexeme-  level, syntactic, and semantic features. These classes of features further cor -\nrespond to aspects of language that may be differentially affected by mental disorders. \nGenerally, syntactic and lexeme levels of errors may be more associated with aphasias. \nSemantic features are more associated with schizophrenia, affective disorders (e.g., depres -\nsion and bipolar disorder), and cognitive decline (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease and mild cog -\nnitive impairment). Thus, the types of language features chosen must be considered in \nthe development of assessment models. Furthermore, derived acoustic and speech timing \ncharacteristics may provide additional insights to cognitive health.\n27.2.3.1  Lexeme-  Level Features\nFirst-  order lexeme-  level features encompass basic measurements of language at the word \nlevel such as word token counts and word type counts (i.e., unique words) as well as more \nsophisticated measurements of lexical diversity, which assay the amount of unique vocabu -\nlary used in language. This includes metrics like type-  to- token ratio (TTR), content density \n(CD), propositional density (P-  density), Honoré’s Statistic (HS), and Brunet’s Index (BI) \n(e.g., Voletiet al., 2019 ). Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) is a well-  known set \nof tools that provide counts of over 100 features of texts and have been used widely for \nmeasuring emotional expression, detecting depression, and relating psychological aspects \nto natural language use (see Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010 ). For instance, research has \nshown that LIWC analyses can classify those with mild cognitive impairment from healthy \ncontrols with 80% accuracy ( Asgari et al., 2017 ).\nWhile counting tokens can be predictive of mental state, it’s worth noting that certain \nfeatures, such as TTR, can be heavily influenced by text length, as longer utterances tend to \nyield higher scores. CD, HS, and BI, on the other hand, demonstrate a weaker dependency \non text length. Therefore, the choice of which features to utilize depends greatly on the \nspecific task. For example, if speech length is considered an aspect of language that should \nbe modeled and heavily taken into account, TTR may be more advantageous over CD as it \ncaptures the quantity of language produced. First-  order lexeme-  level features offer simpli -\ncity, interpretability, and ease of computation. However, they do not provide insights into \nlanguage unit structure, complexity, or the context of the semantic meaning generated by \npatients. \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 6 ---\nComputational Language Analysis\n561Features derived from part-  of- speech tags are also an important word-  level feature. \nIndividual word tokens can be automatically assigned their corresponding part-  of- speech \nlabels by commonly using the Penn Treebank tags ( Marcus et al., 1993 ). These automatic \ntaggers generally use statistical models to assign tags to language. Once language is tagged, \nsimple counts and frequencies of these tags, as well as more sophisticated metrics such as \nP- density and CD, provide insights into the relative distribution of different types of words. \nResearch has shown that the use of features derived from part-  of- speech tags (such as CD) \ncan be used as input to ML models to classify those with mild cognitive impairment from \nhealthy controls with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.732 ( Roark et al., 2011 ).\n27.2.3.2  Syntactic Features\nSentence-  level syntactic features constitute a more intricate type of language feature, cap -\nturing aspects of how well a person can generate language that is both grammatically \ncorrect and shows aspects of complexity. This category may encompass metrics derived \nfrom dependency parses or speech graphs of language. Dependency parses capture the \nrelationships between words in a sentence, such as words that modify one another. On the \nother hand, speech graphs employ networks to represent words, with nodes representing \nwords and edges illustrating temporal relationships between them. Metrics derived from \nthese representations include the depth of dependencies (distance) in parse trees or the count \nof nodes, edges, or loops (connectedness) in speech graphs ( Yngve, 1960 ; Frazier, 1985 ). \nResearchers have proposed such a graph theory approach for analyzing language structure \nto measure symptoms of thought disorder within psychosis ( Mota et al., 2012 ; Mota et al., \n2014 ). While syntactic features offer a more robust assessment of language proficiency \ncompared to lexemes alone, the generation of sentence parses and graphs introduces add -\nitional complexity and potential sources of error in automated models.\n27.2.3.3  Semantic Features\nA hallmark of the disruptions in language in SMI occurs in the expression of meaning. \nThis can include aspects such as the topicality of responses, the coherence, and the density \nof relevant ideas. The crux of automated semantic analysis lies in the utilization of high-  \ndimensional vector space word embeddings of text. These embeddings operate under the \npremise that the meaning of a word can be derived from the context in which it typically \nappears, or that “you shall know a word by the company it keeps” ( Firth, 1957 ). As a \nresult, semantically related words –   or those that tend to appear in similar contexts –   should \nbe close to one another in their derived vector spaces. Various word embedding techniques \nexist, including Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA; Landauer & Dumais, 1997 ; Landauer \net al., 1998 ), word2vec ( Mikolov et al., 2013 ), Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo; \nPeters et al., 2018 ), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT; \nDevlin et al., 2019 ), XLNet ( Yang et al., 2019 ), and GPT ( Brown et al., 2020 ). It should \nbe noted that this field is rapidly evolving and newer models continue to be developed with \nadditional gains in accuracy. Generally, cosine distance metrics, computed between con -\nsecutive embeddings or windows of embeddings, are used as features in ML  models, but \nfor techniques like ELMo, BERT, XLNet, and GPT, the entire network can be leveraged and \nfine- tuned to produce metrics and predictions. \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n    \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nPeter W. Foltz and Chelsea Chandler\n562With real-  valued vector representations of words, phrases, sentences, and entire \nparagraphs, it is possible to quantify notions of typical semantic language usage, such as \nthe content of the language, as well as coherence and tangentially which are measures of flu -\nidity. For example, the coherence of a response can be measured by computing the semantic \nsimilarity of consecutive windows of words to the next windows of words (see Elvevåg \net al., 2007 ; Foltz et al., 1998 ). The topicality can be measured by looking at the semantic \nsimilarity of a patient’s response to the question asked or to previously annotated responses \ngiven by other people.\n27.2.3.4  Speech Signal Features\nAcoustic characteristics of speech can also provide valuable insights into cognitive \nfunctioning, such as a patient’s affective state (e.g., Cheng et al., 2018 ). Various acoustic \nfeatures can be easily extracted using tools like openSMILE ( Eyben et al., 2010 ). These \nfeatures encompass energy, loudness, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Perceptual \nLinear Prediction, the fundamental frequency F0, probability of voicing, voice quality \nmeasures like jitter and shimmer, formant frequencies and bandwidth (F1, F2, F3, F4, etc.), \nas well as harmonics-  to- noise ratio. Additionally, aggregated statistics of these features, \nincluding means, extremes, moments, segments, peaks, linear and quadratic regression, \npercentiles, durations, onsets, and more, can be calculated. For example, research has \nshown that high levels of stress were associated with abnormally small changes in vocal \nexpression within those with a variety of psychiatric symptoms but for those with no active \npsychiatric symptoms, stress levels had more typical effects on voice modulation ( Cohen \net al., 2019 ). Timing mechanisms also play a crucial role in evaluating mental and cognitive \nstates. Generalized slowing is a prominent symptom observed in various psychiatric and \nneurodegenerative conditions. To capture the phenomenon of slowing in speech, timing-  \nrelated features can be utilized, including the length and rate of voiced segments, silent \npauses, the rate and fluctuations of voiced segments to pauses, and measures of rhythm \n(e.g., Pressman et al., 2019 ). A meta-  analysis assessed how timing delays affect cognitive \nprocesses in those with schizophrenia and concluded that tasks which require selective \nattention had the most slowing (2.3 times slower for those with schizophrenia), followed \nby lexical tasks (1.8 times slower), and lastly non-  lexical tasks (1.4 times slower) ( Schatz, \n1998 ). These features may provide a more direct assessment of illness compared to other \nderived acoustic measurements that may align more with other factors such as medications \nor physical differences.\n27.2.4  Training Feature-  Based Machine Learning Models\nOnce features are extracted from the language and speech signal, ML models are trained \nto predict dependent variables of interest. In essence, the goal is to relate the targeted cog -\nnitive functions to the language and speech features that indicate them. ML models gen -\nerally fall into two categories: regression and classification models –   usually performed in \na supervised manner, meaning that models learn from labeled data as opposed to models \nlearning their own representations from unlabeled data (unsupervised learning). Regression \nmodels learn relationships between input variables (the features) and the corresponding \ncontinuous target variable (the dependent variable). Examples of regression tasks include \npredicting essay scores, clinician rating performance on neuropsychological tasks, general  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 8 ---\nComputational Language Analysis\n563patient ratings of well-  being, and dimensions of affect such as activation levels. Classification \ninvolves predicting the class or category to which a data instance belongs, where the model \nis trained to accurately assign class labels to new, unseen data instances. Typical classifica -\ntion methods include logistic regression, decision trees, and SVMs. The output of a clas -\nsification model is a discrete class label or a probability distribution over multiple classes, \neither represented as a binary task (two classes) or a multiclass classification task (more \nthan two classes). Examples of classification tasks include detecting the onset of cognitive \ndecline or psychiatric disorders, predicting diagnostic labels, as well as detecting students at \nrisk. In both approaches, the model tries to find the best-  fitting mathematical function that \napproximates the relationship between the input variables and the target variable.\n27.3 Research and Applications Applying Language Analysis to  \nMeasuring Mental Health\nThis section illustrates how the NLP and ML pipeline has been applied in a few areas for \nassessing cognitive functioning. The examples represent a subset of approaches currently \nbeing performed. For more examples, see Clarke et al. (2020) , Corcoran and Cecchi (2020) , \nGoharian et al. (2021) , Zhang et al. (2022) , and Cecchi and Corcoran (2023) .\n27.3.1  Automating Traditional Neuropsychiatric Assessments\nTask-  driven speech may be elicited in many ways for neuropsychological purposes. Current \npsychiatric practice involves many standardized types of speech tasks which are hand-  \nscored by clinicians. For an overview of common neuropsychological assessment tasks, \nsee Lezak et al. (2012) , and for an overview of the use of ML and NLP for the automation \nof a subset of these tasks see Chandler et al. (2020c) . Here the focus is on two popular \ntasks: story recall and animal fluency. The purpose of the story recall task is to assess an \nindividual’s ability to comprehend and remember a story or narrative and is used to identify \nmemory deficits, monitor progress, and develop interventions or treatment plans. The task \ninvolves presenting a story to the participant through an auditory or written format. After \na brief period, the participant is asked to recall as much information as possible from the \nstory. The responses are then assessed based on their accuracy, completeness, and the level \nof detail provided. Automating this task involves (1) collecting human responses to a set of \nstory recall prompts as the set of training data for the scoring model; (2) harnessing ASR to \ntranscribe the spoken recalls and preprocessing the text data; (3) extracting features such \nas word token and type overlap, semantic similarity, and syntactic patterns; (4) training \nan ML model using these features and human-  assigned scores; (5) evaluating the model \nwith metrics such as mean squared error or Pearson’s correlation; and finally (6) applying \nsuch a model in real settings. Results show that these models can be quite accurate to \nmatching clinician ratings and are highly robust to word errors in ASR ( Chandler et al., \n2019 ; Holmlund et al., 2020 ).\nFluency tasks are used to test a person’s verbal fluency, executive functioning, and \nsemantic memory ( Shao et al., 2014 ). In the animal fluency task, the participant is given a \nspecific time limit and asked to generate as many animal names as possible within that time \nframe. Traditionally, this task is scored by simply tallying the number of unique examples \nspoken. This scoring process is easily automated with minimal effort. However, researchers \nhave proposed more detailed analyses that could provide additional insights into cognitive  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 9 ---\nPeter W. Foltz and Chelsea Chandler\n564processes. Troyer et al. (1997)  introduced an early improvement, suggesting two metrics that \ncapture important aspects of the task: clustering (producing words within the same subcat -\negory of animals, such as safari or house pets) and switching (changing between clusters). \nSuch features can be implemented with hard-  coded categories as supplied by the authors or \nwith the use of word embeddings. The latter involves computing cosine distances between \nthe word embeddings of each exemplar to determine if it belongs to the same category, or if \nthere is a switch to a new one based on a cosine distance threshold. This approach is prefer -\nable to a hard-  coded approach for several reasons. Hard-  coded categories may not consider \nsocietal influences or cultural variations in mental categorizations. For example, the sequence \n“lion, tiger, bear” may not constitute a mental switch –   due to the societal influence of the \nWizard of Oz, but it falls into two distinct Toyer categories. Cultural differences may result in \ndifferent animal responses such as respondents in Norway producing an overwhelming focus \non fish ( Rosenstein et al., 2015 ), which the Troyer categorizations do not account for. The \nhard-  coded approach lacks flexibility for handling animals outside the predefined categories, \nrelying on manual incorporation and introducing bias and non-  standardization, contrary to \nthe goal of full automation. Automating this task follows a similar pipeline as the story recall \ntask except that the features would align with the task more closely: such as unique animals, \ncategories, and switches, as well as semantic features such as average semantic distance \nbetween consecutive animals and average word embedding lengths ( Diaz-  Asper et al., 2022 ).\n27.3.2  Detecting Presence and Severity of Thought Disorder\nAn early investigation that applied computational assessments of language for the detec -\ntion of schizophrenia by Elvevåg et al. (2007)  used LSA word embeddings to measure \nsemantics of thought disorder. LSA coherence features were computed from transcripts of \nparticipants’ responses to various language tasks, such as single word associations, verbal \nfluency, and general interviews. These features were derived as cosine distances between \nLSA vector representations of source words and spoken words, consecutive words, and \nsliding windows of text (n-  grams) with sizes ranging from 2 to 8 words. It should be noted \nthat this same approach has been used for assessing student writing in essays (see Foltz, \net al., 1998 ; Foltz, 2020 ). Additionally, tangentiality, defined as the slope of a regression \nline fit to cosine distances over consecutive text windows with the same parameters, was \nalso extracted. With this set of computational features, the authors were able to accur -\nately assess direct levels of incoherence, as well as whether a given discourse belonged to a \npatient with schizophrenia or to a healthy control. Similar approaches have been used by \nIter et al., (2018)  and Bedi et al. (2015) , where coherence models were used to predict the \nfuture development of psychosis among a small group of psychiatric patients.\n27.3.3  Acoustic Features for Affective and Cognitive State Assessment\nA person’s emotions can be evident from the acoustic properties of their speech, indicating \naspects of mental state. Acoustic properties have been used in many fields for affect detec -\ntion, including in educational assessment such as for developing affect-  sensitive tutors (e.g., \nD’Mello et al., 2007 ). Acoustic features alone can serve as a measurement of patient mental \nstates, such as in the prediction of diagnoses in demographically matched datasets, the pre -\ndiction of self-  reported emotional affect ( Cheng et al., 2018 ), and expert ratings of patients’ \nemotional state. However, their utility is particularly evident when combined with language  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n\n--- Page 10 ---\nComputational Language Analysis\n565or emotional state variables. For instance, in a follow-  on study to Cheng et al. (2018) , \nChandler et al. (2020b)  showed that the unimodal acoustic analyses could be improved \nby combining with language features from spoken story recalls to predict a person’s self-  \nreported affect. Roark et al. (2011)  utilized acoustic and language features to detect mild \ncognitive impairment. They employed manual and automated methods to estimate speech \nduration features, including phonation rate, total phonation time, total pause time, pauses \nper sample, total locution time, and verbal rate. Fraser et al. (2015)  used a hybrid approach \nwith speech and language metrics to classify patients with Alzheimer’s disease and healthy \ncontrols. They considered over 370 distinctive features, including grammatical features, \nsyntactic complexity, information content, and acoustic features associated with patho -\nlogical speech. The combination of speech and linguistic features offers complementary \ninsights into disease progression and severity, leading to a comprehensive feature set for \nimproved classification results in many application areas.\n27.3.4  Detecting Onset of Cognitive Decline\nNumerous studies have documented the prevalence of speech differences between those \nwho experience healthy aging and cognitive decline disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease \nand mild cognitive impairment. As mentioned above, Roark et al. (2011)  and Fraser et al. \n(2015)  used traditional feature-  based ML methods in conjunction with both acoustic and \nlinguistic features to predict mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, respect -\nively. Other studies have focused on language alone for prediction as this modality has \nbeen shown to be the most predictive of cognitive decline ( König et al., 2015 ; Diaz-  Asper \net al., 2022 ). Researchers have even applied such methods to written responses to a pic -\nture description task, finding that telegraphic speech (i.e., simplified language), repetitive -\nness, and misspellings were indicative of future onset of AD ( Eyigoz et al., 2020 ). Notable \npublic figures like United States presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush have \neven been the subject of such analyses to assess the existence of differences in discourse \ncomplexity between Bush –   a healthy aging person –   and Reagan –   preceding his diagnoses \nof Alzheimer’s disease ( Berisha et al., 2015 ). For a review, see Ivanova et al. (2023) .\n27.3.5  Detection of Students at Risk\nA crossover point between educational assessment and clinical assessment has been research \ninto the detection of students at risk through their writing. A student at risk may be defined \nas one expressing thoughts of harm to self or others. While NLP tools have been broadly \napplied to assessing open-  ended writing in social media (see Coppersmith et al., 2018 ; \nNguyen et al., 2022 ), student essays, which are already being automatically assessed for \nwriting quality, can also be assessed for statements that may indicate sensitive issues of \nharm and distress. While the area of detection of crisis papers is still at the early stages, \neffective rubrics and methods are being developed that can help triage these papers for \nhuman review ( Burkardt et al., 2021 ).\n27.3.6  Applying Deep Learning Models for Mental Health Assessment\nAlthough traditional feature-  based ML models are highly regarded for their interpretability, \nthe advent of deep learning has revolutionized the fields of NLP and ML by significantly  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 11 ---\nPeter W. Foltz and Chelsea Chandler\n566improving accuracy across various applications. Deep learning models consist of intricate \nnetworks of interconnected nodes organized in layers, enabling hierarchical learning of \nincreasingly sophisticated data patterns. These models encompass numerous parameters, \nrequiring extensive training data to prevent overfitting and to acquire a generalized \nunderstanding of the training dataset. Particularly in complex domains, a substantial \nnumber of examples per class (i.e., target or dependent variable) are essential for effectively \ncapturing the underlying data patterns. There have been notable achievements in predictive \nmodeling that leverage electronic health records ( Miotto et al., 2016 ; Tran & Kavuluru, \n2017 ) and social media posts ( Gkotsis et al., 2017 ; Guntuku et al., 2017 ). These domains \noffer the advantage of facilitating data collection on a large scale.\nWithin the domain of cognitive decline detection, Orimaye et al. (2018)  developed a \ndeep learning cognitive assessment model, utilizing data from DementiaBank, to classify \nparticipants as having Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, or being cognitively \nhealthy from them describing a picture depicting a cookie theft. The model architecture \nincorporated both a deep neural network and deep language model. Their model achieved \nrelatively high accuracy; however, these accuracies align with those of other ML classifiers \nfor cognitive decline, suggesting that the additional complexity associated with neural \nnetworks may not have been necessary.\nThe application of deep neural network models extends to the utilization of passive \nbehavioral data collected from smartphones. Suhara et al. (2017)  successfully predicted \nsevere depressive states by leveraging a Long Short-  Term Memory (LSTM) neural network \ntrained on 2,382 individual histories of mood, behavioral logs, and sleep information. \nTheir model outperformed a comparable support vector machine-  based implementation. \nAdditionally, the authors highlighted that incorporating a user’s historical information \nenhanced the accuracy of forecasting future depressed moods.\n27.4 Ethical and Measurement Considerations\n27.4.1  What Are We Measuring?\nIt is straightforward to find NLP measures that can correlate with patients’ clinical states. \nFor example, patients with depression, Alzheimer’s disease, or schizophrenia all tend to \nproduce less language than controls. But a count of word types may not be clinically \nuseful. Thus, for developing automated methods for assessing cognitive functioning and \nmental health, it is critical to consider the underlying clinical constructs that are being \nevaluated. The adoption of evidence-  centered assessment design (ECD) ( Mislevy et al., \n2003 ) principles that consider evidentiary arguments to support validity claims (see Foltz \net al., 2023 ) is a compelling methodology. While widely used in educational assessment, \nECD has direct application to measurement of clinical states. This approach requires iden -\ntifying the clinical constructs that are being targeted, which could be some mixture of the \nphenomenological expressions of clinical states or the underlying neurocognitive processes. \nThen NLP features are linked in an evidence model to the targeted constructs, tying the \npsychological constructs to the computational methods within the context of assessment \ntasks. This provides a means of transparency and explainability of the contributions of the \nfeatures to model predictions and also provides a mechanism for actionable inferences. \n   \n  \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 12 ---\nComputational Language Analysis\n56727.4.2  Actionable Inferences\nML models are powerful tools that can uncover complex patterns and relationships in large \ndatasets, but these patterns must be explained in ways that they are useful to stakeholders. \nClinicians can use these models to gain a deeper understanding of human behavior, cogni -\ntion, and mental processes. By analyzing the output of ML models, clinicians should be able \nto identify important features, variables, or patterns that contribute to specific outcomes or \nbehaviors. This knowledge can inform the development of interventions, treatment plans, or \ntargeted interventions for individuals or groups (e.g., Holmlund, et al., 2019 ). Additionally, \nmental health researchers can use these models to generate hypotheses and guide further \nresearch, leading to new discoveries and advancements in the field. It is crucial, however, \nfor clinicians to be able to interpret and contextualize the output of ML models within the \nbroader theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence in psychology to ensure the validity \nand relevance of the derived inferences.\n27.4.3  Establishing Trustworthy Measures: Transparency, \nGeneralizability, and Explainability\nA lack of transparency and understanding surrounding AI and ML can undermine trust, \nwhich is crucial in the application of technology for psychological assessments. Clinicians \nneed ways of knowing how and why a recommendation was made by a model, other -\nwise the system won’t be used in practice. For a review of issues on ethical guidelines for \napplying AI in psychological assessment, see Diaz-  Asper et al. (2024) . Thus, to establish \ntrustworthiness, the field must address the three vital concepts of explainability, trans -\nparency, and generalizability (see Chandler et al., 2020a ). These elements are critical for \nensuring the viability of AI, where it can potentially assist in monitoring, evaluation, and \nprognosis of psychological constructs in the near future.\nExplainability can be accomplished in many ways, and tends to depend on the architec -\nture of the model used to produce predictions. Some examples include Local Interpretable \nModel-  agnostic Explanation (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) for neural \nnetworks or feature weight and decision path analyses for more traditional model types like \nlinear regression or decision trees. To establish transparency in an ML model, it is neces -\nsary to provide clear information about its purpose, architecture, training data statistics, \ntraining process, and underlying assumptions, including its appropriateness to types of \ntasks and populations. By applying an ECD framework approach to measurement, the \nsystem can demonstrate transparency of how the model’s features align with the constructs \nbeing assessed. Generalizability is critical to ensure that ML models are not overfitting idio -\nsyncrasies of a training set. The advantage of ML is its ability to leverage the variability \ninherent in large data to provide valid characterizations. Thus, large datasets are required. \nUnfortunately, many studies in psychological assessment have modest and insufficient \nsample sizes, which further exacerbates the issue, especially due to the lack of standard \ncross-  validation practices.\n27.4.4  Bias and Fairness\nThe biases and prejudices present in historical data have led to ML algorithms that per -\npetuate racial, economic, and gender discrimination ( Bolukbasi et al., 2016 ; Dastin, 2018 ;  \n \n  \n \n \n   \n\n--- Page 13 ---\nPeter W. Foltz and Chelsea Chandler\n568Henrich et al., 2010 ; O’Neil, 2016 ), as these algorithms learn from the samples of data \nupon which they are trained. This is a significant issue because it can amplify existing real-  \nworld issues and inequalities, particularly in measuring clinical states where healthcare \ndecisions may be impacted. Addressing bias in ML is crucial for ensuring fairness, equity, \nand ethical use of AI systems in decision-  making processes. To prevent issues related to \nbias and improve generalizability, it is crucial for the scientific community to develop large \nand trustworthy clinical datasets that accurately represent the target populations for the \ntesting of algorithms –   especially those that are widely used and have real consequences for \nmembers of marginalized communities. Such an approach should establish a standard for \nevery model to meet before it can be trusted for real-  world use.\n27.4.5  Human in the Loop ML Processing\nThus far, we have described the conventional ML approach used in psychological \nassessment research to understand how language features are combined to model psycho -\nlogical judgments. However, it has some pitfalls that can lead to incorrect assumptions. \nFor instance, there may be a lack of human understanding of the input data patterns \nwhich result in model uncertainty and how the models may handle such data. Research \nhas shown that outlier and anomaly detection approaches such as the Isolation Forest \nalgorithm ( Liu et al., 2018 ) could be used as a safeguard to mitigate instances of uncer -\ntainty ( Chandler et al., 2021 ). Also, data collection and labeling often prioritize fairly \nhomogeneous data over more diverse data needed to create a robust model ( Fisher et al., \n2018 ). Only rarely is an evaluation dataset put aside until a final model is trained, espe -\ncially when dealing with small datasets ( Foltz et al., 2016 ). Thus, the reported measures \nare biased as the models are created to maximize accuracy on those datasets (rather than \nthe preferred approach of being blind to the test data during model development). This \nframework may not be adequate for high stakes’ assessments that require robust and \nreliable models. Human-  in- the- loop techniques can improve the generalizability, trans -\nparency, reliability, and applicability of the traditional approaches and have been applied \nin educational and clinical assessment ( Baikadi et al., 2019 ; Chandler et al., 2022 ). \nInvolving humans in additional stages of model development enables the understanding \nof how psychological dimensions impact model predictions and supports dynamic, con -\ntinuous real-  world data comprising multiple channels. This approach generates models \nthat are as robust and reliable as the data allows and alerts to unusual inputs before \nspurious decisions are generated.\nA critical component of human-  in- the- loop processes is active learning during model \ntraining, where important data is selected for human labeling as early as possible. The pro -\ncess begins with the collection of both labeled and unlabeled data and a partially trained \nmodel that will improve with each iteration of active learning. Active learning ( Settles, \n2011 ) selects only the necessary data to make the model more certain in areas of uncer -\ntainty and fill general knowledge gaps, thus improving efficiency (i.e., requiring less labeled \ndata to achieve a given accuracy) and model robustness. To avoid biasing the model toward \nlearning overwhelmingly rare examples, these sampling techniques should be used in com -\nbination with random sampling. Once the selected data is labeled, the model is retrained, \nand the process is repeated until accuracy gains stabilize or a specific criterion is met. Similar \nstrategies used in active learning may more generally apply as human-  in- the- loop safeguards \nduring model deployment to investigate stability and robustness in new situations.   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n\n--- Page 14 ---\nComputational Language Analysis\n56927.5 Conclusions\nAutomated analysis of language has shown high accuracy for predicting cognitive and psy -\nchological states and has strong potential for needed clinical and assessment applications. \nApplying AI-  based methods can automate traditionally time-  intensive assessment tasks, \nallowing more frequent and timely assessment, diagnostic evaluation, feedback and \ninterventions. This can have positive impacts on increased accessibility to care, early detec -\ntion, personalized treatment plans, reduced stigma in having to go in for assessments. \nHowever, having an accurate ML model is only a small component that contributes within \nthe greater system of psychological assessment and support. Thus, the use of these technolo -\ngies needs to be considered within the larger context of (1) how to work with stakeholders \nto ensure the technology will appropriately be integrated into assessment and treatment \nworkflows, (2) the generalizability, transparency, and robustness of the systems, (3) the \nethical principles of collecting unobtrusive data and measuring and reporting psychological \nstate, and (4) how human and computer-  based psychological assessment and support work \ntogether to provide greatest benefit to end users.\nThis chapter has presented a generalized ML and natural language and speech pro -\ncessing approach to the extraction of inferences in the domain of cognitive functioning, \nspecifically as it pertains to the detection of cognitive states and diagnosis within clinical \npopulations. However, the approach is essentially the same as the approaches used for \nessay scoring, spoken language assessment, as well as for team communication assessment \n(e.g., Cooke et al., 2017 ; Foltz, 2018 ). Advances are being made in each of these areas, and \nit is valuable to draw inspiration from these domains to drive innovation. For example, \nthe health sector has focused very closely on understanding constructs and issues of bias \ndue to the extremely high stakes of misclassifications. Team assessment has focused on \nhow to assess higher level constructs like shared understanding, coordination, and situ -\nation awareness. Research in writing assessment and applying the ECD approaches from \neducational measurement has helped inform work being done in these other areas. All of \nthese fields operate under the assumption that language is a window into important aspects \nof cognitive, affective, and social functioning that are tied to skills, abilities, and/  or brain \nfunctions. By using this generalized approach, a set of construct relevant, reliable, and valid \nfeatures can be determined to create models which can continue to improve assessment and \nprovide practical tools to impact learning and the psychological well-  being of users.\nReferences\nAgurto C., Cecchi G., King S., Eyigoz E.

Kerr† \nThis essay is designed to help new law students prepare for the \nfirst few weeks of class. It explains what judicial opinions are, how they are structured, and what law students should look for when reading them. \nI. WHAT’S IN A LEGAL OPINION ? \nhen two people disagree and that disagreement leads to a lawsuit, the lawsuit will sometimes end with a ruling by a \njudge in favor of one side. The ju dge will explain the ruling in a \nwritten document referred to as an “opinion.” The opinion explains what the case is about, discusses the relevant legal principles, and then applies the law to the facts to reach a ruling in favor of one side \nand against the other. \nModern judicial opinions reflect hundreds of years of history and \npractice. They usually follow a simp le and predictable formula. This \n                                                                                                   \n \n† Orin Kerr is a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.

It starts  with the intro-\nductory materials at the top of an opinion and then moves on to the \nbody of the opinion. \nThe Caption \nThe first part of the case is the title of the case, known as the “cap-\ntion.” Examples include  Brown v. Board of Education  and Miranda v. \nArizona. The caption usually tells you the last names of the person \nwho brought the lawsuit and the person who is being sued. These \ntwo sides are often referred to as the “parties” or as the “litigants” in \nthe case. For example, if Ms. Smit h sues Mr. Jones, the case caption \nmay be Smith v. Jones  (or, depending on the court, Jones v. Smith ). \nIn criminal law, cases are brought by government prosecutors on \nbehalf of the government itself. This means that the government is \nthe named party. For example, if the federal government charges John Doe with a crime, the case caption will be United States v. Doe . \nIf a state brings the charges instead, the caption will be State v. Doe, \nPeople v. Doe , or Commonwealth v. Doe , depending on the practices of \nthat state.\n1 \nThe Case Citation  \nBelow the case name you will find some letters and numbers. These \nletters and numbers are the legal citation for the case. A citation tells you the name of the court th at decided the case, the law book \nin which the opinion was published,  and the year in which the court \ndecided the case. For example, “U.S. Supreme Court, 485 U.S. 759 \n(1988)” refers to a U.S. Supreme Court case decided in 1988 that \nappears in Volume 485 of the United States Reports starting at page \n759. \nThe Author of  the Opinion \nThe next information is the name of the judge who wrote the opin-ion. Most opinions assigned in law school were issued by courts \n                                                                                                   \n \n1 English criminal cases normally will be Rex v. Doe  or Regina v. Doe. Rex and \nRegina aren’t the victims: the words are Latin for “King” and “Queen.” During \nthe reign of a King, English courts use “R ex”; during the reign of a Queen, they \nswitch to “Regina.” \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nHow to Read a Legal Opinion \nAUTUMN 2007  53 with multiple judges. The name tells you which judge wrote that \nparticular opinion. In older cases, the opinion often simply states a last name followed by the initial “J.” No, judges don’t all have the \nfirst initial “J.” The letter stands fo r “Judge” or “Justice,” depending \non the court. On occasion, the opinion will use the Latin phrase “per curiam” instead of a judge’s name. Per curiam means “by the \ncourt.” It signals that the opinion reflects a common view among all the judges rather than the wr itings of a specific judge. \nThe Facts of the Case \nNow let’s move on to the opinion it self. The first part of the body \nof the opinion presents the facts of  the case. In other words, what \nhappened? The facts might be that Andy pulled out a gun and shot \nBob. Or maybe Fred agreed to give Sally $100 and then changed his mind. Surprisingly, there are no pa rticular rules for what facts a \njudge must include in the fact se ction of an opinion. Sometimes the \nfact sections are long, and somet imes they are short. Sometimes \nthey are clear and accurate, and other times they are vague or in-complete. \nMost discussions of the facts als o cover the “procedural history” \nof the case. The procedural histor y explains how the legal dispute \nworked its way through the legal syst em to the court that is issuing \nthe opinion. It will include various motions, hearings, and trials that occurred after the case was initially filed. Your civil procedure class is all about that kind of stuff; you should pay ve ry close attention to \nthe procedural history of cases when you read assignments for your civil procedure class. The procedur al history of cases usually will be \nless important when you read a case for your other classes. \nThe Law of the Case \nAfter the opinion presents the fact s, it will then discuss the law. \nMany opinions present the law in two stages. The first stage dis-\ncusses the general principles of law that are relevant to cases such as \nthe one the court is deciding. This section might explore the history of a particular field of law or may include a discussion of past cases \n(known as “precedents”) that are related to the case the court is de-\n\n--- Page 6 ---\nOrin S. Kerr \n54  11 GREEN BAG 2D ciding. This part of the opinion gives the reader background to help \nunderstand the context and significan ce of the court’s decision. The \nsecond stage of the legal section a pplies the general legal principles \nto the particular facts of the dispute.  As you might guess, this part is \nin many ways the heart of the opini on: It gets to the bottom line of \nwhy the court is ruling for one side and against the other. \nConcurring  and/or Dissenting  Opinions  \nMost of the opinions you read as a law student are “majority” opin-ions. When a group of judges get together to decide a case, they vote on which side should win and also try to agree on a legal ra-\ntionale to explain why that side has won. A majority opinion is an \nopinion joined by the majority of judges on that court. Although most decisions are unanimous, so me cases are not. Some judges \nmay disagree and will write a separate opinion offering a different approach. Those opinions are calle d “concurring opi nions” or “dis-\nsenting opinions,” and they appear after the majority opinion. A \n“concurring opinion” (sometimes just called a “concurrence”) ex-\nplains a vote in favor of the winning side but based on a different legal rationale. A “dissenting opini on” (sometimes just  called a “dis-\nsent”) explains a vote in favor of the losing side. \nII. COMMON LEGAL TERMS \nFOUND IN OPINIONS \now that you know what’s in a le gal opinion, it’s time to learn \nsome of the common words you’ll find inside them. But first a \nhistory lesson, for reasons that should be clear in a minute. \nIn 1066, William the Conqueror came across the English Chan-\nnel from what is now France and conquered the land that is today \ncalled England. The conquering Normans spoke French and the de-feated Saxons spoke Old English. The Normans took over the court \nsystem, and their language became the language of the law. For sev-\neral centuries after the French-speaking Normans took over Eng-land, lawyers and judges in Englis h courts spoke in French. When \nEnglish courts eventually returned to using English, they continued to use many French words. N \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nHow to Read a Legal Opinion \nAUTUMN 2007  55 Why should you care about this ancient history? The American \ncolonists considered themselves En glishmen, so they used the Eng-\nlish legal system and adopted its language. This means that Ameri-\ncan legal opinions today are littere d with weird French terms. Ex-\namples include plaintiff, defendan t, tort, contract, crime, judge, \nattorney, counsel, court, verdict, pa rty, appeal, evidence, and jury. \nThese words are the everyday lan guage of the American legal sys-\ntem. And they’re all from the Fren ch, brought to you by William \nthe Conqueror in 1066. \nThis means that when you read  a legal opinion, you’ll come \nacross a lot of foreign-sounding wor ds to describe the court system. \nYou need to learn all of these words eventually; you should read \ncases with a legal dictionary near by and should look up every word \nyou don’t know. But this section will give you a head start by intro-\nducing you to some of the most common words, many of which (but not all) are French in origin. \nTypes of Disputes and the  Names of Participants  \nThere are two basic kinds of legal disputes: civil and criminal. In a \ncivil case, one person files a lawsuit against another asking the court to order the other side to pay him money or to do or stop doing something. An award of money is called “damages” and an order to \ndo something or to refrain from doing something is called an “in-\njunction.” The person bringing the lawsuit is known as the “plaintiff” \nand the person sued is called the “defendant.” \nIn criminal cases, there is no plaintiff and no lawsuit. The role of \na plaintiff is occupied by a govern ment prosecutor. Instead of filing \na lawsuit (or equivalently, “suing” someone), the prosecutor files \ncriminal “charges.” Instead of asking for damages or an injunction, the prosecutor asks the court to punish the individual through either jail time or a fine. The government prosecutor is often referred to as “the state,” “the prosecution,” or simply “the government.” The \nperson charged is called the defenda nt, just like the person sued in a \ncivil case. \nIn legal disputes, each party ordinarily is represented by a law-\nyer. Legal opinions use several di fferent words for lawyers, includ-\n\n--- Page 8 ---\nOrin S. Kerr \n56  11 GREEN BAG 2D ing “attorney” and “counsel.” There are some historical differences \namong these terms, but for the last century or so they have all meant the same thing. When a lawyer addresses a judge in court, she will always address the judge as “your honor,” just like lawyers \ndo in the movies. In legal opinions, however, judges will usually \nrefer to themselves as “the Court.” \nTerms in Appellate  Litigation  \nMost opinions that you read in law school are appellate opinions, \nwhich means that they decide the out come of appeals. An “appeal” is \na legal proceeding that considers whether another court’s legal deci-sion was right or wrong. After a court has ruled for one side, the \nlosing side may seek review of that  decision by filing an appeal be-\nfore a higher court. The original court is usually known as the trial court, because that’s where the tr ial occurs if there is one. The \nhigher court is known as the appellat e or appeals court, as it is the \ncourt that hears the appeal. \nA single judge presides over tr ial court proceedings, but appel-\nlate cases are decided by panels of  several judges. For example, in \nthe federal court system, run by the United States government, a \nsingle trial judge known as a District Court judge oversees the trial stage. Cases can be appealed to the next higher court, the Court of Appeals, where cases are decided by panels of three judges known as Circuit Court judges. A side th at loses before the Circuit Court \ncan seek review of that decision at the United States Supreme Court. Supreme Court cases are decided by all nine judges. Su-preme Court judges are called Justices instead of judges; there is one “Chief Justice” and the other eight are just plain “Justices” (technically they are “Associate Justices,” but everyone just calls \nthem “Justices”). \nDuring the proceedings before th e higher court, the party that \nlost at the original court and is therefore filing the appeal is usually \nknown as the “appellant.” The party that won in the lower court and must defend the lower court’s de cision is known as the “appellee”  \n(accent on the last syllable). Some older opinions may refer to the \nappellant as the “plaintiff in error”  and the appellee as the “defendant \n\n--- Page 9 ---\nHow to Read a Legal Opinion \nAUTUMN 2007  57 in error.” Finally, some courts label  an appeal as a “petition,” and \nrequire the losing party to petition the higher court for relief. In \nthese cases, the party that lost be fore the lower court and is filing \nthe petition for review is called the “petitioner.” The party that won \nbefore the lower court and is responding to the petition in the \nhigher court is called the “respondent.” \nConfused yet? You probably are, but don’t worry. You’ll read so \nmany cases in the next few weeks th at you’ll get used to all of this \nvery soon. \nIII. WHAT YOU NEED TO LEARN FROM \nREADING A CASE \nkay, so you’ve just read a case  for class. You think you under-\nstand it, but you’re not sure if  you learned what your profes-\nsor wanted you to learn. Here is what professors want students to know after reading a case assigned for class: \nKnow the Facts \nLaw professors love the facts. When they call on students in class, they typically begin by asking student s to state the facts of a particu-\nlar case. Facts are important because law is often highly fact-sensitive, which is a fancy way of saying that the proper legal out-\ncome depends on the exact detail s of what happened. If you don’t \nknow the facts, you can’t really understand the case and can’t un-derstand the law. \nMost law students don’t apprecia te the importance of the facts \nwhen they read a case. Students th ink, “I’m in law school, not fact \nschool; I want to know what the law is, not just what happened in this one case.” But trust me: the facts are really important.\n2 \n                                                                                                    \n2 If you don’t believe me, you should take a look at a few law school exams. It \nturns out that the most common form of law school exam question presents a \nlong description of a very particular set of facts. It then asks the student to “spot” \nand analyze the legal issues presented by  those facts. These exam questions are \nknown as “issue-spotters,” as they test th e student’s ability to understand the facts \nand spot the legal issues they raise. As you might imagine, doing well on an issue-O \n\n--- Page 10 ---\n58  11 GREEN BAG 2D Orin S. Kerr \nKnow the Specific  Legal Arguments  Made by the Parties \nLawsuits are disputes, and judges  only issue opinions when two par-\nties to a dispute disagree on a particular legal question. This means \nthat legal opini ons focus on resolv ing the parties’ ver y specific dis-\nagreement. The lawyers, not the judges, take the lead role in fram-\ning the issues raised by a case. \nIn an appeal, for example, the lawyer \nfor the appellant will ar-\nticulate specific ways in which the lower court was wrong. The ap-\npellate court will then look at those arguments and either agree or \ndisagree. (Now you can understa nd why people pay big buc\nks for \ntop lawyers; the best lawyers are highly skilled at identifying and \narticulating their arguments to the court.) Because the lawyers take \nthe lead role in fram ing the issues, you need  to understand exactly \nwhat arguments the two sides were making. \nKnow the Disposition  \nThe “disposition” of a case is the ac tion the court to ok. It is often \nannounced at the very end of the opinion. For example, an appeals \ncourt might “affirm” a lower court de\ncision, upholding it, or it \nmight “reverse” the decisi\non, ruli ng for the other side. Alterna-\ntively, an appeals court might “v acate” t he lower court decision, \nwiping the lower-court decision off the books, and then “remand” \nthe case, sending it back to the lower court for further proceedings. \nFor now, you should keep in mind that when a higher court “af-\nfirms” it means that the lower court had it right (in result, if not in \nreasoning). Words like “reverse,” “remand,” and “vacate” mean \nthat the higher court thought the lower court had it wrong. \nUnderstand  the Reasoning  of the Majority  Opinion \nTo understand the reasoning of an op ini on, you should first identify \nthe source of the law the judge appl ied. Some opinions interpret the \nConstitution, the founding charter of the government. Other cases \nspotter requires developing a carefu l and nuanced understanding of the impor-\ntance of the facts. The best way to prepare for that is to read the fact sections of \nyour cases very carefully.  \n\n--- Page 11 ---\nHow to Read a Legal Opinion \nAUTUMN 2007  59 interpret “statutes,” which is a fancy name for written laws passed \nby legislative bodies such as Congress. Still other cases interpret “the common law,” which is a term that usually refers to the body of prior case decisions that derive ultimately from pre-1776 English \nlaw that the Colonists br ought over from England.\n3 \nIn your first year, the opinions that you read in your Torts, Con-\ntracts, and Property classes will mostly interpret the common law. Opinions in Criminal Law mostly interpret either the common law \nor statutes. Finally, opinions in your Civil Procedure casebook will \nmostly interpret statutory law or  the Constitution. The source of \nlaw is very important because American law follows a clear hierar-\nchy. Constitutional rules trump statutory (statute-based) rules, and statutory rules trump common law rules. \nAfter you have identified the source of law, you should next \nidentify the method of reasoning that the court used to justify its decision. When a case is governed  by a statute, for example, the \ncourt usually will simply follow wh at the statute says. The court’s \nrole is narrow in such settings beca use the legislature has settled the \nlaw. Similarly, when past courts have already answered similar \nquestions before, a court may conclude that it is required to reach a \nparticular result because it is boun d by the past precedents. This is \nan application of the judicial practice of “stare decisis,” an abbrevia-tion of a Latin phrase meaning “That which has been already decided should remain settled.” \nIn other settings, courts may just ify their decisions on public pol-\nicy grounds. That is, they may pick th e rule that they think is the \nbest rule, and they may explain in the opinion why they think that rule is best. This is particularly likely in common law cases where judges are not bound by a statute or constitutional rule. Other \ncourts will rely on morality, fairness, or notions of justice to justify \n                                                                                                   \n \n3 The phrase “common law” started being used about a thousand years ago to refer \nto laws that were common to all Englis h citizens. Thus, the word “common” in \nthe phrase “common law” means common in the sense of “shared by all,” not \ncommon in the sense of “not very special.” The “common law” was announced in judicial opinions. As a result, you will so metimes hear the phrase “common law” \nused to refer to areas of judge-made la w as opposed to legislatively-made law. \n\n--- Page 12 ---\nOrin S. Kerr \n60  11 GREEN BAG 2D their decisions. Many courts will mix and match, relying on several \nor even all of these justifications. \nUnderstand  the Significance  of the Majority  Opinion \nSome opinions resolve the parties’  legal dispute by announcing and \napplying a clear rule of law that is new to that particular case. That rule is known as the “holding” of  the case. Holdings are often con-\ntrasted with “dicta” found in an opi nion. Dicta refers to legal state-\nments in the opinion not needed to resolve the dispute of the par-ties; the word is a pluralized abbr eviation of the Latin phrase “obiter \ndictum,” which means “a remark by the way.” \nWhen a court announces a clear holding, you should take a min-\nute to think about how the court’s rule would apply in other situa-tions. During class, professors like  to pose “hypotheticals,” new sets \nof facts that are different from those found in the cases you have \nread. They do this for two reasons. Fi rst, it’s hard to understand the \nsignificance of a legal rule unless you think about how it might apply \nto lots of different situations. A rule might look good in one setting, \nbut another set of facts might reveal a major problem or ambiguity. Second, judges often reason by “analogy,” which means a new case may be governed by an older case when the facts of the new case are \nsimilar to those of the older one. This raises the question, which are \nthe legally relevant facts for this particular rule? The best way to \nevaluate this is to consider new se ts of facts. You’ll spend a lot of \ntime doing this in class, and you can get a head start on your class \ndiscussions by asking the hypotheticals on your own before class \nbegins. \nFinally, you should accept that some opinions are vague. Some-\ntimes a court won’t explain its reas oning very well, and that forces \nus to try to figure out what the opinion means. You’ll look for the \nholding of the case but become frustrated because you can’t find one. It’s not your fault; some opinions are written in a narrow way \nso that there is no clear holding, and others are just poorly reasoned \nor written. Rather than trying to fill in the ambiguity with false cer-\ntainty, try embracing the ambiguity in stead. One of the skills of top-\nflight lawyers is that they know  what they don’t know: they know \n\n--- Page 13 ---\nHow to Read a Legal Opinion \nAUTUMN 2007  61 when the law is unclear. Indeed, this skill of identifying when a \nproblem is easy and when it is hard (in the sense of being unsettled \nor unresolved by the courts) is one of the keys to doing very well in law school. The best law students are the ones who recognize and \nidentify these unsettled issues without  pretending that they are easy. \nUnderstand  Any Concurring  and/or  Dissenting  Opinions  \nYou probably won’t believe me at  first, but concurrences and dis-\nsents are very important. You need to read them carefully. To un-derstand why, you need to appreciate that law is man-made, and Anglo-American law has often been judge-made. Learning to “think like a lawyer” often means learning to think like a judge, which \nmeans learning how to evaluate wh ich rules and explanations are \nstrong and which are weak. Courts occasionally say things that are \nsilly, wrongheaded, or confused, and you need to think independ-ently about what judges say. \nConcurring and dissenting opinion s often do this work for you. \nCasebook authors edit out any unimportant concurrences and dis-sents to keep the opinions short. When concurrences and dissents \nappear in a casebook, it signals that  they offer some valuable insights \nand raise important arguments. Disagreement between the majority \nopinion and concurring or dissenting opinions often frames the key \nissue raised by the case; to understand the case, you need to under-\nstand the arguments offered in concurring and dissenting opinions. \nIV. WHY DO LAW PROFESSORS  \nUSE THE CASE METHOD ? \n’ll conclude by stepping back and explaining why law professors \nbother with the case method. Every law student quickly realizes \nthat law school classes are very di fferent from college classes. Your \ncollege professors probably stood at the podium and droned on while you sat back in your chair,  safe in your cocoon. You’re now \nstarting law school, and it’s very different. You’re reading about actual cases, real-life disputes, and you’re trying to learn about the law by picking up bits and pieces of it from what the opinions tell I \n\n--- Page 14 ---\nOrin S. Kerr \n62  11 GREEN BAG 2D you. Even weirder, your professo rs are asking you questions about \nthose opinions, getting everyone to join in a discussion about them. \nWhy the difference?, you may be wondering. Why do law schools use the case method at all? \nI think there are two major reaso ns, one historical and the other \npractical. \nThe Historical Reason  \nThe legal system that we have i nherited from England is largely \njudge-focused. The judges have ma de the law what it is through \ntheir written opinions. To understand that law, we need to study the actual decisions that the judges  have written. Further, we need \nto learn to look at law the way that judges look at law. In our sys-tem of government, judges can on ly announce the law when decid-\ning real disputes: they can’t just have a press conference and an-\nnounce a set of legal rules. (This is sometimes referred to as the \n“case or controversy” requirement; a court has no power to decide \nan issue unless it is presented by  an actual case or controversy be-\nfore the court.) To look at the law the way that judges do, we need \nto study actual cases and controversie s, just like the judges. In short, \nwe study real cases and disputes because real cases and disputes his-torically have been the primary source of law. \nThe Practical  Reason \nA second reason professors use the ca se method is that it teaches an \nessential skill for practicing lawyers . Lawyers represent clients, and \nclients will want to know how laws apply to them. To advise a cli-ent, a lawyer needs to understand exactly how an abstract rule of law will apply to the very specific situations a client might encoun-\nter. This is more difficult than y ou might think, in part because a \nlegal rule that sounds definite and clear in the abstract may prove \nmurky in application. (For example,  imagine you go to a public park \nand see a sign that says “No vehicles in the park.” That plainly for-bids an automobile, but what ab out bicycles, wheelchairs, toy \nautomobiles? What about airplanes ? Ambulances? Are these “vehi-\ncles” for the purpose of the rule or not?) As a result, good lawyers \n\n--- Page 15 ---\nHow to Read a Legal Opinion \nAUTUMN 2007  63 need a vivid imagination; they n eed to imagine how rules might ap-\nply, where they might be unclear, and where they might lead to \nunexpected outcomes. The case me thod and the frequent use of \nhypotheticals will help train your brain to think this way. Learning \nthe law in light of concrete situ ations will help you deal with par-\nticular facts you’ll encounter as a practicing lawyer. \nGood luck! \n \n \n\n--- Page 16 ---\nCopyright © 2007 The Green Bag, Inc. “The Green Bag” and the       logo are our registered trademarks.",

As a \ncenterpiece for the chapter, a “how-  to roadmap,” represented graphically, provides a walk-  \nthrough of the major steps involved in constructing and documenting a validity argument. \nIn discussing each of these steps, the following issues are addressed:\n •The relevant sections of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing  (referred \nto as Standards ) (AERA et al., 2014 ) and other governing principles and guidelines rele -\nvant to validity arguments.\n •Current principles and practices in artificial intelligence (AI)—  the current predominant \nform of automated scoring—  as they relate to validity arguments. These include how AI \nscoring engines are optimized for specific scoring tasks, the meaning of “fairness” and its \nplace in validity arguments, and important changes in the AI landscape such as explain -\nable and responsible (or principled) AI.\n •The call for more principled approaches to constructing validity technical reports.\nThe chapter concludes with a discussion of ongoing challenges and areas for future \nresearch. Specifically, the role of audits and external evaluations, the pace of change and \nincreased complexity in AI, challenges around fairness and diversity, and future research \nsuggestions are addressed.\n23.2 The Roadmap\nIt is well known throughout the literature on assessment design and validation that validity \narguments come down to providing evidence to support specific claims about what an  \nassessment should do and how well it is doing those things. Yet, despite decades of calls for  \nmore principled approaches to validity arguments, including more careful reasoning around  \nspecific evidence and claims, many validity argument technical reports (VATRs) read more   \n   \n \n   \n\n--- Page 2 ---\nDavid Dorsey, Hillary Michaels, and Steve Ferrara\n470like “data dumps” ( Ferrara et al., 2023 ). The hope for this chapter is to provide a concise  \nguide or roadmap for producing quality VATRs—  ones that clearly and concisely provide  \nevidence from test design, test development, and psychometric outcomes to make validity  \narguments that support intended score interpretations and uses. This is more important  \nthan ever, as various forms of AI have been introduced, providing a wide variety of new  \ncomplexities and challenges (e.g., see the special issue edited by Dorsey & Michaels, 2022 ).\n23.2.1  Describe Assessment Constructs, Including Rationale  \nfor Using Automated Scoring\nQuality VATRs should begin with the foundation of all modern measurement: telling \nthe reader what one is presuming to measure, that is, describing or defining assessment \nconstructs. Several researchers have provided guidance on different ways of defining \nconstructs (e.g., Ferrara et al., 2016 ). These include approaches such as construct maps \n(Wilson, 2005 ), cognitive models ( Leighton & Gierl, 2007 ), or various types of construct \nmodels as presented in evidence-  centered design ( Ercikan & McCaffrey, 2022 ). The readers \nFigure 23.1   Validity Argument Roadmap for Automated Scoring. \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n\n--- Page 3 ---\nValidity Argument Roadmap for Automated Scoring\n471are referred to the work by Ercikan and McCaffrey (2022) , who deal with the complex -\nities of construct definition in AI-  enabled assessment settings. These authors highlight the \nimportance of describing the details around parts of construct definitions against specific \nautomated scoring algorithms. They provide an example writing construct that includes \nconveying complex ideas. Such a construct element requires a scoring algorithm capable \nof measuring human-  related complexity. Without specifying clear evidentiary chains, we \nare left with somewhat vapid construct definitions and scoring algorithms that appear to \nmatch human scores at a broad level yet have little to do with specific aspects (or features) \nof construct definitions. A wealth of current research discusses the limitations of only infer -\nring construct relevance via the correlation of human and machine/  automated scores (e.g., \nWood, 2020 ). In our view, it is generally accepted at this point that automated scoring \nengines typically evaluate only a small fraction of elements within construct definitions \n(e.g., writing) and that high correlations can be achieved even when humans and machines \nfocus on different features ( Wood, 2020 ). Wood (2020)  discusses several useful ways to deal \nwith such issues from a policy and public communication perspective.\nNote that in practical terms, many, if not most, construct definitions relevant to a VATR \noccur within the context of test blueprints or test specifications—  often driven by subject \nmatter expert (SME) judgments and/  or sets of external standards. Here again, a cautious \nreader should not rely upon overly broad construct claims, particularly in automated \nscoring settings. As pointed out by Ferrara and Qunbar (2022) , the Standards  clearly call \nfor specifications of construct relevance and construct representation. As more complex \nAI- based scoring approaches are developed, some aspects of construct definition may neces -\nsarily be less transparent and explainable. Thus, these authors suggest a focus on feasible \ntransparency and explainability , particularly as it relates to what assessments are actually \nmeasuring, that is, construct definition. This is one of many areas in which measurement \nprofessionals are not alone in wrestling with AI, as entire fields of endeavor exist within \nmodern computer science and data science around “how explainability contributes to trust \nin AI” ( Ferrario & Loi, 2022 ).\nCallout Box: Example of a Construct Definition Statement\nThe current assessment measures the constructs of student writing in terms of content, cre -\nativity, style, mechanics, and organization , as specified and described in the relevant Standards \nfor Writing. *\n* For elaboration of this type of example, see Shermis (2022) . In this case, the researcher would \nspecify and describe in more detail the relevant Standards.\n23.2.2  Document Intended Score Interpretation and Uses (SIUs) \n(Including Scoring Rubrics, Processes, and Features)\nClosely related to describing assessment constructs is the practice of documenting intended \nSIUs (including scoring rubrics, rules, processes, and features). To effectively achieve this \ngoal, it is helpful to be clear about how information is provided. If stakeholders of various \ntypes do not clearly understand why a given set of assessments and scoring methods is  \n  \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 4 ---\nDavid Dorsey, Hillary Michaels, and Steve Ferrara\n472used, a key link in an ultimate validity chain/  argument is lost. SIU is the dominant con -\ncept in defining validity and validation processes and criteria in the Standards  (Ferrara & \nQunbar, 2022 ; Ferrara et al., 2023 ). The Standards  specifically call for supporting theory \nand evidence concerning: (1) how test scores are interpreted against presumed end uses and \n(2) how interpretations align with the constructs the tests are intended to measure.\nCallout Box: Example of an SIU Statement\nThe current assessment uses a set of Prose Constructed Response prompts that elicit specific \nknowledge and skills identified in the construct definitions above. The prompts elicit written \nresponses that are scored via automated scoring (details on these scoring methods are provided \nelsewhere in this report), allowing valid inferences about student knowledge and skills in line \nwith the relevant Standards for Writing.\nClear and accurate SIU statements also help define which examinee responses will be \nautomatically scored. They permit the identification of assessment activities that are both \nscorable by AI algorithms and related to the targeted construct(s). Ferrara, Roussos, and \nQin (2023)  provide a useful framework for evaluating the quality of SIU statements for \neach claim and sub-  claim regarding Relevance, Completeness, and Overall Support.\nToo often in modern practice, the idea of applying automated scoring occurs after \nassessment design decisions have already been made. As Ercikan and McCaffrey (2022)  \npoint out, this post hoc design often limits automated scoring to function merely as a human \nscorer replacement. Such an approach fails to consider that many AI algorithms and models \nare better than humans at some scoring tasks. Perhaps the best way to think about this comes \nin the form proposed by Ferrara and Qunbar (2022)  that future automated scoring engines \nshould be thought of as “Optimized Decision Algorithms” rather than “Replicators of \nHuman Decision-  Making Processes” (p. 296). For example, recent AI benchmark research \nsuggests that for tasks such as handwriting recognition, speech recognition, image labeling, \nreading comprehension, and some aspects of language understanding, AI models achieve \nbetter results than humans on the same tasks ( Kiela et al., 2021 ). However, as the authors of \nsuch research point out, this does not necessarily mean that these models have the human-  \nlevel natural language capabilities that such results might suggest. Hence, again we find \nthe need for carefully constructed and supported SIUs and construct relevance arguments. \nThese issues will become paramount with the recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs; \ne.g., ChatGPT), with debates now occurring within both academic and commercial settings \nabout whether we could experience Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in the current era \n(Bubeck et al., 2023 ). In summary, to match the call for using principled validity arguments \n(e.g., National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NAS], 2020 ), a prin -\ncipled approach to AI use, i.e., Principled AI ( Field et al., 2020 ), is paramount.\n23.2.3  Describe Test Blueprints and Specifications to  \nClarify Item Types That Use Automated Scoring\nOnce assessment activities that can be scored automatically have been identified and are \nrelated to the constructs through the corresponding SIU statements, the next step is to  \n  \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 5 ---\nValidity Argument Roadmap for Automated Scoring\n473document the test blueprint and specifications following traditional practices. This involves \nidentifying the content standards and/  or knowledge, skills, abilities, or other characteristics \n(KSAOs) identified in a domain/  job/ practice analysis that must be included in the assessment \nblueprint. Moreover, a blueprint typically documents how these targets are assessed via items \nand other assessment activities that may be machine scored, scored by humans, or combined.\nIn practice, test blueprints are often presented in the form of tables that provide a brief \ndescription of the assessment task/  item type, the primary standards (or KSAOs identified \nin domain analysis) that the task type is designed to assess, information regarding whether \nthe task type is a discrete or set-  based item, the number of raw score points assigned to \neach item, and the number of items that appear on a test form at each level (e.g., grade \nlevel and job level). Assessment designers also sometimes specify elements such as Depth of \nKnowledge estimates, computer adaptive versus fixed form, or other item characteristics as \npart of blueprint descriptions. Assessment designers should also include special consider -\nations regarding whether and how the task/  item type is enhanced with technology and/  or \nautomated scoring in test blueprints. The key takeaway for VATR development is to cap -\nture any details of blueprint design that lead to key claims or sources of validity evidence.\nCallout Box: Example of a Test Blueprint Statement  \nClaim/   Reporting Category Number of \nItemsPossible \nPointsLink to Content \nStandardsAutomated \nScoring\n1.

Typically, \nelaborate processes are used for developing initial items, having multiple rounds of human \nreview (including sensitivity review for screening of content that would be inappropriate, \npotentially biasing, or offensive to different subgroups), and item piloting or field testing. \nFor VATR development, key aspects of item development to capture would be any elem -\nents that support (or do not support) validity claims. These might include the specific item \ndevelopment processes and methods, the expertise and background of item writers and/  or \neditors, and versioning control and item banking methods and features.\nIn the future, we expect that there will be an increased focus on the use of automated \nitem generation (AIG). AIG refers to using statistical or machine-  driven models to produce \ntest items or assist in their production ( Gierl & Haladyna, 2013 ). AIG has been around \nfor decades, with earlier versions following a type of item-  templating approach ( Bejar,  \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 6 ---\nDavid Dorsey, Hillary Michaels, and Steve Ferrara\n4742002 ). More modern methods are based on AI/  machine learning (ML) models involving \ntechnologies such as deep learning neural networks ( von Davier, 2018 ). Research on AIG \ndemonstrates promise regarding significant time and cost savings and may even be applic -\nable in high-  stake assessment settings (e.g., Leslie & Gierl, 2023 ). Moreover, with the wide -\nspread availability of LLMs and related generative AI techniques, AIG as a field of endeavor \nis exploding ( Lee et al., 2023 ). If using AIG for operational assessment, assessment designers \nmust document the following in a VATR:\n •Link AIG processes to the design principles, guidelines, and information on constructs \nand SIUs highlighted above.\n •Describe steps to ensure that construct irrelevant variance and biases are not introduced \ninto item development via algorithm/  model use.\n •Describe item evaluation methods that might be part of the AIG process (e.g., automated \npsychometric analyses that prune items during generation).\n •Document why AIG is appropriate or required in the first place.\n23.2.5  Document Approach for Developing AI Scoring Model(s)\nThe approach used to document how an automated/  AI scoring model is developed in \nsupport of validity claims highly depends on the type of AI model used. For assessments \nrelated to essay and constructed response type scoring, most models developed in the recent \npast follow steps such as those described below. The literature contains entire volumes that \nexpand on these steps and address many other aspects of scoring model development (see \nDavis & Papageorgiou, 2021 ; Yan et al., 2020 ).\n •Developers gather initial responses produced by actual test takers along with human-  \nderived scores.\n •The human-  scored essays are imported into the automated scoring model. Often some \ndegree of data cleaning, processing, and standardization is used to prepare the materials \nfor machine readability.\n •Next, developers identify a set of key “features” from the training data. A feature can \nbe any characteristic of a response that is relevant to scoring (e.g., number of words, \nreading level, or the presence of certain words or phrases).\n •Developers then fit a statistical or increasingly ML model to convert the features into a \npredicted score.\n •The result is a set of features that are important for establishing a score and what weights \nor rules are needed to convert feature values into predicted scores.\nTo produce initial validity evidence, developers typically pursue the following additional steps:\n •Developers confirm that the trained model can score new responses—  responses \nthe engine has not seen before. This is done during a model validation process (i.e., \ncross-  validation).\n •Model validation typically involves importing and scoring new responses produced by \nactual test takers. The same steps described above apply.  \n \n \n   \n\n--- Page 7 ---\nValidity Argument Roadmap for Automated Scoring\n475 •Automated scores are then computed for the new responses and compared to human \nratings/  evaluations. Researchers use a variety of metrics to compare the automated \nscores with human scores, such as score point distributions, exact agreement, and quad -\nratic weighted kappa.\nNote that with the rise of relatively affordable computing and advanced AI/  ML \nalgorithms, the number of features we can capture and include in scoring models has grown \nexponentially (see Lottridge et al., 2023  for a discussion).\nCallout Box: Example Description of Scoring Features*  \nConstruct Possible Scoring Features\nRelevance: Is the content of the \nresponse relevant to the  \nprompt?• Cosine similarity between the response \nand expert responses\n• Probability of the text response based on a \ntrained language model\nAccuracy: Is the answer free of \ngrammatical errors?• Number of spelling errors\n• Number of grammatical errors\nCreativity: Is the use of words  \nand sentence structure creative and \nvaried?• Creativity score from a trained large \nlanguage model ( Li et al., 2023 )\nOrganization: Is the organization \nlogical and coherent?• Coherence measures among sentences\n• Key sentence detection (e.g., intro, \nconclusion)\nNote: * Adapted from LaFlair, Yancey, Settles, and von Davier (2023) .\nWhen implementing automated scoring engines, test providers often use complex sets \nof “validity papers” and routing mechanisms to score responses ( Shin et al., 2019 ). For \nexample, a vendor might create an integrated system between human scoring and automated \nscoring, where both an automated score and/  or a human score can be assigned based on \na predetermined operational flow. With such systems, the client typically approves spe -\ncific quality criteria for evaluating automated scoring. Developers use a set of responses to \nvalidity papers with “known” scores assigned by experts to monitor human scoring over \ntime. The general expectation is that automated systems will score validity papers at least \nas accurately as humans.\nFor VATR development, developers must describe the key elements of model develop -\nment, such as those highlighted above, in terms of their linkages to validity evidence and \nclaims included in the VATR. There are numerous details about model development that \ndevelopers could deem relevant for inclusion in a VATR, ranging from choices of mod -\neling techniques, specific data collection processes, arguments for training data representa -\ntiveness, key software dependencies, scoring outcomes in terms of fairness and subgroup \ndifferences, fairness mitigations used, sensitivity analysis or model “stress testing,” and \nlongitudinal drift analysis to ensure that the scoring model does not become less accurate or  \n  \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 8 ---\nDavid Dorsey, Hillary Michaels, and Steve Ferrara\n476relevant over time and/  or over changes happening in the construct domain. Also included \nin these considerations is the possibility that a model can be “gamed” or, in the language of \nthe ML literature, “poisoned” ( Bejar, 2017 ; Oprea et al., 2022 ). Such gaming could result \nin construct-  irrelevant response strategies and must be considered as part of the scoring \nmodel development and validity documentation. Lane (2023)  discusses these and many \nother aspects of model development and how they relate to validity arguments.\nNote that with the rise of new AI models (e.g., LLMs), model development and docu -\nmentation requirements are changing quickly. Researchers have begun investigating LLMs \nas a new form of automated scoring (e.g., Mizumoto & Eguchi, 2023 ), and future research \nwill need to clarify the related validity requirements for such use cases.\n23.2.6  Describe Test Administration Procedures, Including Evidence \nSupporting Validity Arguments and System Security\nAssessment developers may not typically think of test administration procedures as imme -\ndiately relevant to validity arguments. However, there are numerous cases where real-  life \nadministration issues might overturn the most well-  designed validity arguments. Consider \nthe real-  world case of technological disruptions. In 2018, the Tennessee Department of \nEducation (TDOE) experienced widespread technology disruptions with students com -\npleting computer-  based TNReady exams (a high-  stake state-  wide assessment). Designed to \nassess student knowledge and understanding across various domains, TNReady plays a vital \nrole within the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program by providing information on \nwhat students know and can do. Understandably, TDOE was concerned that the disruptions \ncould have negatively affected student test scores. To address this concern, TDOE sponsored \na study using multiple advanced psychometric and statistical methods to conduct a rigorous \ncomparison of student test scores between disrupted and non-  disrupted peers.1 As another \nexample, consider the widespread negative effects of the COVID-  19 global pandemic on \neducational achievement, testing, and accountability ( Harmey & Moss, 2023 ).\nWhile assessment developers cannot plan on all possible contingencies—  especially those \ninvolving widespread technology outages or global pandemics—  they can consider basic \nadministration procedures that account for system integrity, backup, security, and resili -\nence and describe them for VATR documentation. Liao, Attali, Lockwood, and von Davier \n(2022)  provide a helpful discussion of what is required to maintain and monitor modern \ndigital assessments, and Ferrara (2017)  provides considerations to protect against test \nsecurity violations before, during, and after test administrations.\n23.2.7  Document Psychometric Analyses Supporting Validity, Reliability, \nand Fairness Claims, Including Details of AI Scoring Models\nThe broad set of psychometric analyses that developers typically use as evidence in support \nof validity claims is documented elsewhere ( AERA et al., 2014 ; Sireci & Benítez, 2023). \nHere, we suggest consideration beyond traditional estimates of reliability, content validity, \ncriterion-  related validity, and traditional fairness measures (e.g., subgroup differences, dif -\nferential item functioning (DIF) analyses) to reflect on how psychometrics and AI/  ML are \ncombining in the emerging field of computational psychometrics. LaFlair, Yancey, Settles, \nand von Davier (2023)  provide a compelling description of computational psychometrics \nand a consideration of “digital-  first assessments,” where ML and psychometrics are  \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 9 ---\nValidity Argument Roadmap for Automated Scoring\n477combined for item generation and scoring. These authors describe a real-  world assessment \ndevelopment following these principles in the form of the Duolingo English Test.\nDespite changing conceptions of psychometric analyses supporting validity arguments, \nany analytic attempts at developing validity evidence must be tightly coupled with the \ninitial validity arguments/  claims made in the first few steps outlined in Figure 23.1 . It is \nalso important to remember that validity-  related psychometric analyses exist at multiple \nlevels of abstraction and analysis. For example, Lottridge, Ormerod, and Jafari (2023)  \npoint out that validation approaches can focus on the construct, test, and/  or item levels. \nConstruct-  level evaluations might evaluate scoring models as they relate to the constructs, \nSIUs, and assessment tasks and consider methods for detecting unusual responses that \nsuggest the injection of construct-  irrelevant variance into scoring ( Lottridge et al., 2020 ). \nItem-  level analyses might compare the relationships between automated and human scores \nwith other measures, such as response length and overall test scores. In contrast, test-  level \nevaluations might focus on typical psychometric analyses such as item-  total correlations, \ntest reliabilities, etc. ( Lottridge et al., 2023 ).\nThe Standards  indicate that fairness is a “fundamental validity issue and requires \nattention throughout all stages of test development and use” ( AERA et al., 2014 , p. 49). \nThus, consistent with our comments above, all aspects of validity argumentation—  \nacross the entire roadmap—  must be considered regarding fairness implications. Kane \n(2010)  argued that fairness is critical to evaluating test consequences across all groups \nof test-  takers. Claims about fairness depend on evidence that the test supports its SIUs \nfor all individuals and all individual subgroups. For something like a VATR, fairness-  \nrelated analyses have historically focused on evidence of equitable treatment of test-  \ntakers through the assessment process and evidence supporting a lack of measurement \nbias ( AERA et al., 2014 ). This often takes the form of testing for differential functioning \nof items or test scores for test-  takers of equal ability across different groups. In add -\nition, claims related to fairness also center on process issues such as item/  test sensi -\ntivity reviews, standardization of testing procedures, and the use of accommodations for \ngroups such as those with disabilities.\nRecent testing guidelines expand upon these approaches to include issues directly related \nto the use of AI and automated scoring. The International Test Commission (ITC) and the \nAssociation of Test Publishers (ATP) released a comprehensive set of guidelines specifically \nfor technology-  based assessment ( ITC, 2022 ). The Society for Industrial and Organizational \nPsychology ( SIOP, 2023 ) released a publication titled Considerations and Recommendations \nfor the Validation and Use of AI-  Based Assessments for Employee Selection , which serves \nas a supplement to the ITC/  ATP guidelines. Such sources recommend evaluating the \nprocesses used in developing AI algorithms and tuning models, describing the samples used \nfor model building, explaining the features used in scoring, and documenting key facets of \nitem/  test content development, including consideration of how individuals with different \nbackgrounds might interact with test content and scoring algorithms.\nAlthough generally considered part of overall validity arguments, the topic of fairness \nhas continued to emerge as its own independent area of research and practice. In fact, \nHuggins-  Manley, Booth, and D’Mello (2022)  recently explored whether we require a more \nflexible approach to fairness arguments that occur outside of and complementary to val -\nidity arguments to address the many disparate views of fairness. Accordingly, these authors \noffered an argument-  based fairness approach to complement argument-  based validity for  \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 10 ---\nDavid Dorsey, Hillary Michaels, and Steve Ferrara\n478both traditional and AI-  enhanced assessments. Similarly, Johnson and McCaffrey (2023)  \nand Johnson, Liu, and McCaffrey (2022)  recently conducted in-  depth research into fairness \nfor automated scoring. Among the key ideas that these authors surfaced is a fundamental \nconception of fairness from the AI/  ML literature that involves three central definitions \n(building from the work of Barocas et al., 2019 ), namely:\n •Independence—  Predicted score M is independent of subgroups G\n •Separation—  Predicted score M is conditionally independent of subgroups G given the \ntrue score T; and\n •Sufficiency—  True score T is conditionally independent of subgroups G given the \npredicted score M.\nThe authors subsequently explore advanced empirical measures of fairness consistent with \nthese definitions.\n23.2.8  Document Reporting Procedures, Ensuring Alignment with Core \nInterpretation and Uses\nLike the discussion of test administration above, assessment developers do not always think \nof reporting as a key facet of validity argumentation. Yet, conventional wisdom is that if \nyou do not document it, it does not happen in terms of stakeholder perceptions. In add -\nition, one can foresee the standards for sufficient VATR development changing, hopefully \ntoward the consistent use of principled approaches ( Ferrara, Roussos, & Qin, 2023 ). Note \nalso that reporting requirements do not exist merely around technical documentation. Still, \nthere are increased calls for better reporting for actual assessment users and stakeholders \n(e.g., students, teachers, administrators, parents, and employers) ( Brown et al., 2023 ). In \nthe concurrent roles of information providers and/  or user experience designers, the develop -\nment of end-  user reports can be a critical link in the chain documenting validity reasoning. \nDescribing how a billion-  parameter LLM was used to generate items and assist with \nautomated scoring via a complex fine-  tuning and reinforcement learning approach is hard \nenough to understand and document among testing professionals, but imagine explaining \nthis in plain, understandable language to students, parents, or employers. Thus, practitioners \nshould consider key approaches for effective communication through end-  user reporting in \nVATR documentation.\n23.3 Discussion: Future Directions\nGiven that, as a field, we have been engaged in automated scoring for decades, one might \nthink it is figured out, including validity argumentation, right? So, what could go wrong? \nThe answer is a lot. While we have made amazing strides with incredible innovation in both \nscience and practice, the fundamental technological foundation of our work in automated \nscoring continues to evolve and shift. We have gone from general linear, additive models \nwith maybe a dozen scoring variables to potentially using LLMs with billions, if not \ntrillions, of parameters.\nMoreover, as discussed above, our validity documentation, in many ways, has never \nreally been as robust as it could be, with many VATRs reading like data dumps versus finely \ntuned and supported evidence-  based arguments. Of course, there are exceptions—  many do  \n  \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 11 ---\nValidity Argument Roadmap for Automated Scoring\n479this well, and hopefully, that number is increasing. So, where do we go from here? Based on \nour review of the literature and practice and our foundational roadmap presented above, \nhere are a few areas where we see potential growth, threats, and opportunities to enrich \nscience and practice.\n23.3.1  Future Area 1: More External Review\nOne possible trend we foresee is an increased call for external audits of AI systems, including \nautomated scoring systems. Within the educational domain, many systems already fall under \nexternal review standards of one type or another (e.g., U.S. Department of Education Peer \nReview standards, state, or district review standards), but these will likely grow in scope \nand importance. Similarly, professional certification organizations often attempt to meet the \nNational Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) Standards for the Accreditation of \nCertification Programs, which involves a significant amount of review. In the workplace domain, \nlaws are now being written and enforced, such as New York City’s (NYC) Department of \nConsumer and Worker Protection Automated Employment Decision Tools Local Law 144 \nof 2021, which regulates automated employment decision tools. This law, likely a forerunner \nof similar laws, requires that any entity hiring in NYC and using quantitative models to predict \nhiring success has to conduct an external audit, including validation and adverse impact ana -\nlyses, which can be made public. Many companies are already seeking to provide such auditing \nservices, yet the field has not agreed upon what auditing standards might look like. Moreover, \nthere are questions about who will “audit the auditors” ( Landers & Behrend, 2023 ). Landers \nand Behrend (2023)  provide a compelling set of potential audit components, including:\na) components related to AI models in terms of their source data, design, develop -\nment, features, processes, and outputs, b) components related to how information \nabout models and their applications are presented, discussed, and understood from \nthe perspectives of those employing the algorithm, those affected by decisions made \nusing its predictions, and third-  party observers, and c) meta-  components that must be \nconsidered across all other auditing components, including cultural context, respect \nfor persons, and the integrity of individual research designs used to support all model \ndeveloper claims\n(p. 36)\nMuch current AI/  ML development has happened through various public “competitions” \nmade famous by groups such as Kaggle. Perhaps the need is for fewer contests on things \nlike prediction power (in which cases the top leaderboard contenders often differ by insig -\nnificant decimal differences) and more contests on what a thorough audit would look like \n(see work on Stanford’s auditing contest).2\n23.3.2  Future Area 2: Increased Pace of Change and Complexity in AI\nIt is clear at this point that AI will increase in size, capacity, speed, and overall capabilities—  \nand that such changes will happen at expanding rates of change. We used to think funda -\nmental technological advancement was capped at the exponential rates of development \ndiscussed in Moore’s groundbreaking work ( Moore, 1965 ), which subsequently became \nMoore’s law. This law states that the speed and ability of computers doubles every two  \n   \n  \n\n--- Page 12 ---\nDavid Dorsey, Hillary Michaels, and Steve Ferrara\n480years as the number of transistors on a microchip increases. This development speed now \nseemingly pales in comparison to AI capacity development, which appears to be doub -\nling every few months. Thus, what will this mean for validity standards? How can our \nunderstanding and application of sound validity arguments keep pace with such changes? \nThis is an area in need of future research.\nOur opinion is that there is also a need to be clearer in research and practice on the \ndownsides of further AI development and implementation. The upsides can be obvious \nregarding jaw-  dropping capabilities in areas like automated scoring, automated item gener -\nation, etc. However, we seem to focus less on the potential costs, including those highlighted \nby researchers such as Bender and colleagues ( 2021 ). These include:\n •Languages—  90% of the world’s languages, spoken by over one billion people, currently \nhave limited support in terms of language-  related technologies.\n •Environment costs—  training a single LLM (without hyperparameter tuning) is estimated \nto require as much energy as a flight across the US. Such environmental costs may dis -\nproportionally affect disadvantaged people groups.\n •Massive data sources, such as those used to train LLMs, may encode biases and encode \ncertain historically biased associations (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity, and disability).\n •Size does not guarantee diversity. Much of the data used to train LLMs (such as the \nGenerative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models) is derived from Internet sources such \nas Reddit, Wikipedia, and certain books, which are not necessarily uniformly represen -\ntative of people groups. Note that a better approach for some specific use cases might \ninvolve careful curation and documentation of training data to truly support validity \narguments.\n •Values lock—  training data is necessarily generated in the past, and as societal views, \nbehaviors, and approaches change, AI model users can experience significant model/  \ndata drift, sometimes without detecting it. It is well established in the validity research \nliterature that the values held by assessment stakeholders can threaten the validity \nand fairness of test score interpretations and uses for different groups of examinees \n(Cronbach, 1976 ; Kane, 2006 ; Messick, 1989 ). If used in automated scoring and other \nmeasurement applications, we may have to extend this notion of value effects to data \nand models within the AI realm.\n •Legal/  regulatory—  the use of AI models, in particular emerging generative models such \nas LLMs, is bringing us into somewhat uncharted waters concerning (1) creating uncer -\ntainty about who owns AI-  created content; (2) unintentionally plagiarizing material, \nsuch as prior Internet content incorporated into an AI model as part of training; \n(3) causing security and/  or privacy concerns via activities such as inputting proprietary \ncompany information or sensitive information into a model when interacting with these \ntechnologies; (4) encountering concerns about the accuracy of the content created by \nthese technologies, which in some cases cannot be relied upon; (5) undermining tech -\nnical rigor, such as validity arguments; and (6) violating legal, contractual, or regulatory \nboundaries.\n •As mentioned above, many AI/  ML models are not capable of human-  level natural lan -\nguage understanding. Bender and colleagues ( 2021 ) point out that real language use \nrequires implicit shared mental states between humans—  often cultural; training data  \n    \n\n--- Page 13 ---\nValidity Argument Roadmap for Automated Scoring\n481does not include intent/  shared understandings of speaker–  receiver combinations. Thus, \nwe should ask ourselves, “how does this fundamentally limit our validity claims involving \nsuch models?”\nThese concerns are not intended to signal an anti-  AI perspective; our position is the \nopposite. By addressing such concerns directly and folding them into robust validity \narguments, the ultimate value of AI-  based automated scoring systems can be realized.\n23.3.3  Future Area 3: Continuing Challenges and Opportunities  \naround Fairness and Diversity\nAs discussed throughout this chapter, fairness as a concept is inextricably interwoven \nwith validity. This chapter has highlighted innovative thought and research occurring \nnow on these issues, and more will be required. However, it is important to acknowledge \nthat many researchers are broadening the search for more “fair” assessments, thus likely \nchanging our view of sufficient validity arguments. This broader view includes work on \nsocioculturally responsive assessment ( Bennett, 2023 ), balancing standardization with \nUNDERSTANDardization (Sireci, 2020), and discussions of justice-  oriented approaches \nto assessment ( Randall, 2021 ). How these areas of inquiry might ultimately impact what \nis included in VATRs is to be determined. However, the field is evolving. Our validity \narguments must evolve with it.\nNotes\n1 www.tn.gov/  educat  ion/ news/  2018/  7/ 19/ 2018-  tnre ady- sco res- show-  mixed-  resu lts- - enco urag ing- \nareas-  of- progr  ess.html\n2 https://  hai.stanf  ord.edu/  pol icy/ ai- audit-  challe  nge\nReferences\nAmerican Educational Research Association (AERA), American Psychological Association (APA), \nand National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME).

INTRODUCTION  \nIn recent years, natural language processing (NLP) has \nundergone a transformative shift driven by the emergence of \nlarge -scale pre -trained language models. These models have \nexhibited  notable  abilities  in understanding and producing  \nhuman -like content , setting new benchmarks across various \ntasks. The rapid evolution of these models has not only propelled \nthe development of more sophisticated NLP applications but \nalso sparked a deeper understanding of the potential and \nlimitations of artificial intellig ence.  \nLarge language models like BERT[1], RoBERTa [2], \nALBERT [3], GPT -3 [4], LLAMA [5], T5 [6], BLOOM [7], \nXLNeT [8], and GLM [9] have become cornerstones in the NLP \nresearch landscape. Their robust transformer -based \narchitectures and advanced pre -training tech niques have \ndemonstrated state -of-the-art performance on various \nbenchmarks, outperforming traditional machine learning and \nNLP methods. These models' impact spans numerous domains, \nincluding text generation, machine translation, summarization, \nsentiment a nalysis, question -answering, named entity \nrecognition, and more.  \nHowever, new challenges and limitations have emerged as \nthese models continue to grow in size and complexity. Issues \nrelated to model bias, interpretability, data privacy, and \nenvironmental impact have raised concerns among researchers \nand practitioners. Addressing these challenges has become a \npriority as the demand for more robust, efficient, and ethically \nsound AI systems grows.  A. BERT  \n(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), \ncommonly known as BERT, is a substantial transformer \narchitecture rooted in a language model. This model employs an \nencoder to pre -train extensive bidirectional representations \nderived from unlabel ed text . These representations can \nsubsequently undergo refinement to suit a diverse array of tasks \nwithin the realm of natural language processing (NLP), \nincluding but not limited to question -answering, sentiment \nanalysis, and text classification.  \nThe BERT algorithm, which stands for Bidirectional \nEncoder Representations from Transformers [10, 11], went \nthrough a two -step pre -training procedure that incorporated \nunsupervised task. The initial task, known as the Masked \nLanguage Modeling challenge, revolves ar ound predicting the \noriginal vocabulary IDs of words that have been intentionally \nmasked within the input text. This process draws upon the \ncontextual cues provided by both preceding and succeeding \nwords, leading to a substantial enhancement in BE RT's \ncapability to construct robust and comprehensive language \nrepresentations.  In contrast, the subsequent Next Sentence \nPrediction task is centered on discerning the logical connection \nbetween two given phrases. By engaging in this facet of training, \nthe BERT model develops the proficiency to adeptly manage \ntext pairs, ultimately fo stering a deeper comprehension of the \nintricate relationships that exist between distinct sentences . \nOnce large amounts of unlabeled data can be used to pre -\ntrain the BERT model, which can then be fine -tuned for certain \nNLP tasks . Fine -tuning involves initializing the BERT model \nwith pre -trained parameters and then training all its parameters \non a labeled downstream task, such as sentiment analysis or \nquestion answering. By fine -tuning BERT for particular tasks, it \ncan attain lead ing-edge performance on various NLP \nbenchmarks.  \nB. ALBERT  \nALBERT  is a modified  and lighter  version of the BERT \nmodel that aims to reduce memory consumption and increase \ntraining speed while maintaining or improving performance. It \nachieves this through different parameter sharing  techniques. \nThe first technique is parameter sharing, which involves using \nfactorized embedding parameterization to reduce the size of the \nembedding matrix and make more efficient use of memory.  \nThe second technique is called cross -layer parameter \nsharing, which shares parameters across layers to lower  the 2023 International Conference on Research Methodologies in Knowledge Management, Artificial Intelligence and Telecommunication Engineering (RMKMATE) | 979-8-3503-0570-8/23/$31.00 ©2023 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/RMKMATE59243.2023.10369423\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: York University.

These techniques significantly reduce the number of parameters compared to BERT, resulting in a smaller and faster model without sacrificing performance. Moreover, ALBERT introduces a self-supervised loss dedicated to sentence-order prediction (SOP), aimed at enhancing performance on benchmarks related to natural language understanding. The main objective of SOP is to enhance the connection between sentences and it is utilized as a solution to overcome the limitations of the original BERT's next sentence prediction (NSP) loss, which was found to be ineffective.  This design decision facilitates the expansion to larger ALBERT configurations, which, despite their amplified size, maintain fewer parameters than BERT-large. This results in improved performance on essential natural language understanding benchmarks such as GLUE [12], SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) [13], and RACE [14]. C. RoBERTa RoBERTa is a modified version of BERT that includes several key modifications. It undergoes longer training with larger batches and more data compared to BERT. It removes the next sentence prediction objective, which was found to be less effective. RoBERTa is trained on longer sequences without truncation, allowing it to learn from more context. It also uses a dynamic masking pattern during training to learn from a diverse set of examples. These modifications enhance RoBERTa's performance on diverse NLP tasks not limited to language modeling and question answering. D. GPT-3 An autoregressive language model called Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) was presented by OpenAI in 2020. By foreseeing the following token in a sequence based on the preceding tokens, it employs deep learning to generate text that resembles that of a human. GPT-3 can produce text that appears to have been authored by a person after receiving an initial text prompt. GPT-3 takes a different approach from GPT-2 [15], being a decoder-only transformer network. The key change involves alternating between dense and locally sparse attention patterns in the transformer's layers. This leads to GPT-3's ability to encompass a context window of 2048 tokens, twice the size of GPT-2's window, aligning more closely with the Sparse Transformer design. Additionally, GPT-3 comes in various model sizes, ranging from 125 million to a staggering 175 billion parameters, diverging from GPT-2, which was limited to a single size of 1.5 billion parameters. To equip GPT-3 with the ability to forecast the following token in a sequence relying on the tokens preceding it, a method called generative pre-training was employed. This process involved teaching the model language patterns and structures using an extensive dataset encompassing books, articles, and websites. Notably, GPT-3 displayed impressive zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities across various tasks, showcasing its proficiency even without prior task-specific training. This attribute positions GPT-3 as a powerful instrument for numerous NLP tasks, spanning from text generation to language translation. E. LLAMA LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) was created to aid the study of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. It is available in various sizes, ranging from 7B to 65B parameters, and was trained using publicly accessible data between December 2022 and February 2023. LLaMA was primarily intended for research purposes, including the development of techniques to improve the capabilities and limitations of current language models, investigating potential applications, and mitigating biases and risks associated with large language models. This model primarily caters to researchers engaged in AI, ML, and NLP domains. The primary goal of LLaMA is research, which includes the creation of strategies to enhance the capabilities and limitations of existing language models, scouting out prospective uses, and minimizing biases and dangers related to big language models.  LLaMA's architecture builds upon the transformer model, a powerful deep learning neural network widely recognized for its effectiveness in natural language processing. To improve training stability, LLaMA employs pre-normalization, which entails normalizing the input of each transformer sub-layer rather than the output. It also employs the RMSNorm [16] function for normalization and the SwiGLU  activation function to boost overall performance. Furthermore, LLaMA employs Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to encode position information in the input sequence. LLaMA is a basic model; hence it should not be used for downstream applications without first going through a risk assessment and mitigation procedure. Since it was not trained using human feedback, there is a possibility that it would produce objectionable or negative content, inaccurate data, or meaningless responses, as with any large language model. F. T5 An encoder-decoder model called T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is trained on a range of text-to-text jobs. It has been trained on both supervised and unsupervised activities, employing a special prefix for each task's input. This allows T5 to proficiently handle a wide range of tasks, offering immediate applicability. The model comes in various sizes, including t5-small, t5-base, t5-large, t5-3b, and t5-11b.. T5 is a powerful language model that can handle both supervised and unsupervised training. It uses a simplified version of layer normalization and a different position embedding scheme than the original Transformer. In T5, layer normalization is performed after the feedforward sublayer rather than before it, and the position embeddings are learned rather than fixed. The T5 language model is powered by both supervised and unsupervised training. It employs a different position embedding approach than the Transformer and a condensed form of layer normalization. In T5, the feedforward sublayer is applied first, followed by layer normalization, and the position embeddings are learned as opposed to fixed. \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: York University.

Restrictions apply. \n\n--- Page 3 ---\nT5's training incorporates instructor forcing, which mandates the availability of an input sequence along with its associated target counterpart. The input sequence is supplied to the model using input IDs, while the target sequence, modified with a start-sequence token and adjusted accordingly, is fed into the decoder using decoder input IDs. In a teacher-forcing manner, the End-Of-Sequence (EOS) token is linked to the goal sequence. Beyond the original T5 model, Google introduced additional versions such as T5v1.1, mT5, byT5, UL2, Flan-T5, and Flan-UL2. Each of these models features distinct adaptations and pre-training strategies. G. BLOOM BLOOM, which stands for the BigScience Large Open-science Open-access Multilingual Language Model, was introduced at the BigScience Workshop in 2022. Developed and launched through a collaborative effort involving hundreds of researchers, BLOOM stands as a language model boasting 176 billion parameters. It underwent training across 46 natural languages and 13 programming languages. BLOOM, a causal decoder-only model, aligns with other advanced language models featuring over 100 billion parameters. However, BLOOM introduces certain alterations to the foundational Transformer architecture. These adaptations encompass the integration of ALiBi (Attention with Linear Biases) positional embeddings [17] and the incorporation of an extra layer normalization subsequent to the initial embedding layer. BLOOM's architecture embraces two significant divergences. Firstly, the utilization of ALiBi Positional Embeddings results in the attenuation of attention scores based on the distance between keys and queries. This strategic approach fosters smoother training and enhances downstream performance, even at the original sequence length. This achievement outperforms the outcomes of learned and rotary embeddings. Secondly, a supplementary layer normalization was inserted following the first embedding layer. This inclusion serves to mitigate training instabilities, ultimately bolstering training stability. However, it does come at the expense of zero-shot generalization. The preliminary experimentation phase operated with float16, while the conclusive training phase employed bfloat16. This choice has the potential to alleviate the necessity for the embedding LayerNorm. H. XLNet XLNet is a generalized autoregressive pre-training method that aims to overcome the limitations of BERT and other autoregressive language models. This is achieved through an innovative pre-training objective that optimizes the anticipated log-likelihood of sequences across all conceivable permutations of factorization orders.  This enables XLNet to learn bidirectional contexts and capture more complex relationships between tokens in a sequence. In conjunction with its pioneering pre-training objective, XLNet enhances architectural designs by incorporating Transformer-XL's segment recurrence mechanism and relative encoding scheme. This strategic integration bolsters performance, particularly for tasks entailing extended text sequences. To address the ambiguity of the factorization order in permutation-based language modeling, XLNet proposes a reparameterization of the Transformer(-XL) network. This refinement facilitates more efficient learning, resulting in superior performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks encompassing language comprehension, reading comprehension, text classification, and document ranking. Overall, XLNet signifies a substantial leap forward in autoregressive language modeling, showcasing remarkable achievements across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Its capability to understand bidirectional contexts and surpass the constraints of preceding autoregressive models positions it as an indispensable tool for professionals and experts working within the natural language processing domain. I. GLM The framework of the General Language Model (GLM) is centered around autoregressive blank infilling, which results in notable enhancements over conventional blank filling pretraining methods, resembling the techniques employed in T5. GLM employs a unique approach: it randomly removes consecutive token sequences from input text, prompting the model to progressively reconstruct these removed segments. Augmented by span shuffling and 2D positional encoding, GLM improves on previous techniques and yields substantial performance gains. Through adjustments in the number and lengths of blanks, GLM can be pre-trained for a wide range of tasks. This allows it to excel in natural language understanding (NLU) and various forms of text generation tasks, including both conditional and unconditional scenarios. This is achieved through multi-task learning, combining diverse pretraining objectives. Drawing inspiration from Pattern-Exploiting Training (PET) [20], GLM transforms NLU tasks into carefully crafted cloze-style questions, capturing the intricacies of human language. It's inherently capable of handling cloze questions that necessitate multi-token responses, accomplished through autoregressive blank filling techniques. In summary, GLM marks a significant advancement in autoregressive language modeling. It demonstrates remarkable prowess across a broad spectrum of natural language processing tasks, thanks to its versatile pretraining capabilities and proficiency in managing multi-token responses. This positions GLM as a valuable tool for researchers and professionals engaged in the field of natural language processing.. Table 1 provides an overview of various language models, including their descriptions, architectures, pre-training methods, and key features. II. CONCLUSION Large-scale pre-trained language models have completely changed the NLP field. They've shown remarkable abilities and raised the bar for various tasks. These models have revolutionized NLP application development and deepen our understanding of AI's potential. However, their enormous size and complexity have brought new challenges such as bias, \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: York University.

It's crucial to address these challenges to create more reliable, efficient, and ethical AI systems. By collaborating and pushing the boundaries of innovation, the NLP community can unlock the full potential of large-scale language models.

Research findings and other forms of scholarship can be disseminated through formal methods such as articles published in peer-reviewed journals, which are critiqued by experts prior to publication and in many cases rigorously edited, and presentations at conferences. Informal communication methods, such as reports at meetings, online discussions, and social media, provide immediate and broad dissemination of information, although that information may not have been evaluated for its accuracy, lack of bias, or whether it is misleading. \nA process transformed. The scholarly communication pro-\ncess has shifted over time with the wide availability of information that can be accessed online. Du and colleagues analyzed articles on scholarly communication from 1996 to 2021 to explore trends and areas of research.\n1 Their study revealed that social media and \ndigitalization have transformed dissemination from research find-ings and other information only being shared through articles in peer-reviewed journals to broad and open dissemination using social media platforms, such as X (formerly Twitter) and Bluesky, and digital repositories, such as those available through universi-ties, preprint servers like medRxiv (www.medrxiv.org), and data repositories such as the Center for Open Science (www.cos.io).\nOVERVIEW OF AI TYPES\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a broad category that encompasses many processes and tools. Specifically for scholarly communica-tions, natural language processing, machine learning, deep learn-ing, large language models, and generative AI (genAI) are the bases for the tools used most frequently and are subcategories of AI. Natural language processing includes various methods that use the rules of written language (computational linguistics) to recog-nize, analyze, and generate text along with recognizing tone and sentiment. Machine learning is a method of improving predictions on future data by training (and retraining) the models on known examples and data. Deep learning, which relies on a machine learn-ing process, uses many layers of neural networks to train the pre-dictive models on handling unstructured data—such as reports and pictures—so that the model will “think” more like a human brain would. The large in large language model refers to the data \nparameters: the different factors that affect the behavior of how the model is defined. There can be upward of over a trillion param-eters with currently available technology. These parameters allow the large language models to generate human-understandable Using Artificial Intelligence for Scholarly \nWriting \nGuidelines for nurse authors\nBy Marilyn H. Oermann, PhD, RN, ANEF , FAAN, Jacqueline K. Owens, PhD, RN, CNE, Heather Carter-Templeton, \nPhD, RN, NI-BC, FAAN, Gabriel Peterson, PhD, and Hannah E. Bailey, MS\nABSTRACT\nThe widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) continues to transform the scholarly communication process. \nWith wide access to genAI tools, authors now not only have the benefits these tools can provide, such as creation of text, tables, and figures, but also the responsibility to use these tools with integrity and transparency. Examples of concerns about the use of genAI tools include ethical and legal breaches; inaccurate, biased, or fabricated content; and lack of accountability. Given the potential for serious harm to patients as well as the undermining of the credibility of scholarly communication with the use of unchecked content, it is essential for nurse authors to also include their judgment and subject matter expertise in the preparation of a scholarly manuscript that includes AI-generated information. This article offers a brief overview of recent research findings related to the use of genAI tools to support scholarly writing and provides guidelines for clinicians, educators, and other nurse authors on the appropriate use of AI in the preparation of manuscripts. Information is also provided about authorship, accuracy of content and references, biases and misrep-resentations within AI-generated content, plagiarism, and appropriate disclosure of AI tools in manuscript preparation.Keywords: AI bias, chatbots, generative artificial intelligence, scholarly communication, writing for publicationOPEN\nMarilyn H.

This con-\ntent can be text, images, music, and other forms. It should be noted that all these tools, methods, and models are only as good as the data used to train them. \nTHE SURGE OF genAI USE IN SCHOLARLY \nCOMMUNICATION\nIt is impossible for anyone with even minimal involvement with scholarly communication to miss the fact that a transformation of the process is occurring now with genAI tools, such as Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT, OpenAI), Anthrop-ic’s Claude, and others. A survey in 2023 of more than 1,600 sci-entists revealed that 30% were using genAI tools to help pre-pare manuscripts.\n3 In 2024, a survey of approximately 3,000 \nresearchers and health care professionals worldwide indicated that most (96%) had heard of AI, including genAI, and 54% had used it; importantly, 95% of the respondents believed that AI will have a significant impact on their work.\n4 Among all of the \ngenAI tools, ChatGPT is the most well-known. This is not sur -\nprising. After ChatGPT was released to the public in November 2022, in only five days, it had reached over 1 million users. As of July of this year, ChatGPT.com was receiving more than 4.6 billion visits per month, with users sending 2.5 billion prompts daily.\n5 \nAuthors are using genAI to search for information and create \nnew content for manuscripts; develop outlines; draft, revise, and edit manuscripts; generate tables, figures, and illustrations; trans-late text into other languages; and for general administrative tasks. Many publishers, rightfully concerned about preserving the accu-racy and integrity of the work they publish during this time of rapid change in authorship processes, have sought to define or limit the use of genAI by authors in certain ways. For example, most pub-lishers will not allow images and illustrations that have been cre-ated using genAI. GenAI can produce images that appear real but are fake, potentially leading to image fraud with a serious impact on science and the scientific literature.\n6,7 \nNg and colleagues surveyed more than 2,100 medical research-\ners in 2023 to assess their attitudes toward the use of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT.\n8 Benefits of AI-powered chatbots identified by \nrespondents included time saved on drafting manuscripts, lan-guage translation, and creating figures and tables. More than half (61.8%) rated AI chatbots as very helpful or helpful for general administrative tasks. Examples of challenges when using AI for research included lack of information about how AI chatbots devel-oped responses (77.2%); ethical and legal issues (76.8%); the inabil-ity of chatbots to reflect the “nuances and complexity” of research-ers’ perspectives and reasoning (76.4%); lack of accountability (73%); and privacy issues (72.9%).\n8 The use of AI chatbots has \nsteadily increased in the two years since these findings, and researcher attitudes are likely to have shifted in some ways as well. But these researchers’ concerns remain widespread and serve as a reminder that while genAI can perform many tasks associated with scientific writing, every manuscript needs humans who are experts in the topic to ensure accuracy and relevance of the content. The use of AI models, as they are refined and grow more powerful, will continue to develop in predictable and less predictable ways, but they cannot replace the expertise of clini-cians, educators, and researchers. GUIDELINES FOR USING AI FOR SCHOLARLY \nWRITING\nA recent study found that the majority of nursing journals did not \nhave specific guidance related to the use of AI included in the information for authors.\n9 Among 258 nursing journals, 74.42% did \nnot have any sections or instructions for authors in their author guidelines about using genAI or other types of AI tools in prepar -\ning manuscripts for submission to the journal. Only 27.13% of the journals referred authors to the publisher for this guidance. \nAlthough the multiple uses of AI for scholarly writing are still \nevolving, there are some general guidelines that clinicians, edu-cators, and nurse authors should follow when preparing a manu-script. This article provides the guidelines below on the appropri-ate use of AI tools in the preparation of manuscripts. These guide-lines were developed based on a search of the literature from 2019 to 2025 in CINAHL Complete, PubMed, and Scopus; a review of recommendations from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, Committee on Publication Ethics, and World Asso-ciation of Medical Editors; and guidance published in 2023 in JAMA  \non the use of AI in scholarly writing. \nDo not list an AI tool as one of the authors. Based on Inter -\nnational Committee of Medical Journal Editors standards, authors need to meet four criteria\n10: \n•\n Make a substantial contribution to the \nwork or the acquisition, \nanalysis, or interpretation of the data. \n•\n P\narticipate in drafting a portion of the paper or in revising it. \n•\n Approve the final manuscript.\n \n•\n Be accountable for the accur\nacy and integrity of the work. \nAn AI tool cannot approve the final version of a paper (criterion \n3) and cannot be held accountable for the accuracy and integrity of the content (criterion 4). With authorship comes accountability for the work, and none of the AI tools can assume this responsi-bility.\n11 A position statement about AI and authorship from the \nCommittee on Publication Ethics and recommendations from the World Association of Medical Editors also add that AI tools cannot indicate conflicts of interest, which is required for submission of a manuscript, or agree to (and sign) copyright requirements.\n12,13 \nEnsure content and references are accurate. The author of \na manuscript is responsible for the accuracy and relevance of the content produced by AI tools. When AI tools are used to generate content and to assist with writing and other tasks related to pre-paring the manuscript, the author is responsible for the integrity of the content.\n14 GenAI can quickly create content, tables, figures, \nand other documents for a manuscript, but the information it uses is derived from a wide range of sources on the Internet that are used for its training. These sources include peer-reviewed articles \nPhoto by Laurence Dutton / iStock.\n\n--- Page 3 ---\n54  AJN | Vol. 125, Issue 11  | November 2025that are open access (freely available online to read), as well as \nother articles that are behind a paywall (require a subscription or willingness to pay for the article), but where publishers have autho-rized access to them for use in training large language models.\n15 \nIn addition to articles that are peer-reviewed, books, proceedings, websites, blog posts, social media, and other information are also used for training, and this information is generally not first evalu-ated by experts. The information generated by AI tools may not be accurate and may not be relevant to the focus of the paper. The content derived from AI also may not be comprehensive because AI tools generate information based on their training and what-ever was available on the Internet at that time.\nIt is well-known that AI tools may list citations (in the text) and \nreferences (in the list at the end of a paper) that are fake (often called “hallucinations”), may not be related to the topic of the paper, and may have errors in them. In a 2023 study by Walters and Wilder, slightly more than one-half (55%) of the ChatGPT-3.5 and 18% of the GPT-4 citations were fabricated; many of the actual (nonfabricated) references had errors in them (such as incorrect author names, vol-ume, issue, or page numbers); and many had one or more Ameri-can Psychological Association (APA) style errors, such as incorrect capitalization of the article title.\n16 In another study that evaluated \nthe accuracy of citations and references in two different fields (sci-ences and humanities), of 102 citations, only 72.7% in the sciences and 76.6% in the humanities were real (actually existed in the liter -\nature).\n17 In addition, only 70.9% (sciences) and 74.5% (humanities) \nof the references listed were relevant to the topic of the paper. The digital object identifier (DOI), a string of numbers and letters that identifies a specific article or other document, was real in 70.9% of the references from the sciences but in only 38.3% of those in the humanities; the other DOIs were made up by ChatGPT.\nKacena and colleagues had ChatGPT write a scientific review \narticle.\n18 Although AI reduced the time needed to write the article, \nthe article required extensive review and time to confirm accu-racy. Up to 70% of the references had errors. Concerns about inac-curacies and errors in references when using AI tools have also been discussed in nursing.\n19-21 A key implication is that authors \nshould not use AI to obtain references. Check for biases and misrepresentations with AI-generated \ncontent. Because AI tools are trained using diverse sources of \ninformation created by individuals and groups with potential biases, the content (text and images) generated using AI may con-tain biases based on race, gender, age, disabilities, and other areas. For example, an AI tool may create text and images that consis-tently depict the nurse as female and the physician as male. In one study, chatbots were two times more likely to predict Black people and Native American people as oncology nurses rather than oncologists, compared with Asian people.\n22 They also were \nmore likely to predict women as oncology nurses rather than men. In another study in Australia, even though half of the paramedics are women, 100% (N = 32) of the images of paramedics and ambu-lance officers produced using genAI were portrayed as men, as White people, and as people with light skin tone.\n23 \nFang and colleagues evaluated the gender and racial biases in \ncontent generated by seven different AI tools, including ChatGPT.24 \nThey found that the content included significant gender and racial bias against women and Black people. It is important for authors using genAI for gathering information and preparing manuscripts to confirm that the AI-generated text and the language they use themselves in drafting the paper avoid bias. \nEnsure content generated from an AI tool is not plagia-\nrized. One of the concerns with using genAI is the issue of plagia-\nrism. AI tools create content (and tables, figures, images, and other material) from previously published material used for training and may not specify their source.\n13 It is up to the author to establish \nthat the material was not taken from a published article or other document. Before using any AI-generated content, authors should check the output to ensure it does not contain sentences or phrases from published text. One strategy to check for plagiarism in the AI text is to run the text through plagiarism checker software, which will scan the AI text for similarities against published content. Sim-ilar content can then be reviewed to determine if citations are needed. If the author does not have this software available in their setting, they can search online for a free plagiarism checker. The free versions, however, often have restrictions as to the number of words they search and may not be as accurate or thorough. \nDisclose how and where AI tools were used in preparing \nthe manuscript. Authors need to be transparent in their use of \nAI tools. While some AI-generated text may be apparent to editors and peer reviewers, it is often difficult to distinguish this from orig-inal text written by the author. In a study comparing abstracts pub-lished in journals with abstracts generated by ChatGPT, only a few of the ChatGPT abstracts were successfully identified.\n25 Without \ntransparency, articles may be disseminating content produced using AI tools that is not accurate, among other concerns. Some studies have attempted to identify words and phrases that have appeared recently in articles and may indicate text that was cre-ated using AI.\n26-28 A study of the nursing literature found several \nnouns and verbs that increased significantly in articles starting in 2023, after AI tools became available to the public. For example, the word intricate increased by 435% in nursing articles and delv-\ning by 365%.\n26 \nWhen AI is used for producing drafts of text; revising content; \nand creating tables, figures, and illustrations for a manuscript, this needs to be disclosed in the manuscript, and the prompts and out-put should be provided in the text or as supplemental con-tent.\n10,13,20,29,30 The author should state how the AI was used and Example of a Statement Disclosing Use of \nan AI Tool in a Manuscript\nText\nChatGPT (version GPT-4o) created the scenarios used in the two simulations on recognizing patient deterioration. The scenarios were evaluated for accuracy, misrepresentation, and bias by the authors followed by two nurse educators not involved in the study and were revised based on their feedback. The authors accept responsibility for the content in the scenarios. \nReference \nUsing American Medical Association (AMA) reference style: ChatGPT. Version GPT-4o. OpenAI; 2024.

The intent is to make the AI-generated con-\ntent clear to editors, peer reviewers, and readers. \nA statement can be added in an acknowledgment on the title page \nor prior to the references. The information about the genAI should include: the name of the AI software and version number, manufac-turer, date it was used, and details about how AI was used and where in the manuscript.\n31,32 Guidance from JAMA Network also recommends \nthat authors confirm that they assume responsibility for the content.32 \nSee Example of a Statement Disclosing Use of an AI Tool in a Manu-\nscript. Helpful resources for referencing AI in a manuscript include the APA Style Blog ( https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt),\n33 \nAPA Publishing Policies,34 and the AMA Manual of Style.35 Because \nmany grammar-correcting software programs now have embed-ded AI to analyze text, correct grammar, and provide suggestions to improve writing, authors should also disclose when one of these programs was used in preparing the manuscript. \nCONCLUSIONS\nSince the appearance of AI tools in 2023, their adoption by research-ers, clinicians, and authors has been rapid and is still growing. Lit-tle mystery exists about this enthusiastic embrace—AI tools make work easier. However, the limitations of AI (including lack of account-ability and known problems with hallucinations and biased datas-ets) are also becoming better understood. Additionally, the internal logic of AI “reasoning” is often opaque to users. Unaddressed, these issues will begin to erode the quality and reliability of scientific lit-erature, which is used to build evidence to guide clinical practices. \nThere are many uses of genAI for writing manuscripts about \nclinical studies and projects, but human expertise is essential to ensure the accuracy, relevance, and comprehensiveness of the content; that the content does not represent only one perspective and is not biased; that the text is not plagiarized and is attributed to the original authors; and that the references are actual publica-tions, are relevant, and do not contain errors. Established author standards still apply when using AI; the use of new tools does not shift these responsibilities. Because articles may be used as evi-dence for clinical practice and as the basis of future research, it is important to disclose how and where AI tools were used through all phases of the project or study, and in preparing the manuscript. This is essential so the results are reproducible and can be used to build the evidence base for sound clinical practices.\n ▼\nREFERENCES\n 1. Du D , Ding J, Chen Y . Liu C.

They teach an undergraduate pro-gram,theBachelorofLaws(LLB),andapostgraduatecertiﬁcateinLaws(PCLL).The English for Law course is taught to ﬁrst-year law students, and its focus is onacademic legal reading and writing skills. The more professional writing skills\nare left to the PCLL program. The English course was developed in 1993 in\nresponse to Law Faculty dissatisfaction with the language-skill training they wereoﬀering themselves. The EAP and Law teachers agreed that the best way forwardwouldbetoattempttodeliveracoursewhichdovetailedverycloselywithoneoftheﬁrst-yearLawcourses—thelawoftort.Thereweretwomainreasonsforthischoice.Experience with other disciplines—Engineering, Architecture, Medicine, Social Sci-ences—hadtoldusthatlanguageproblemsinourESL-mediumtertiarycurriculumwere best addressed using the language in the target study context, with materials\nthat were discipline-based and patently relevant to the students’ core curricular\nneeds. Our experience had also told us that the higher the relative English compe-tence of the incoming students, the less willing they are to devote a chunk oftheir schedule studying communication skills in isolation from their curriculum.The incoming Law students traditionally have among the highest school-leavingEnglishgradesintheUniversity,soitwasclearthatforthecoursetobeacceptedbythe students we would need to go the extra mile to learn about one of their dis-ciplinary subjects. We chose Tort, which is the branch of common law concerned\nwithprovidingacivilremedytopersonsharmedbythecarelessorintentionalcon-\nduct of others. Our course narrowed its focus to Negligence, the core of the ﬁrst-yeartortcurriculum.\n2\n3.2. Curriculumdesign\nThe English for Law course is a ﬁrst-year course (in a 3-year curriculum) which\nrunsforthewholeacademicyear,withtwomeetinghoursperweekover24teaching\nweeks,andcomprisescontinuousassessmentandaﬁnalexam.Theauthenticmate-\nrials used are two major and challenging types of legal document, central to anyLawstudent’sorpractitioner’slife:thecasereportandthestatute.Putverybrieﬂy,case reports are lengthyverbatim reports of the judgments of court cases—notablythoseofthehighercourtsofappeal,whilestatutes,knownasActsofParliamentintheUKandordinancesinHongKong,arethebodyoflegislationthatattemptsto\n2ForadetailedaccountofhowthecoursewasnegotiatedbetweentheEnglishandLawteachers,see\nAllison,Corcos,andLam(1994):‘‘Layingdownthelaw?Reﬂectingoncoursedesigninprogress’’N.Bruce/EnglishforSpeciﬁcPurposes21(2002)321–345 323\n\n--- Page 4 ---\nregulate social and economic practice.

The theory ofthis kind oftesting is that this is just what lawyers dowhenclientsappearintheiroﬃcesandtellthemabouttheirproblems(Conley&O’Barr,1998,p.133).\nIt was logical to culminate the course with a writing phase centered on the Pro-\nblemQuestion(PQ),givenitsrelevancetothestudents’ﬁnalexams.Thecumulative\ndesign of the course was also deliberate, as the analytical skills, reasoning patternsand rhetorical structures needed to answer the PQ were all covered in teaching thecasereportandordinancereadingskillsearlierinthecourse.\n3.3. LegalvsLinguisticknowledge\nThe question of balance between knowledge of, and focus upon, language and\ncontent is one of the perennial issues of debate in EAP. In the domain of EAP for\nlaw, Vijay Bhatia (1993) suggests that the primary task of the ESP teacher is toensurestudents’ability\ntoappreciatewhichfactsofthecasearelegallymaterial,distinguish(ing)them\nfromthosethatarelegallyimmaterial,(todecide)whetheranearlierdecisionorrule of law is relevant, whether a particular case is distinguishable fromanother,andtodeducetheratiodecidendi\n3ofthecase(p.176)\nThis advice invites the criticism, identiﬁed by Spack (1988) and elaborated by\nHowe in an English for Law context (1993), that EAP teachers will be seen asoverreaching themselves and pretending to an expertise that they can only feign orsimulate.Inthecontextofourcourse,andoftherelationshipwehavewiththeLawdepartment, the EAP teacher needs to be careful to distinguish between a role in\n3In the USA this would be called the ‘‘holding’’, the process of reasoning by which a legal rule or\nprincipleisappliedtothespeciﬁcfactsofacase.324 N.Bruce/EnglishforSpeciﬁcPurposes21(2002)321–345\n\n--- Page 5 ---\nidentifying legal reasoning and rhetorical moves and structures (rhetorical knowl-\nedge), and a role in arbitrating on points of law (substantive knowledge). Whilelawyers see these processes as inextricable from each other, it is language teachers’\ngeneral rhetorical knowledge, in terms of argument and reasoning patterns, that\nformstheessentialbridgebetweentheirowncoreareaofexpertiseandthestudents’content curriculum, notably those written assignments that are the law teacher’sprincipalmeansofevaluatingastudents’graspofthatcontent.ThemostimportantknowledgetheEAPteacherneedsisthesequence—orportfolio—oflegalreasoningmoves relevant to the written genre in question: in our case, the problem questionanswer.

Students can ﬁnd it confusing when theteacher asks what the defendant’s counsel is ‘‘doing’’ in terms of a legal reasoningsequence, rather than simply ‘‘saying’’ in terms of substantive law. This is why wefelt it was important to make clear to students what we were trying to do in struc-\nturingthecoursearoundalanguage-contentspectrum:\nIamnotsuggestingthatEAPteachersoflegaldiscourseabandonanyattemptto\nprepare themselves to answer substantive questions of law.

The following diagram illustratesthisrelationshipasaspectrum,fromthelegaltothelinguistic:\nThis spectrum provides a framework for the analysis and teaching of the dis-\ncourse patterns in any genre. I suggest to the students that the most eﬀectiveway for them to improve their academic legal writing is to follow a functional\napproach to their analysis of case reports: identifying the facts that give rise to\nissues, the applicationoflegalprinciplestothosefacts,andthejudges’conclusionson each issue. This functional sequence can then be applied to the analysis of theproblem question, and to the writing of the PQ answer. The course is deliberatelycumulative in design, with the rhetorical functions recycled through the three gen-res of case report, ordinance and problem question answer to ensure maximumuptake.\nThe following diagram shows how I applied this spectrum to each of the three\nlegalgenresweaddressinthiscurriculum,culminatinginthewritinggenreIaddress\ninthispaper:thelegalProblemQuestionAnswer(PQA).326 N.Bruce/EnglishforSpeciﬁcPurposes21(2002)321–345\n\n--- Page 7 ---\nThere is no space here to discuss the interdiscursive dimension to our serial but\ncumulativetreatmentofthesethreegenres.Thejudgmentsinthecasereportfeature\nthecorereasoningandrhetoricalmovesthatitisintendedthestudentshouldapply\nin their problem question answers, while statutes oﬀer the opportunity for theintensive analysis of rhetorical structures expressing circumstance, condition andcontingency—linguistically complex but essential to any realistic legal pronounce-ment.

And then was the damage too\nremote to have been foreseen by the defendant? Balanced against all of these con-siderations are possible defences that the defendant might have that would enable\nhim or her either to escape liability altogether, or to reduce it by arguing con-\ntributory negligence on the part of the victim. Students are expected to place anynegligence problem against this legal reasoning framework. Appendix B shows indiagrammatic terms how the IPCAC reasoning sequence\n8is applied to whichever\nissue is relevant to the problem at hand. In this problem, the issue is simply toestablish whether the defendant owed a duty to take reasonable care not to causeinjury (in this case psychiatric injury, or nervous shock ) to any or all of the ﬁve\npotentialplaintiﬀs.\n5.1.2.

These are skills the students will need as practicing lawyers,notablyasbarristers.Tobeeﬀectivebeforeacourt,counselneedtobeseentotakeaccount of the opposition’s actual or likely arguments, objections and/or defences.These same skills are clearly being solicited in the instructions in a typical PQA,which invariably ask students to advise one or more parties on the extent of theirliability (as defendant), or on their chances of succeeding in their legal action (asplaintiﬀ).\nWhilewefeltwehadbeengivingstudentstherightrhetoricaladviceandfeedback,\nthecriticalcommentsfromtheTortteacher promptedustoreviewourteachingofPQA writing skills. We would need to work harder at ensuring that students wereable toestimate notonly whether apartywas likely tobesuccessfulin their claim,buttodiscriminateamongthefactsandissuesandtoidentifywhat—onthefactsandgiven the current state ofthe law—layopen to argument. Diﬀerent teachers respon-ded to this feedback in diﬀerent ways; in this paper I discuss how I adapted myteaching of PQA writing skills. I developed a ‘‘heuristic’’ device that I hoped would\nhelpstudentsbothwiththeirreasoningandwiththeorganisationoftheirwriting.\nIn the problem I use as an example in this paper, there are ﬁve parties, and the\nfacts are varyingly favourable or unfavourable for each of them. I devised the fol-lowing answer ‘‘template’’ to enable students to quickly show whether the partiesfulﬁll—orfailto fulﬁll—the criteria that qualify them for recovery of damages for\nnervous shock. We advise them to pay particular attention to those facts or issueswhichmightgiverisetodebate,thatis,wherethefactsoftheproblemarenotneatlyanalogous to those of a precedent case. Students were advised to use ticks ( @),\ncrosses(X) andquestionmarks (?),respectively, toindicate if, in their opinion,the\nparty did or did not fulﬁl the criteria, or whether the point was arguable. Thisscheme was intended to help students determine whether or not the parties werelikely to succeed in their action. The following table shows the recommended‘‘answers’’(n/a=notapplicabletothatparty):\nN.Bruce/EnglishforSpeciﬁcPurposes21(2002)321–345 331\n\n--- Page 12 ---\nThe most successful students are those who manage to cut through the obvious\nfactstothe arguableandpotentially critical issues(e.g.thosemarkedby‘‘?’’inthetable),butwehavefoundthatevensomeofthosestudentsﬁnditdiﬃculttotrans-\nlatesuccessfulreasoningintosuccessfulwriting.\n5.2.

The inductive onewould lay outthe com-ponentsofanargumentandthendrawaconclusionattheend,whilethedeductivestylewouldbeginwiththeconclusion,andthenproceedtojustifyordemonstrateits\nlogicviafactualargument.HowdotheseprinciplesapplytothePQAlegalgenre?In\nlegalproblemquestionanswers,thetextbooks(e.g.Williams,1982)unambiguouslyadvisestudentstoworkfromthefacts,buthowtheanalysisandargumentarebestpresented have received less attention. If the argument students are to present issimple and clear-cut, in the absence of any arguable issues, then a deductive struc-ture might be the most eﬃcient. Howe (1990) suggests that PQAs should begin, ateachaction,witha‘‘forecast’’ofthelikelyoutcome.Butfrontingtheconclusionforeachpartyinthiswaymaysignaltotheexaminerthattheoverallissueofwhetherthese\nplaintiﬀs can recover damages is seen by the students as an invariably straightfor-\nward one. I would argue that the strategy appropriate to a more problematic andcontingent argument is to signal that complexity but to delay the conclusion. Forexample,regardingthefollowinganalysisofElaine’ssituation,ifthestudentwantstosuggestherchancesofsuccessfulrecoveryarenothigh(andthefactsdosuggestthis), then the student could begin by pointing to the problem she faces, which ispersuading the court that being ‘‘ told of the accident and (seeing) Alan’s burnt and\nmutilated body at the hospital ’’ qualiﬁes that encounter with her husband’s body as\nbeing in the ‘‘immediate aftermath’’ of the accident, a key criterion for recovery in\nnervousshock.HereisasuggestedPQAanalysisofElaine’scase:332 N.Bruce/EnglishforSpeciﬁcPurposes21(2002)321–345\n\n--- Page 13 ---\nAlthough Elaine, asAlan’s wife, will be assumed to have had a close relation-\nship oflove andaﬀection with him, hercase is weakened by her absence fromthe scene of the accident. To qualify her shock as recoverable she will need to\nargue that her nervous shock resulted in seeing her husband’s mutilated body\nrather than from being told about the accident (Alcock 1991), and that shearrived at the hospital within 2 hours of the accident, a period adjudged in\nMcLoughlin(1981)toqualifyasthe‘‘immediateaftermath’’ofanaccident\nIn this answer, because of the degree of contingency on which likely success\ndepends, the conclusion is woven into the argument. I generally advise students toplay it safe and formally conclude witha separate statement of the party’s chances\nofsuccess,asillustratedinthelaterreformulationexamples,or,iftheparty’scaseis\nclear-cut,tobeginwiththeirassessmentoftheparty’schancesofsuccess(i.e.eitherveryhighorverylow).\n5.3. Teachinglanguageviacontent:fromcontenttolanguage\nIngeneralthen,theorganizationalstrategythatweconcentrateoninourcourseis\nthe inductive one, as students are advised to try to ﬁnish their paragraph on each\nissue in each action with either their concluding position or their main proposition\ninsupportofthatconclusion.Togettothepointofbroachingthisdimensionwiththe students, we make sure we have tapped the students’ understanding of legalanalysis,interpretingthefactsandapplyinglegalprinciples.Inshort,westartfromacontentperspectiveandensurethatstudentsﬁrsttackletheproblemthroughlegalanalysis and reasoning. We use the table above as a means of raising their under-standingofanalyticandinterpretivestrategies,identifyingthematerialfacts,thekeyissues, and any relevant routines that ﬁt the area of law—i.e. procedural legal\nknowledge. They are then asked to write their ﬁrst draft answer. There has been\nlittle attention to paragraph organization or language at this stage. This will betackledoncetheteacherhasreadtheﬁrstdrafts.\nAt the ﬁrst, draft stage, we would expect the student to have been able to say\nwhether or not s/he thinks that a party has a case in a particular area of law andthen proceed to go through the sequence of possible issues. Typically, this wouldcomprise the need to demonstrate that the defendant owed the plaintiﬀ a duty ofcare,thatshehadfailedtoobserveanappropriatestandardofcareandhadthere-\nforebreachedthatduty,andthatshehadcausedthedamage—bothasacausasine\nquanon(butfortheiraction,itwouldnothaveoccurred)andasthe eﬀectivecause,\nwherethereare possiblecompeting orsuccessive causes.

Accountingforcomplicationsandcontingencies\nTheexamplesgivenabovehaveconsistedofunrealisticallyuncomplicatedpropo-\nsitions. Concessions, in particular, are rarely straightforward in authentic legal dis-\ncourse, as there are usually complications that need accounting for.

Reformulation. Once students have ﬁnished struggling with the legal con-\ntent,andhavebeenintroducedtolinguisticdevicesfororganisinginformationattheparagraphandcomplexsentencelevel—allpartofaprocessapproachtowritingthePQA—theyare ready foramoreholisticrevision task.Thiscallsonthem to refor-\nmulatewhole paragraphs, thus combining their sense of what content should be\nincluded,howthereasoningshouldbestructured,andhowtorealizethatstructure\nlinguistically. ‘‘Reformulation’’ was introduced by Joan Allwright (1988) and All-wright, Woodley and Allwright (1988) as a more embedded and holistic means ofworking on students’ writing problems. Allwright was concerned that teachers ten-ded to spoonfeed their students with model solutions they themselves had workedout,thus‘‘militat(ing)againstthedevelopmentofwriterautonomy’’(1988,p.109).In the reformulation approach, students are oﬀered whole texts—from the para-graph upwards—to improve as pieces of contextually appropriate communication.\nThisvehicleoﬀersstudentsawayofcombiningcommunicativeandreasoningprin-\nciples in a practical exercise. In Hong Kong’s monolingual context, nearly all ourstudents share the same Cantonese-to-English problems, and so tend to be able toidentifywiththestudentexampleschosenforreformulation.\nCharles’actionoﬀersusaninterestingreformulationtask,illustratingnicelyhow\ncontent, reasoning and language come together in a synthetic and holistic task.

Applications to other areas of EAP\nAlthoughtheideaspresentedinthispaperhavetheirrootsinworkIhavedonein\nother areas of EAP, notably for Social Sciences students, grappling with the chal-\nlenging area of law has given me the opportunity to re-think or reﬁne those ideas.Each discipline and disciplinary genre has thrown new light on the way I haveapproached the teaching of writing. I have come to focus much more on the stu-dents’ assignments, as central to their—and their teachers’—perspectives on aca-demic writing. The ‘‘rhetorical spectrum’’ I applied to legal genres emerged from\n9JudgesinlatercaesesuchasMcFarlane(1994)haveruledthatsecondaryvictimsshouldnotsuceed\nonthisbasis.ThisisanotherexampleofwhyEAPteachersneedtoremainuptodateinthecontentarea\ninquestion.N.Bruce/EnglishforSpeciﬁcPurposes21(2002)321–345 337\n\n--- Page 18 ---\ntreating those assignments as coherent genres, and I have since attempted to apply\nthe same approach to the more standard academic genres of essays and reports.Appendix C shows how I applied the same principles and approach to the com-\nparative review essay—an essay which gives prominence to a critique of relevant\nliterature. I now focus more on the role of the language of concession and con-tingencyinthoseassignmentsthanIusedto.\nTheteachingpointsaboutendfocusandcommunicativedynamicscanalsohavea\nwiderapplication.Inthelanguageoflogicalargumentation,studentsareadvised,inthe interests of economy, elegance and ‘‘dynamism’’ of expression, to save theirconclusionfortheculminationoftheirparagraph.Iftheycandothisinacomplexsentence, so much the better—but we do not oblige students to attempt such con-\nciseness.

In an ESL-mediumacademic context, I would argue that this can only be done by balancing and inte-grating attention to language and content, by ensuring that any EAP course for\nstudentskeepsaclearsenseofthatintegration,andofthekindoflanguage-content\nspectrumdiscussedearlier.Thisapproachemphasizestheintermediaterolesofpro-ceduralknowledgeandreasoningpatterns,andtheimportanceofattendingtolan-guage in terms ofbothkeyrhetorical structures andlargerargumentative patterns.ItalsopointstotheneedforEAPcoursestofeaturepeerandself-evaluationmoreprominently,especiallyinwriting-centredcurricula.\n6.1.

The course has also proved popularwiththestudents,sinceitclearlyhelpsthemaddresstheproblemsoftacklingcom-plexlegalassignmentswhichfeatureintricateactsofinterpretation,ofstructure,andof rhetorical execution. Howe (1990) makes the point of a Chinese-L1 student of\nlaw:\n(he) can allow the accuracy of his English to disintegrate quite substantially\nunder the pressure of a test, so long as he has the accepted schema and dis-course,clearlyindicatedbyplentifulsignalers(p.233)\nThe kinds of disciplinary ‘‘signaling’’ the EAP for Law teacher needs to become\nfamiliarwitharediﬀerentfromthetime-honoredlogicalconnectivestaughtfornon-\nspeciﬁc argumentation or exposition. There is a great deal that is diﬀerent about\nlegal discourse, but also much that can enrich our understanding of discourse inother domains. We might not go as far as Swales (1986) in advising EAP teachersthat ‘‘being a native speaker is not enough; there must be an apprenticeship to thegenre’’(p.18,citedinHowe,1990,p.235).ButIhavecertainlyformedtheopinionthat in order to undertake the kind of WAC or EAP commitment needed to com-mandtherespectofbothstudentsandteachersofprofessionaldisciplineslikeLaw,ESLteachersneedtomakesomehardchoicesaboutthelegalreadingtheyarepre-\nparedtoundertake,whenpreparingtotakeonacourselikethis,andwhenmarking\neachbatchofPQassignments.N.Bruce/EnglishforSpeciﬁcPurposes21(2002)321–345 339\n\n--- Page 20 ---\n7. Conclusion\nIn this paper I have tried to show how an adjunct-type EAP course can dovetail\nlanguage and content in ways which lead to a continual enrichment of the English\nteacher’s understanding of the relationship between language and the target ‘‘con-tent’’.Ihavetriedtoshowthatwhilethisapproachmakesconsiderabledemandsontheteacher,itcanbeprofessionallyenriching,stretchingtheteacher’sunderstandingofthedynamicsofdisciplinarydiscourses.IhavetriedtosuggestthatEAPteacherscan beneﬁt most from a teaching portfolio that allows them to combine in-depthdiscourse analysis with the opportunity to teach students in more than one dis-cipline.

However, the recent White v Chief Constable of\nWest Yorkshire (1999) decision torequire rescuersto have been in personal danger\nof injury means that her status simply as a rescuer is no longer certain to ensure\nrecovery.\nAlthough Elaine, as Alan’s wife, will be presumed to have the requisite relation-\nshipofloveandaﬀectionwithAlan,sheonlyheardoftheaccidentandsawAlan’sbodyatthehospitallater,sofollowing Alcock,thiswouldbeinsuﬃcienttoqualify\nfor compensation, even though the ‘‘burnt and mutilated’’ nature of Alan’s bodycouldbearguedasconstitutinga‘‘horriﬁc’’sight.However,ElainemaystillrecoverdamagesifshecanshowthatshearrivedattheimmediateaftermathoftheaccidentassetdownbyLordWilberforcein McLoughlin, whererecoverywasallowedwhere\nthe plaintiﬀ came upon the aftermath of the accident within two hours of that\naccident.\nAswithElaine, Fredawillbepresumedtohavearelationshipofloveandaﬀection\nwith Alan.
